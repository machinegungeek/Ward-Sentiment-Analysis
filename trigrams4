Ward is the second work in the Parahumans series , and reading Worm first is strongly recommended .   
A lot of this wo n’t make sense otherwise and if you do find yourself a fan of the universe , the spoilers in Ward will affect the reading of the other work .
Ward is not recommended for young or sensitive readers .
The Glow - worm chapters were a teaser event leading up to Worm 2 .   
They are n’t required reading but offer flavor and additional angles by which to view certain characters .   
They take the form of forum posts , chat conversations and emails .
They ’re best described as a kind of a post - epilogue , pseudo - prologue bridge between the series .   
Those who read them on the Worm site should n’t feel the need to read them again –
they ’re included here for convenience ’s sake , with a few readability improvements .
If you ’re not interested or find this hard to read , click here to jump to chapter 1 .

 Posted on August 15th , Y1 : To call the efforts of everyone involved heroic would be grossly understating things .
This IT project required the efforts of seventy eight PHO staff members , employees of Stateside Online , former officials of the US government , former members of the United States space program , members of international space programs , the Guild ( Masamune in particular ) , and numerous independent experts and volunteers .
At a time when we ’re all stretched thin and there is an incredible amount of work still to be done , seven hundred and eight individuals devoted spare time and valuable resources to get us and six other partners online .
Things will be clunky and frustrating .  
For most , with congestion being what it is , things will be slow enough that people can get a cup of coffee and come back to find the page has n’t fully loaded .   
We ’ve stripped away a bit of the polish and the gloss : the header images , badge graphics and the ability to include video or images are gone for now , to keep things simple and easy .  
We will be moderating very carefully to ensure nobody disrupts anyone
’s ability to access the site .  
It will be painful .   
Help each other , be patient , and contribute the best you can .
In so many ways , things will be frustrating , slow , and painful .   
Care , helpfulness , patience , and contribution will make literal worlds of difference .   
In so many ways .
But we ’re back .   
Stay tuned for bigger , better things .   
Bear with us as we sort through it all .

 @
Dgators – Generally , you want to be careful because you wo n’t get any updates to OS360 or other PC OSes , no patches to your phone .   
There is no tech support and there is little recourse for anyone hit with malware .
Plausibly there ’s a lot of desperate people out there who see that the defenses are down and we ’re in early days .   
It ’s probably easier for someone to come up with new means of attack than it is for anyone to roll out a proper patch .   
Presumably if they wanted to infect systems or get access they would want to do it now when it would probably let them get access to things that follow .

Plenty of people brought laptops and phones and we ’re piecing things together by loading from cache .   
It is more zombie net than real net but we ’re finding things .
There are more coming but people want to delete their search histories before they hand their computers over .

I have access through the portal at the east of the city .   
When I go through I ’ve been doing loops through the old neighborhoods to see what I can scrounge up .   
If you need something to fill major gaps I can try looking .   
If not , I ’m going to see if I can round off my collection .   
Would be nice to have a good excuse if I get accused of smuggling or looting

 Boo - chan 
 Posted on August 17th , Y1 : [ Transcribed from print ]   
Conrad James Freed and his family could tell a harrowing tale of their trip across Earth
Bet ’s America .   
They have finally reached the Northeastern Bet - Gimel portal , hearing rumor of wait times , only to be told there is a possibility they may not be allowed in at all .
They had been driving , hitchhiking and hiking for four months .
“
They are n’t giving us answers , ” he told Bulletin News on Saturday .
Their family had been trying to subsist on their rural property in Wisconsin when the weather took a turn for the worse .   
Though it was June , Conrad says he saw snow falling on the fields where he had planted the first crop of the season .
Two days later , there would be a knock at his door .   
Authorities had flown over and saw the lights of his house .   
They warned him the snowfall and the groundwater was contaminated .   
It would be the last straw , as the unseasonably cold weather had cut into the already thin initial harvest .
Conrad says the authorities wanted him and his family to leave right away .   
“ They did n’t give us a chance to pack .   
One of the men even grabbed my daughter .   
He bruised her wrist , he held her so hard .   
I promised I would cooperate if he would only give us five minutes .   
I was in shock .
”
He and his wife decided to make the harrowing trip to the nearest portal without the assistance of authorities , a decision he says he made on the spur of the moment , after the manhandling of his daughter and the manner in which he was forced from his home .   
“
I came to regret that decision .
”
Conrad ’s story is far from unique .   
Evacuation is still underway even two years and two months after Gold Morning .   
Where things took a turn for the worse for Conrad and his family , and where an undisclosed change in policy may affect uncountable refugees from Earth Bet , is that the border agents have apparently ceased processing refugees .    
Tensions are rising and as the number of people in the refugee settlement slowly climbs and resources are stretched thinner , people are speaking out .   
Conrad says , “ We know there is more than enough space on the other side .   
We see people coming and going
but they wo n’t let us through or even meet us to answer our questions .   
We ’re willing to settle outside of the city .   
I know agriculture
and I know they desperately need farmers .   
Even if they give us a minimum of supplies and tools , it has to be better than this .
”
Bulletin News reached out to authorities and received no response .
–Thoughts ?   
Anyone know what was up ?

They ’re letting people through again now , and they ’re letting a lot through .   
Speculation might have been right .
Article might have been more about political pressure than anything else .

 Replied on August 17th , Y1 : 

Official word is that they wanted to pause and get organized so they could double the number of people coming through .
Does n’t make a lot of sense when it comes to their silence until now .

lots of capes stationed at the portal . 

some thinkers like Squint and Danger Zone are there . 

pretty sure
if you watch how they rotate in and out there will always be one thinker on duty . 

screening refugees ?

Point_Me_@_The_Sky 

Replied on August 17th , Y1 : 
 @
Nakyak – could be .   
Could be that it means less need for pain in the ass background checks with internet running at 33K.    Danger Zone sees likelihood a person commits violence to each and every person around them , recency , flavor of violence .   
Squint sees contraband , possible other hazards .   
Skip background check , move people along .

Speaking of security , there was another thread where someone said something about rock & a hard place ?   
It ’s apparently being talked about a lot among the refugees .

 @
Boosher –
This article , search for Nancy Y ’s statement .   
People traveling across the US to get to portals are being warned about multiple threats .   
Word on the capevine is that with everyone having pulled out , all former quarantine zones are breached .   
In the US and elsewhere .   
Nilbog is the one everyone knows about .   
He ’s in custody , his children are n’t .   
If you ’re paying attention to hero groups and their movements , they ’re making lots of trips out .   
They ’re tired and people say they ’re aloof . 

I say they ’re fighting a hard fight
and they ’re keeping their distance from public and media because they do n’t want us to know it .
► boaty5 

Replied on August 17th , Y1 

they do n’t want to tell us a lot of things .   
what even happened ?   
the world ended and nobody is willing to explain .
► Point_Me_@_The_Sky 
 Replied on August 17th , Y1 
 @
Boosher – a big part of what was being talked about in other similar articles
was the threat of bandits , bad weather , the wasteland and chasms , unstoppable robot armies , the food shortages .   
Edit : Nutty beat me to it .   
Slow internet sucks .   
I think boaty is a good example of why they ’re aloof .   
People want to assign blame .   
Assign the blame to the man who did this .   
In times of crisis , look to the people who are helping .   
Support them or try to be one of them .

I agree for the most part , Point@ , but it ’s more complicated than that .   
I got ta side with boaty .   
We made a covenant with the capes .   
We put up with a lot .   
In exchange , they were supposed to protect us .   
It ’s pretty clear they did n’t .   
Maybe it was impossible .   
That ’s fine .   
But let ’s not ignore that they broke their end of the contract .   
Let ’s not ignore that the PRT is gone , we no longer have non - capes in charge of them , and they have more proportional power than ever .   
Let ’s not ignore that they ’re making a new PRT without any of the key rules that defined the last one .   
Less communication , no oversight .
I ’m scared .   
You should be too .

 Moonsong 

Posted on August 18th , Y1 :
PHO is back on and they are letting the chats run .
That ’s where we usually meet , but I ’ve been warned it ’s choppy and slow .
I ’ll be there .
This took me three hours to just get started with .
It ’s hard .
It is with the heaviest of hearts that I inform you that Coiffure did pass .
When Gold Morning arrived , we suspected something might have happened , given the reports .
She was killed in one of the initial strikes on the East coast .
She was a friend , a teammate , and she was a true hero .
She elevated others around her to be better people by the standards she lived by .
Coiffure is survived by only her father .
Her mother was one of my favorite adults .
She was kind , she was cool , and she was a genuinely good mom to Coiffure .
When we went back to school in the fall , she gave us really cool back to school supplies .
It remains in my memory as one of the most randomly nice things a relative stranger has done for me .
You ’ll also remember her siblings Arthur and Cal , though you might not remember their names .
When the family came by , Arthur would be the one curled up in the big chair near the front desk , with one of his game things .
Cal would be watching over his big brother ’s shoulder .
I always thought it was hilarious how uninterested they were in capes .
We can expect they all died instantaneously .
I ’ve talked to Coiffure ’s father .
I would suggest that if you happen to run into him , leave him be .
He does n’t want reminders .
Furcate decided to fight on that monumental day and that says so much when not everyone was brave enough to do that .
Furcate was wild and tortured and beautiful .
They were a handful and yet they rewarded us with ten positive things for every negative we had to overcome .
I ’d like to think they got something out of putting up with us in much the same way .
I want what I say here to be honest .
I did not get along with Furcate the vast majority of the time .
Furcate did not get along with me .
I still respected them immensely .
They said one word for every thousand the rest of us said
and yet they could convey so much in their actions .
I keep saying those things , using math like ‘ ten times over’ , but it ’s so very Furcate .
They overflowed , they swelled .
The cup runneth over .
I look back
and I ’m dazed by how much of a place they found in my heart and my thoughts .
It might be crass to say , but I do n’t know if anyone ’s going to have words for them .
Scritch and Scratch were the closest thing we had to a nemesis .
They had their scummy moments .
They also kept to the rules .
They were killed during one of the lulls in the fighting , by a group I wo n’t name .
The fates of Tribute , Boundless , Capricorn and Steamwheel are yet unknown .
I hope you guys are okay .
I ’m alive , obviously .
Figurehead is alive but you all should know his issues with being controlled .
The events really shook him .
He ’s retired in large part , he ’ll be doing something capey , but he ’s said he is n’t coming on PHO .
He asked me to wish you all the best .

new skyscrapers every day , new stores .
good and almost like a city in Earth

we ’re all playing nice .

what happens ?
[ A18 11:43:50 ]
Moonsong : It wo n’t .
I do n’t think so anyway .
There ’s a lot of hero teams out there and its hard for a sponsored team to get traction even without people feeling betrayed .
[ A18 11:44:02 ]
Cap :
yeah
[ A18 11:46:14 ]
Moonsong : A lot of teams are gathering under the Wardens .
PRT - like .
They ’re walking a fine line between emulating PRT and being PRT .
Lots of teams under the umbrella .
I ’m not sure it ’s working .
I do n’t know if I want to get on board with that .
I do n’t know if the others would .
[ A18 11:46:23 ]
Cap : that ’s
fair [ A18 11:47:50 ]
Moonsong : I will always be a member of Reach .
Even if the team has dissolved .
[ A18 11:48:42 ]

[ A18 11:48:53 ]

[ A18 11:52:36 ]
Cap : 45 minutes of something approaching civility has to be a record for us [ A18 11:52:57 ]
Moonsong : I see .
Yes .
It could be .
[ A18 11:53:06 ]
Cap : I would have liked to keep that streak going 

[ A18 11:53:20 ]
Cap :
oh well
[ A18 11:54:31 ]
Moonsong : Are you well , Tristan ?
[ A18 11:55:21 ]
Cap : I see we ’re going straight to the barbs [ A18 11:56:32 ]
Moonsong : No barbs .
I genuinely want to know .
[ A18 11:57:14 ]
Cap : how uncharacteristicaly nice of you [ A18 11:58:23 ]
Moonsong :
Do I need to worry about you ?
[ A18 11:58:45 ]
Cap : no 

[ A18 11:58:56 ]
Cap : you “ helped ” more than enough [ A18 12:00:19 ]
Moonsong : I do n’t know .
[ A18 12:01:08 ]
Cap : do n’t you ?
[ A18 12:02:07 ]
Moonsong : I ’ve spent a lot of time hoping you died .
[ A18 12:03:34 ]
Cap : WOW 
 [ A18 12:03:58 ]
Cap : geez [ A18 12:04:06 ]
Moonsong : * shrug * [ A18 12:05:27 ]
Cap : geez .
there is no humanity in there at all is there ? 

[ A18 12:05:51 ]
Cap : just takes the world to end beforeI get a glimpse of the real you [ A18 12:06:45 ]
Moonsong : Lets not pretend , Tristan .
[ A18 12:07:01 ]
Cap : pretend what ? 

[ A18 12:07:42 ]
Cap : you decided you hated me before you ever got to know me 

[ A18 12:08:37 ] Cap : you ’re really your fathers daughter .
two - faced .
anyone reading between the lines can see what you really thought about furcate
[ A18 12:10:39 ]
Moonsong :
I meant what I wrote .
[ A18 12:11:47 ]
Cap : a thinly veiled outline of furcates many problems 

[ A18 12:11:56 ]
Cap : you could n’t resist saying you did n’t like them
[ A18 12:11:23 ]
Moonsong : Are you done ?
[ A18 12:12:13 ]
Cap : you made furcate more miserable than anyone [ A18 12:12:26 ]
Moonsong : Apparently not [ A18 12:12:29 ]
Cap : you never once tried to understand them just like you never once tried to understand me 

[ A18 12:13:12 ]
Cap : you had your notions of how everyone was supposed to behave 

[ A18 12:13:36 ]
Cap : how everyone was supposed to be 

[ A18 12:13:45 ]
Cap : you know what they call people who come to judgment about people before they have the facts ?

Cap : the label applies , moonsong 

[ A18 12:14:29 ]
Cap : you wedged yourself into a situation you did n’t understand and you made it so much worse 

[ A18 12:14:48 ]
Cap : what guts me is you think you were right to do it .
[ A18 12:16:39 ]
Moonsong : I did n’t like furcate .
I did love and respect him as a teammate . 

[ A18 12:16:51 ]
Moonsong : I damn well held him at the end .
For a long time .
I talked to him the entire time . 

[ A18 12:18:23 ]

When I said I was wrong in how I handled things ? 

[ A18 12:49:19 ]

yeah .
how does this work ?
X29V5n :
You into memorabilia then ?
3A::u@T_Enki :
sure .
memorabilia .
I miss my old collection X29V5n :
The person who referred you should have explained most of it 3A::u@T_Enki : some X29V5n : Let ’s say you ’re into commemorative plates .
Plate with a hero or a villian
’s face on it .
You care a lot about the plate and its delivery 3A::u@T_Enki : sure
X29V5n :
We ensure you get the result you want . 

X29V5n :
Insurance 3A::u@T_Enki : sounds like just what I need X29V5n :
We offer tiers .
Different tiers for various degrees of thoroughness .
3A::u@T_Enki : can you give me a quick rundown ?
X29V5n :
Most basic tier , you throw a few hundred our way , depending on who is involved , who we put forward and who you expect is going to need to hear it , words .
We talk , we let them know
we ’re serious about wanting X , Y & Z. No hassle .
We throw our weight around a bit .
Yeah ?
3A::u@T_Enki :
yeah
X29V5n : Maybe you want to ensure that plate ends up in the most ideal condition .
A thousand or a few thousand covers a bit of roughing up .
Scratch on the face , scuffing , the sort of thing that can be fixed up .
3A::u@T_Enki : can we maybe not talk about commemorative plates ?
maybe action figures ?
plates make me think of my abuela X29V5n : If you want more coverage for your action figures , depending if we ’re talking b - lister or a - lister or something bigger , we might be talking upwards of five , ten thou for more severe damage .
Ruined leg , arm , the sort of damage to the face that would take an expert to restore .
3A::u@T_Enki : getting pretty steep X29V5n
: We ’re talking cape shit .
It ’s in high demand , limited supply .
Prices climb .
3A::u@T_Enki : just observing .
is there a higher tier ?
what ’s the highest tier ?
X29V5n : Highest tier covers complete and total destruction .
Pulling out all the stops .
Starts at twenty thou , but I got ta warn you , the sky is the limit .
3A::u@T_Enki : that sounds good X29V5n :
Good .
3A::u@T_Enki : would you be willing to let me pay half upfront ?
we ’d keep you guys in reserve ?
particulars get complicated X29V5n : We work with complicated .
Yes .
That could be workable . 

X29V5n : We will need to negotiate pricing .
Did they tell you how to send the image of the product ?
3A::u@T_Enki : u5zxN8wEXAKpbBeqzvzy.i
X29V5n :
Perfect . 

X29V5n :
No wait . 

X29V5n : You got the instructions very wrong , kid .
3A::u@T_Enki :
it ’s fine X29V5n
: You ’re sure ?
There ’s something deeply wrong with this .
3A::u@T_Enki : why do n’t we meet for the rest ?
I ’ll send you the first half now 

3A::u@T_Enki : there
X29V5n :
Alright .

Topic : Amnesty & The Devil
We Know 

In : Boards ► News ► Events ► Gimel .
US 

E.S.Reaver 

Posted on August 19th , Y1 :
I ’ve seen a few articles and wanted to compile them .
There ’s a narrative here , if you do n’t grasp it then bear with me an
I ’ll sum up my thoughts at the end .
Article :
Strange Reversals : Villain to Hero & Forum Thread 

The number of heroes is rising .
Multiple known villains have shucked off the black capes for white ones .
Which is a good thing , right ?
Article :
No Witnesses
Remain & Forum Thread 

The article identifies three villains who we know about in heroic groups – two with the Wardens and one with Shelter .
They committed crimes , we have some limited information or scraps of wiki articles , but the witnesses of those past crimes are either dead or yet to establish themselves .
We established standards for amnesty , but sometimes those standards ca n’t be met .
The ex - villains find places on the team with nobody to naysay .
Article :
Two Black Raincoats & Forum
Thread 

Let ’s get to the examples .
Four youths tried to get superpowers by working off of the ‘ trigger’ theory of power gain , and became a newsworthy case in 2004 .
The event got out of hand , one boy and one girl took charge and preyed on the two younger members of the group , torturing them over the course of a weekend .
Nobody gained powers , the search for the missing children led to the two older children being identified as they went into town on the Monday to get food and buy power tools , including a circular saw .
They revealed the location of their victims ; one of whom apparently lost fingers as the wire that was used to attach them to the toilet tank was too tight .
Unnamed Boy was sent to juvie .
Unnamed Girl was sent to psychiatric care .
Both gained powers while in care , both were released in or around 2009 .
Reuniting , now with powers , they killed three people , wearing black raincoats to keep the blood off , and were not caught .
They have been spotted in several locations at the Rochester span , wearing the black raincoats .
“
For the time being , the amnesty applies , ” Chief Armstrong stated to the media .
“
We know where they are and we ’re keeping tabs .
”
Good enough ?
Article : “
Rended ” , “ Torn Up ” ,
“ Dismembered ” & Forum Thread 
 Written after Miss Militia and Vista , heroines under the Wardens , were seen on several occasions in the company of Hellhound , also known as Bitch or Rachel Lindt .
Raises questions about the moral compromise the amnesty has wrought and the longstanding allegations that the Protectorate team in Brockton Bay was cooperating with the local villains .
Once the relationship is established and we ’re reminded of the past examples , the article devotes the latter half to reminding us of some of Rachel Lindt ’s deeds when she was working with a group of warlords to seize Brockton Bay .
“
Every day , I wake up and I try to move my leg .
The wind gets knocked out of me when it does n’t move like it should .
If I ’m active at all during the day , then the pain hits me in the evening .
”
Article : Fallen : What You Need To Know & Forum Thread 

The Fallen operate as a cult and they ’re one of the largest cape groups around .
The article does n’t talk about it directly , but the forum thread has some great posts on the subject ( see page 3 and 12 ) .
Their recruitment numbers are swelling and I ( and others ! )
think it ’s the amnesty that ’s letting them get away with it .
There ’s a lot of talk of Lachlan Hund [ article linked ] elsewhere and there might be a court case revolving around what others are saying was a powers - assisted abduction .
Totally Fallen M.O. for years prior , family says Lachlan never showed any pro - Fallen sentiment before this .
Article :  
No Cost & Forum Thread 
 Same article author as ‘ No Witnesses Remain’ .
Following up on several villains who did n’t turn hero , the author finds two villains , both anonymous , who claim they received accommodations , at a time when many were still living in the tent cities .
They got ahead of the ‘ line’ , they got basic apartments and utilities paid for , and they contribute nothing except the fact that they are n’t ( as far as we know ) committing crimes these days .
It ’s like we ’ve caved to extortion .
We need to have a dead serious conversation about the amnesty .
Justice should n’t fall by the wayside .
Absolutely horrific individuals get their second chances but they get them at the expense of the safety and peace of mind of others .
They get things easier .
We heard the arguments why at the start .
We had other things to think about and deal with .
Heroes had other things .
We thought .
We dealt .
The heroes handled the biggest needs .
That was then .
Do n’t get me wrong .
I ’m not buying into the anti - cape sentiment you see here and there .
But I ’m anti - these - capes .
I ’m
anti - this .

mlekk thinks they would want to attack the doors

What ’s wrong with extortion ?
What ’s wrong with taking measures ?
If you stand at the bottom of a hill and a car starts rolling down it with nobody in the drivers seat what do you do ?
The way some of you imbeciles are talking about this I ca n’t help but think you would stand there bitching about the situation until the car hits you .
Get out of their way first and then make sure it was n’t one part of bigger problem or disaster .
Then and only then do you address the problem with your indignation and sense of injustice cold , clear , and gripped in steady hands .
Find some weapon or power and take action .

 1 ) villains are n’t cars .
villains are humans .
they ’re accountable for their actions . 

2 ) we have more choices than ‘ get out of their way’ .
We ’re part of a greater society .
We have the choice of catering to them or treating them like the scumbags they are .
we ’re accountable for how we respond to them .
our government is accountable for how they respond to them . 

3 ) ‘ imbeciles’ is n’t helping foster good discussion 
 4 )
can someone please ban mlekk ?
They ’re in every other thread .
Admin said they would deal with low - investment content 
 5 ) why the fuck is mlekk one of the only people with working badges ?
► Mangled_Wings 

Replied on August 19th , Y1 : 

There are three kinds of villain .
There are villains at rest that do n’t do anything unless bothered and they may be easy to bother .
Do n’t bother them unless you ’re sure you ’re stronger than them .
If you do n’t have powers you are n’t stronger than them .
There are villains in motion .
They want something or they ’re going somewhere .
Do n’t get in their way unless you ’re a lot stronger than them .
Catch them from the flanks or from behind if you ’re strong and clever enough .
These two kinds of villain do n’t budge .
I ’ve known a lot of them .
I know how they operate .
It takes a lot to move the ones at rest and it takes a lot to change the course of the ones in motion .
You ca n’t do either .
Do n’t try .
The third kind is the kind worth paying attention to and they ’re the ones that are changing or that can change .
Objects in motion stay in motion and objects at rest stay at rest and the times and situations to watch out for are when they change states .
The people bitching here do n’t know enough and do n’t have the power to handle any of that .
Get stronger .
Get smarter .
Leave it to the people who know stuff to tell each group apart and to know when to handle things .

You act like you ’re the only one who understands the situation 

What guarantee is there that they ’re ever going to handle things ? 

People and institutions do what is easiest .

Adding articles , part III ( Keeping to OP ’s format ) : Valkyrie Interviewed and Thread Link 
 Rising star in the Wardens .
Exceptionally powerful , many references to the Green Maiden or something ?
Might harken back to before my time .
She is asked directly about this in the interview and deflects .
Shepherd ’s
Crook and Thread Link ( not many posts ) 

Team started up and fell apart .
Reason why ?
One ex - nemesis and lover of the team leader was invited to the team .
They went full yoko .
Shepherds no more .
Endemic is the word .

Like me , New_Ohmstar .
I have worked with more than twenty villains .
I am a villain .
When I give you recommendations about leaving sleeping dogs alone I am referring to myself .
When I tell you that you want to get out of the way if I have something I want ?
Referring to myself .
I am not one of the leeches .
I pay for my own apartment .
I make no trouble .
Yet .
Yes I am talking to the heroes .
They keep their eye on me
and I keep my eye on them .
There are other factors .
This makes degrees of sense you are not equipped to comprehend .
For now it is fine and you should take my word for it .
I ’m aiming to get stronger .
I ’m aiming to get smarter .
I am not the only one doing this .
If you spend your time bitching on the internet instead of doing the same then you ’re one of the imbeciles because things are changing and you will fall behind .
I can verify any of this if I must
but I do n’t know how as I am new to this site .

Hello to you too . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : Click on your username while reading any thread you ’ve posted in .
Go to the Help panel .
There will be a list of options .
Third box , second option , badge verification You might want to open a new window so you can go back from this convo to that Mangled_Wings :
It says import image .
Point_Me_@_The_Sky
: Take a picture of yourself in costume and a piece of paper with your username on it .
Connect phone or camera to computer .
Find the image and select it , hit the ‘ select’ button on the bottom corner of the window .
Mangled_Wings :
I do n’t have a phone or camera .
Point_Me_@_The_Sky : Does your computer have a camera built into the monitor ?
Mangled_Wings :
Yes .
Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
OS360 ?
Mangled_Wings :
Yes .
I think .
Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
Draw the circle in the center of the desktop to open the radial menu .
Hit ‘ C’ and camera should be something visible .
Open it , wait for your image to appear .
You ’ll want to be in costume .
Hit space .
Mangled_Wings :
It made a shutter sound .
Point_Me_@_The_Sky : You were in costume already ?
Mangled_Wings :
It ’s fine .
Point_Me_@_The_Sky
: Sure .
You ’ll find the picture in the ‘ pictures’ bubble Mangled_Wings : Thank you .
I found it .
I imported it .
It wants me to put in a label before I hit select .
Point_Me_@_The_Sky : ‘ Villain’ , I guess .
I do n’t know if you really want to do that .
You might want to go ‘ Cape’ if you want to fly under the radar .
People are sore about villains these days .
Mangled_Wings :
I do n’t fly under the radar .
I know what I am
and I know what I ’ll be , if I do n’t die first .
Thank you for the help .
I respect this more than I respect the more self - pitying of the invertebrates out there .
Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
Alright . 
 
Point_Me_@_The_Sky : I ’m unfortunately afflicted with desire to help people .
Mangled_Wings :
A dire inflection , that .
Point_Me_@_The_Sky : 0 : )
I do n’t know if you ’re at rest or moving or if you ’re open to change , but you catch more flies with honey than vinegar .
Things will go smoother if you do n’t call them invertebrates or imbeciles 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
And maybe stay at rest a little longer , given the chance ? 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : I think they really need it 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
We all need it . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
Also .
It just occurred to me .
If you connect at a library , you ’ll want to delete the image before you go .
Overwrite it once it is deleted to be sure .
Mangled_Wings :
You kill more flies with vinegar in reality . 

Mangled_Wings :
A person can rest only so long .
I ’m restless .
Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
What a pity . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : Spend more time online .
Geek out .
Learn !
Less time spent being bad !
Mangled_Wings :
I am not averse to learning .
We will see if there is any pity to be had . 

Mangled_Wings :
I am at a library .
I will do that .
Point_Me_@_The_Sky : You can draw the circle and hit ‘ o’ to find overwrite .
Mangled_Wings :
I already found it .
Thank you .

Topic : [ JRPNA ]
Use of Cluster Powers , Serial Powers , Matched Powers , and Nth - generation Powers to identify ‘ Hinge Points’ in Power Expression – 1998 

In : Boards ► Parahuman Science 
 Azavael ( PRT Science ) 

Posted on : June 4th , 2002
[ Article ]
Studies into Parahuman abilities presently catalogue studied powers into three major databases : the PRT database in the US , the Cambridge Parahuman Studies facility , and the EUJP International Listing .
The lists are formed by way of interview and laboratory studies with each institution using universally standardized forms in addition to supplementary material .
Each of these three institutions have stated an express or strongly - implied desire to understand and predict expressions of power and tie these expressions to the inciting incidents .
However , a longstanding problem in this process is that powers expressed , inciting incidents , and contextual factors can be dramatically different across individual cases .
While some common themes can be drawn out , derived results are traditionally very big - picture .
It is only recently that databases have begun to include sufficient numbers of special - case triggers that allow more focused study of how powers are expressed .
We identified cluster powers , serial powers , matched powers , and Nth - generation powers as the special cases to focus on in more focused examination of how power instances can be mapped and we posit a ‘ Hinge Point’ illustration of power expression and theory .
[ Definitions ] • Cluster powers are defined as powers wherein multiple inciting incidents occur either simultaneously or within a minute of one another .
Such parahumans will have a collection of smaller powers related to the others .
•
Serial powers are defined as cases where an individual or multiple individuals in longstanding proximity to a parahuman will develop powers …

It ’s good to keep track and note this .
This article was pretty important to the time .
It would be worth finding someone with it in print and transcribing .
Keep letting us know .
It helps us track which articles are most important & desired .
What ’s your field ?

⊙ ♦ Topic : Multi - Trigger Case Studies – Parahumans 303 Class Notes ( Spinky ) – September 15th 2009 

In : Boards ► Parahuman Science ► Non - Articles 
 Rightsector 
 Posted on : September 17th , 2009
From Wednesdays with Prof Spinky .
Posted with permission .
Cleaned up where I could Overview : What are clusters ? 

Other names are mosaic
p. expression , grabbag , multi 
 Effect on resulting power 

Why important & Importance to study . 

Case studies 

Greater effects , things to keep in mind Pt . 1 :
What are clusters ? 

2 - 6 people trigger at same time or very close together .
Each gets a suite of powers .
Person A gets Person
A primary power and fragment of B , C , D , E , F. 
 Person B gets Person B primary power and fragment A , C , D , etc .
Pt 2 : Effect on resulting power 
 Term secondary expressions .
Weaker or subtle power .
Can be conditional . 

Primary powers may be weaker than if they had triggered alone ? 

Powers inspired by others but not identical .
Relation may be tertiary . 

Example given firebreath - > fire something or something breath 

Prof stresses this is very basic example 

Term for staying element is hinge ( old ) or dominant ( current ) .
Relates to 1998 article .
Pt 3 : Why important & importance to study 
 Suggests powers are n’t 100 % predetermined .
Certain elements are highlighted or made dominant . 

We can extrapolate from studies like this & serial triggers to work out key elements of existing triggers .
What changes & why = what factors are important in standalone non - special trigger ?
Case Studies : two cases & how we look at them 

Two case studies .
Interview , self - reporting , examination Case Study # 1 :
Sunder Bros 
 Take note for future week : matched powers .
We come back to this . 

Brother # 1 – Destruction caused to objects ripples out indefinitely , stopping at clear demarcations ( images included in lecture notes ) .
Weapon extension without limit ( except convenience ) 

Brother # 2 –
Weapon sweep extension – some range extension – wider arcs , shockwaves left / right of swing .
Stomp to destroy ground in immediate area .
Class pauses , prof asks & responds to input re : dominant factors in each power .
Cute girl in red top finally comes up with answer that satisfies Spinky .
Destruction & weapon attack augmentation
dominant / staying / hinge factors .
Question of range vs. breadth between brothers .
Not very lopsided in power difference b / w primary & secondary power .
Spinky ’s stress on not .
We get some slides of brother ’s recreation of trigger circumstance .
Distance from threat .
Prof Spinky highlights personality traits brothers used on forms they filled out .
All as reasoning for different power expressions .
Case Study # 2 :
Fowl & Fair ( foreign capes , names that follow are badly translated ) 

Oxfair – Physical augmentation ; size , strength , speed , agility ( < - primary ) , deafening roar , transfer harm from falls / some impacts to nearby others , pain resistance / faster healing 

Ramfair – Emotion affecting chant , size increase , some ability to heal very recent damage of others listening to chant / that touching , gather strength / concentrate - > giant
leaps 

Foulcock ( yes , the class laughed )
– Flight with build - up of speed over time , speed is transferred to touched others , interrupting flight to deliver high - impact blows .
Increased agility , deafening shriek , fast recovery of smaller wounds ( scratches yes , no recovery of larger wounds ) . 

Foulpig – Personal biokinesis , swell into flesh bubble with fast recovery / personal mutations if not ‘ popped’ in time .
Some strength & size increase , but slower while grown .
Ability to ‘ roll’ with incoming impacts ( mover expression ?
Turns into boulder ) .
Guttural noise ( flatulence ? Burps ? ) to interrupt thought processes – turn off others’ brains momentarily .
Discussion of dynamic .
Fair & foul on opposite sides post - trigger .
Only fair provided answers & allowed power testing , rest has to be inferred .
Handouts .
Some discussion of trigger event ( see slides for images ) , some discussion of resulting ‘ package’ .
Powers for each individual distinct but play off each other in semi - complementary way .
Reflective of personality ?
Or ‘ guiding hand’ principle ?
Pt . 4 :
Greater effects & things to keep in mind –
things touched on in homework reading : 

Kill / Kiss – more on this in parahuman psychology class in a few weeks 

Personality Bleed –
personality traits bleed over from 1 individual to other ?
Messy 

Higher incidences of paranoia , confrontation , aggression , PTSD .
Less bounce back ? 

Higher rate of death post - trigger .
Kill / kiss again .
Graph 

Prof Spinky stresses emotional states may play into the above .
Triggers that are sufficient to draw in multiple individuals are worse than average .
Ca n’t jump 2 conclusions .
Correlation = /= causation .

In : Boards ► Parahuman Science 
 Jr_Max 

Posted on : February 18th , 2005
[ Translation ] Colloquially known as the kill / kiss dynamic , in cluster - triggers , there is a very high tendency toward passionate relationships , either hostility or partnership .
Clusters have a 40 % chance of one member murdering another , rising to a 50 % chance when including attempted murder , 25 % chance of a partnership forming , and a 10 % incidence of partnership and murder coinciding .
The term partnership is used for romantic pairings in instances where sexuality and gender allow , and close friendship or formed teams with members in other cases .
In some ( 10 % of ) cases of close partnerships forming , the romantic pairing occurred despite one ’s typical sexuality .
The relationship entanglement study looks at existing cases and clusters to investigate why .
The most dramatic case in recent memory is the Stáj , also known as the Stable , or the Foul and the Fair .
The Good Ox was turned into a grisly display [ … ]

We were ultimately unable to stop them , as they had two capes
we had no information or records on .
The first of the capes may have been a thinker , likely the same that shot down our flier .
We were unable to glean much more from them , other than the fact they wore fur in the midst of a heatwave . 
 
The second individual seems to be a grab - bag cape .
She was a woman with a fanged mask covering her lower face , and a form - fitting dress with a slit up the side of one leg .
She displayed a mover power [ fourth term ] with the ability to run on walls .
She produced an emotion - affecting [ third term ] roar , which broke the ranks of one of the cooperating teams , and had metal claws [ second term ] which looked to be of tinker make .
These claws may have been what enabled her to tear [ First term not met , but within allowance ] down doors and other barricades with the ease she did .
We have the beginnings of a work - up going online shortly .
The attack on the store opening was a failure on our side .
We were late to the scene due to geography and we lacked full knowledge of our adversaries .
It is our belief that with PHO in working order and more collaborative tools and measure being put in place every day , that we will succeed next time where we failed this once .
We are working with authorities to keep an eye out for the stolen merchandise .

Dear Applicant ( Point_Me_@_The_Sky@mail )
We regret to inform you that your application for graduate study in our department was turned down .
We look at each application and applicant as a whole and decisions are based on a composite of information including your previous academic performance , referrals , relevant professional activities , proposed research statements , and test scores .
Due to a high volume of applicants , this message has been partially automated .
Your application was received by paper and email and discussed by me and one other faculty member .
We responded by email as per your preference .
We would like to stress , for your particular application : 

•
That we would very much like you to apply again in future years . 

•
That we would encourage you to use the same email address , as we can easily tie it back to this application . 

•
We felt your academics were very strong . 

•
We felt your extracurriculars were exceptional . 

•
We felt your references were exceptional . 

•
In a time when records are often lacking and references may be hard to identify or contact , your application stood above and beyond in how complete and thorough it was .
Nilles is one of three Universities serving an estimated population of fifty million on Earth Gimel and its associated territories , and it is the sole post - secondary institution offering graduate studies .
Over one and a half million bright and eager minds have applied to Nilles in avid hope of starting or resuming their educations , and regretfully , with our current facilities , we can not accept more than twenty thousand .
Although these circumstances mean we must regretfully send you an unfavorable response , we appreciate your application .
We wish you the best in your future endeavors and look forward to hearing from you next year .
Yours truly ,

I ’m assuming that in a matter of days , if you ’re an avian of some sort … Curious_Cephalopod : Insect .
Yes , I could supply a different verification image … 
 Curious_Cephalopod :
… so can we chalk this up to a peculiarity of mine ?
Powers weirdness ?
A_real : I ’ll have to discuss with others .
Curious_Cephalopod :
alright
A_real :
I ’m not wholly satisfied with this resolution .
Either you were joking about something serious 

A_real :
Or you ’re being cavalier about something serious Curious_Cephalopod :
Or I ’m being watched and I ’ve been under various kinds of observation for some time … 

Curious_Cephalopod :
… and
this is n’t that serious .
Consider me a curious sort of multi - limbed invertebrate who would be happy to be left alone … 

Curious_Cephalopod :
… except there ’s always someone on the other side of the glass , tapping or taking notes .
Ears pressed up against the walls .
constant whispers … 
 Curious_Cephalopod :
… things moved in my habitat when I ’m not looking
…
A_real
: I think I have a sense of what you ’re getting at .
Curious_Cephalopod :
… anohd thgis poartiocular obdserver is benign A_real : ?
Curious_Cephalopod : software glitch .
it does n’t like interruptions
A_real : I see . 

A_real
: I ’m putting you down as a verified cape , with some notes .
I ’m not going to make this available to anyone looking at your profile unless you want it .
Curious_Cephalopod :
I do n’t A_real :
I would like to link all of your 32 accounts together .
This might take a few hours of fiddling on my end .
It would only be info available to us and to you Curious_Cephalopod : and to any outside parties with access to my computer ?
A_real : I would avoid letting anyone have that access , if possible .
Curious_Cephalopod : that will be fine .
I will try and I ’m fine with being linked up .
A_real
: Thank you for cooperating .
Have a good day .

Topic : Multiversal Travel Warnings 

In : Boards ► Gimel .
US 
 Khain ( Guild Staff ) 

Posted on August 22nd , Y1 :
The Guild is presently established in three facilities outside of the city in Gimel .
US , supporting authorities and serving as bodyguards and representatives for the onetime denizens of Earth Bet , as new areas are surveyed and contact with new cultures is made .
The process is exciting and interesting , and we report back as much as we are able , but it does have its hazards .
After two recent incidents , we have decided to reach out to those we are familiar with , who are familiar with us .
This forum is one of many places we ’ll be striving to communicate needs and necessities .
Humans are explorers by nature .
Our best count right now , excepting areas we can not fully access , is that portals , devices , and tears between realities are currently allowing access to forty - seven Earths .
Six of those Earths have been blocked off due to implicit threats or are fundamentally inaccessible .
Two more have been closed off at the request of their denizens .
Earth Aleph , which most Earth Bet residents are or were familiar with , has been blocked off as well .
Speak with authorities before making any trips to territories unknown .
We do n’t and ca n’t mount effective rescue operations if someone leaves and fails to return , but we have some ability to do so if and when authorities know where you ’ve gone
and you ’ve stuck to the established route .
People got lost or stranded in the wilderness on Earth in 2012 , with all that world ’s satellites .
It can and will happen in new universes .
Do not travel to inhabited worlds .
Absolutely do not make first contact .
The first of the two incidents noted above was one where a family traveled across Earth Chamesh and happened across a settlement we were currently talking to .
Much confusion and concern was had and we are still recovering .
The second is to please stick to charted territories .
Exploring the uncharted is exciting , but if you are n’t equipped , you can come to harm , even if the world is uninhabited .
One ex - Bet government ( which shall remain unnamed ) sent one expedition to Earth Achat .
The Europe of that world was home to an invasive species , which grew as a tubular mold in dark , shadowed spaces , particularly in forest .
Eating food exposed to the spores these molds created causes stomach cramps that progress to reflexive vomiting over the course of two to five days .
The vomiting then lasts another two to five days , causing death by dehydration for any who do n’t receive care .
Be aware : 

• Earth Gimel has been partially explored and checked by thinkers .
There are no guarantees .
Except for some rare indigenous colonies , it is unsettled .
Gimel has five major points of settlement , with civilization finding its foothold around these points .
The City , as of yet unnamed , is the primary US point of settlement and one of the primary waypoints .
The City is a megalopolis with a commonly cited population of fifty million .
A rough map ( one month out of date ) here . 

•
Earth Mem has been partially settled by others from Bet .
We are currently trying to establish some kind of communication and link . 

For novice explorers and those looking to settle new territories , we would encourage Gimel and Mem as largely safe options .
•
Earth
Bet has been deemed uninhabitable .
Contrary to popular belief , radiation is not a major concern .
However , many industrial sites were either destroyed or have weathered the last two years of neglect poorly , with chemicals leeching into groundwater and settling in valleys .
Terrible numbers of deceased humans and other living species have led to other health concerns , particularly in previously heavily settled areas that received heavy damage .
There will always be those who attempt to hold onto what we have lost , and many persist in trying to maintain some existence on Bet .
However , new incidents arise on what seems to be a weekly or twice - weekly basis , with one in three having to do with powers , the powered , untended tinker technology , masters , and lingering threats .
We may one day return to Bet , as some groups have fervently expressed a desire to do , but we have a great deal of work to do before this is possible .
It may not happen in our generation or our children ’s generation .
Be aware that if you choose to return to Bet ( and most authorities agree you have the fundamental right to do so ) you may have to re - apply for entry and you will very likely be putting your well being in peril .
Speak with authorities before traveling to any other worlds .
More information on multiversal threats .
More information to be disclosed about outside threats and cultures as we have it .

It ’s about concentration .
The fight happened near here .
Scion attacked .
We do n’t know why
but it might have had to do with the Slaughterhouse Nine , going by the news reports and
what some have said .
It might have had to do with the Simurgh .
It could have been something else altogether .
But things wrapped up near here .
People came through and most of us picked two worlds to settle in , with Gimel as the big one .
But a lot of people fought .
A lot of capes .
Many were foreign .
The fight ended … and then ?
We are doing or did our best to get them home , but not all want to go home .
Or Scion did n’t leave them a home to go back to .
A lot of them have gathered into like groups .
That ’s where we get the weird corner - world settlements .
► Venturain 
 Replied on August 22nd , Y1 : 

the corner world places are n’t inherently bad tho , right ?
we ( my family ) just got into the city one month ago .
right away pressure pressure .
we can move into city but standardized rent and we need to earn wage and we may be asked to move .
best option is to move to city periphery and farm .
they say they will give us tools and resources to get started but good spots are taken or very far away and farming is n’t easy corner worlds are closer in a way .
go to noon , go to wherever from there .
if we are n’t reconstruction or farming we are n’t wanted .
so why become cogs in the city ’s machine ?
we can strike off on our own .
minor risk but total freedom ► Slayer of Isaac 

Replied on August 22nd , Y1 : 
 @
Venturain –
that was our mindset .
My family tried it . 

We had the bad fortune of settling at one corner settlement .
Two points removed .
We got off to an okay start .
Shelter up , food out , basic needs covered .
Regular trips to the city to supply up and cover more advanced needs .
Winter of Year Zero caught us off guard .
We thought we were ahead of what we needed but staying warm gets hard and getting warm means chopping wood , which means physical effort , which means needing more food .
I was handling most trips into the city .
I was worn out and got real sick .
My brother handled one trip , asked for help , came back with capes .
They helped , yeah .
Then they took over .
It was bad .
You can find my photo diary on my user page .
My brother went out and asked for help again .
The second time around , the capes were willing to fix the problem and leave .
Most of us moved back to the city .
Bitter feelings .

 @
Venturain – there
’s need for other work .
doctors .
teachers .
there ’s a need for people that are good at finding and vetting the skilled labor .
finding qualified doctors and getting them to hospitals , finding teachers and helping to establish new schools .
organization is the hardest part .
many injured , many with special needs .
i ’m in robotics and prosthetics
and there ’s no shortage of need .
my friend is a radiologist and he ’s in high demand .

Many of those things require education .
Letters started arriving yesterday .
Rejected , rejected , rejected .
No education .
My friends are saying government is holding off on setting up schools because there is so much need for physical labor , industry , agriculture .

Right now we do n’t seem to have many threats at home .
Things are quiet .
The monsters are out there if they ’re even alive .
Sleeper is still in Zayin and seems contained there .
The Birdcage was abandoned and we do n’t know if the residents were left to starve .
Few of the real monsters seem to be here .
The dictators do n’t have the infrastructure .
Our best capes are off doing good work and seeing what ’s out there .
Our capes at home are calm and quiet .
I ’m
okay with that .
► Fishmon 
 Replied on August 22nd , Y1 : 

Not all of the dictators .
Not every place was ruined .
There are monsters out there who I will not name out of fear for my safety .
They were kept in check back on Bet
and nothing holds them back now that much of the world has evacuated .
The weather may be bad there but they may not have had industry or other problems to taint things .
Things are looking up here
but there I think it may be hellish for the citizens .
Who can help them ?
Is difficult .
If calamity comes in plague or bugs or rats then the people suffer , but dictators will not let them escape .
I make calls every day .

Cap : I do n’t know that much Mangled_Wings :
You know some .
You were a corporate hero .
Heart_Shaped_Pupil :
Share .
Do n’t be shy .
😉 Cap : I was a man on the ground in a flashy costume .
I was told to do things
and I did them .
my mental energy went toward figuring out what I would do when I had discretion . 

Cap : Some of it .
of5 :
I know what you mean about mental energy .
Cap : right ?
time management is a nightmare even without complications .
add family , team drama , having to look good for the cameras and magazines and I was n’t exactly thinking about upper management .
I listened to the boss and I winked at the intern with the cute butt sometimes . 

Cap : I did n’t dwell on the ins and outs .
so if you want me to supply info on the ins and outs of how the corporate capes work as a business , I ca n’t .
I do n’t even want to dwell on it .
those were bad times for me .
there ’s a reason I left it behind .
Mangled_Wings :
I hope you can share what you do know at some point .
Cap :
Of course .
Heart_Shaped_Pupil :
Spending a lot of mental energy lately , R ?
of5
: I might have to go to ground .
I may not be able to travel to the next town to use library hookup until our next meeting .
I have some indications that some people are after me .
More than they were the day before yesterday .
Cap : do you need me to come ?
My brother and I can visit , hang out , offer you some backup .
I might not remember much about the nuances of the corp team , but I have pride in my ability in a scrap of5 : I appreciate that .
Cap : it could be fun .
you ’re the closest thing I have to a best friend atm , so we might as well hang at some point .
of5 :
Oof .
Yes .
We get along best , out of the group .
It would be good in other times , maybe .
But I do n’t know what vectors they can use to attack or track me .
This whole thing is a mess .
Cap :
I ’m
so glad I do n’t have to deal with the cluster - trigger clusterfuck Heart_Shaped_Pupil :
Amen .
Mangled_Wings :
Agreed .
of5
: Easiest if I just drop off the radar for a bit .
We can touch base later .
I might check in to see if S showed and we can go from there .
Otherwise I see you in a few days .
Cap : help is available if you need it .
Heart_Shaped_Pupil :
i was going to say .
i ’d ♥ love ♥ to be of help of5
: I ’m safe where I am for now .
in a sense .
Heart_Shaped_Pupil :
With family ?
of5 :
Mostly .
Obviously not when I ’m here .
Hard to strike a balance .
It ’s not good times .

Curious_Cephalopod : please , K. Let it be .

Cap : C. good to see you stepping out of the shadows .

Mangled_Wings :
The shadows are where the real monsters lurk Curious_Cephalopod : that too , A … 
 Curious_Cephalopod : … that too .
Cap : why are you curious , out of curiosity ?
Heart_Shaped_Pupil :
Doing research ?
Curious_Cephalopod : curious in the british sense … 
 Curious_Cephalopod :

 Curious_Cephalopod : … I was doing research , as a matter of fact .
Mangled_Wings :
On ?
Curious_Cephalopod : figuring out the landscape .
looking at maps .
where we want to set up .
Cap : and ? Curious_Cephalopod : and it feels like the A - listers are busy .
everyone else is in the shadows … 

Curious_Cephalopod : … waiting for someone else to break the peace and take the hate when they get blamed … 

Curious_Cephalopod : …
the problem is we ’re so geographically spread out .
even if we discount R. of5 : I ’m aiming to move into the city .
There are complications Heart_Shaped_Pupil : your friend of5 : a lot of things .
Curious_Cephalopod :  
the megalopolis makes for bad logistics .
Cap : I do hope you ’ll step out of those shadows more , c. 

Cap : it ’s been interesting talking to you online and seeing how talkative you are here . 

Cap : I like what you contribute when you speak up Curious_Cephalopod :

On the topic of positivity … Curious_Cephalopod : ?
Did you disconnect ?
Heart_Shaped_Pupil :
So I was thinking we should meet in the city .
You were talking about logistics
and I was thinking about where eveyrone was .
you ’re closest to me and we ’re the same age I think ?
So I was thinking we could meet and talk strategy over fast food .
We could even do something after and build team bonds and things like that .
Maybe a movie or arcade .
Whatever you want to do . 

Heart_Shaped_Pupil :
No pressure . 

Heart_Shaped_Pupil :
Sorry .
I wrote and rewrote that three times Curious_Cephalopod :
You mean a date ?

I did n’t say a date .
Curious_Cephalopod :
But you mean a date .

Maybe .
Sure .
Springtime of youth and all that pizazz . 

Heart_Shaped_Pupil :
Or pre - springtime . Tweentime of spring ?
The thawing of the slush does n’t have the same conotations Curious_Cephalopod : I think there are about a hundred different reasons why I should say no to that .
actually … 

Curious_Cephalopod : … make that two hundred .
I legitimately think I could name two hundred reasons why that ’s a terrible idea .

Really ?
Two hundred ?
Curious_Cephalopod :
The more I think of it , the more reasons I come up with … 
 Curious_Cephalopod : … no

Hello .
Shower :
Thank you for the prompt response .
I ’m
Graham .
I ’m with the PHO IT team .
You can call me by my name or just ‘ shower’ .
Heart_Shaped_Pupil :
Hi Shower .
What can I do for you ?
Shower :
We had some unusual search activity that seemed to be causing congestion .
Would you happen to know anything about this ?
Heart_Shaped_Pupil :
I might .
It would have been during off - peak hours though .
Shower :
We update infrastructure during off - peak hours .
it slowed us down .
It stalled us for three hours last night .
Heart_Shaped_Pupil :
oh that ’s not good .
Shower :
You ’re piggybacking off of our servers ?
Heart_Shaped_Pupil :
I was trying to help .
We ’ve been updating the wikis as much as we can and three - fifths of the work is gathering data that ’s helpful to others .
Shower :
We ?
Heart_Shaped_Pupil :
It was a stupid hobby project .
I was thinking of what everyone wanted
the most and information seemed most critical .
I had some guys I knew from way before
and I thought I ’d get everyone up to date and on the same page .
Shower :
We often encourage hobby projects on PHO , though we can not when resources are as tight as they are , and it would depend on scale and the amount of mess created .
How easy is this to dismantle , and do I need to talk to anyone else ?
Heart_Shaped_Pupil :
Nobody else .
It was me alone .
I can fix it right now . 

Heart_Shaped_Pupil :
How bad of a problem is this ?
Is there any leeway ?
Shower :
It ’s interfering with others’ ability to access things .
It might not seem like a problem here , because you ’re close to the home node , but there are people on the periphery or far - flung regions and they ’re going from satellite to ground to satellite to here , across several Earths . 

Shower :
I think it ’s best if you clean up as much of it as you can .
Shower :
I think that since you ’re a chat member in good standing , we ’d be willing to let this slide with a warning if it can be promptly dealt with without any mess .

I ’ve been called Queen Dark twice and King Dark once .
Heart_Shaped_Pupil :

What does it mean ?
there are no dictionary websites that explain .

In a good way , I think .
Because you and I are on the same side . 

Heart_Shaped_Pupil :
Your voice does n’t translate well .

C is the intimidating one here .

C is ?
Heart_Shaped_Pupil :
Funny , is n’t it ?
Mangled_Wings :
I think I hate the internet to the very center of my being .
Heart_Shaped_Pupil :
If you think about it , with powers and all , the center of your being could include the vast monster in another dimension that ’s all hooked up into you .
Passenger stuff .
The center of mass could be in the middle of an alien god monster the size of a mountain or moon .
I imagine it has the energy of a small star stored in it .
Mangled_Wings :
This serves to illustrate the depth and energy of my hate for a setting where C might be more intimidating than I am .
Heart_Shaped_Pupil :
I think I might agree with you on the hate thing .
I want to meet face to face and hang out with S and you and maybe C and definitely Cap and R.
I want that to work out .

Subject : PHO Technical Assistance

After discussion among the moderation team , we have agreed to allow the name change .
As we discussed in the tech help chat , our primary concern in these situations is an abuse of the system or a lack of accountability .
This being said , your account is in good standing and you ’ve agreed to a probationary status .
Your in - account email , curated lists , private messages , badges , and accesses will remain intact , as will your forum account ’s connection to your wiki contributions .
Let us know if there is anything else we can help you with . 

Graham at PHO Subject : Re : PHO Technical Assistance 
 August 24th , Y1 

Thank you so much !
I am having another problem .
I ’ve been getting caught up on my PMs / DMs / Emails and there is a lot of abusive content .
All of the recent messages are very hostile or vulgar .
It seems to have started before I even signed back on .
I do n’t know why .
I ’m so sorry to raise problems when I ’m probationary .
Subject : Re : Re : PHO Technical Assistance 
 August 24th , Y1 
 Graham here .
I looked at the incident log and found one major incident that another site admin handled .
An article came out here .
Two groups online identified the people in that article and shared out their screen names and other information .
We took action when people used PHO resources ( direct messages , email ) to harass one of the individuals in the article .
We took action and removed them , but they may be returning with the use of new accounts and expanding the number of people targeted .
If you could report any or all of those involved , it would help us a great deal .
For solutions , I can think of three options : you can continue to report so we can continue to take action ( as these are not the people we want on PHO ) and we can hope this quiets down , you can move to a new account and start fresh , or you can agree to give PHO staff access to your private messages so we can take action .
This would involve us reading anything private in the conversations , and it would mean anyone messaging you was notified that PHO staff can read your things .
We would limit this to only recent and new senders , so your friends and pre - existnig conversation partners would stay private .
As a bonus the notification could help stem the influx .

Topic : [ Article ] Weld to Warden 

In : Boards ► News ► Events ► Gimel .
US 

Ball - Chan 

Posted on August 23rd
Y1 :
[ Article Text , Editorial]His list of credentials starts off good .
A two year tenure as a member of the Boston Wards with no offenses or misconduct reported to the media .
He was the third monstrous cape to feature as an actor on a television show , the first to make a second appearance on TV , and the first monstrous cape with an onscreen kiss .
He was the subject of a viral online image , released with various humorous captions , and it was a combination of this and arguably his small - network television appearances that gave him his popularity .
He rode this success to a position as the first monstrous cape to be the team leader of the Wards .
Ambitious fellow , is n’t he ?
Weld
’s popularity and time in the spotlight made him a figure of interest when , following undisclosed events in Brockton Bay , he turned from the established heroes and brought the vast majority of the monstrous capes in the Protectorate and Wards with him .
Speculation flew as to why , and Weld was cagey when asked .
No comment , the teenager said .
Weld ’s team was dubbed ‘ The Irregulars’ in a play on the term for unconventional military squadrons and on the team being wholly made up of monstrous capes .
At this stage , it was still possible to praise Weld for his efforts .
He reached out to monstrous parahumans both American and international , and he kept his team together while carrying out deeds for the camera .
Maintaining a group of such size is n’t an easy task when its numbers are swelling like his group ’s did .
He was n’t too open about his methods or his team ’s motivations .
Things take an ugly turn from here .
When Chevalier announced that the PRT was mending its ways and that the person at the heart of the organization ’s corruption had been defeated , Weld ’s irregular team of monstrous capes kept away and kept silent .
Heroes called for unity , the Suits answered that call , sending many members to America to serve , following a schism of their own .
Even the defeat of Behemoth or the appearance of the new Endbringers did n’t serve to bring Weld back into the fold .
If anything , Weld seemed to note that his team ’s numbers were dropping .
He and the monstrous capes serving under him stopped making as many public appearances .
We do n’t know what he started doing at this time , but his team was still recruiting .
No comment , Weld said .
It ’s telling , too , that Weld ’s appearance changed .
He decorated himself with horns and scales .
To those with an eye for the symbolic , Weld was a monstrous cape who was embracing the monster and turning his back on the cape side of things .
More time passed , and more silence followed .
No comment , he said , on the rare occasions when he appeared in front of the cameras .
No comment .
On that Thursday , June 20th , 2013 , Scion took our world from us .
He took almost everything from us .
Based on our limited accounts of what happened , Weld was there for the initial foray , an organized series of attacks mounted from an oil rig .
He was not there after , leading a substantial portion of his team to other venues .
There ’s no indication of what he was doing , but we do know he was n’t there for the skirmishes on other worlds , against other major organized groups of parahumans .
We do know he was n’t there for the follow - up confrontation on the beachhead .
Many will argue it was a chaotic time .
No reports are wholly accurate , the world was ending , and the number of parahumans fighting was no doubt mind - boggling .
Why make a point of this in particular ?
To start with , today was the day Weld returned to Gimel after some time elsewhere .
We ’ve been told he was doing a combination of work in Earth Bet and spending some time touring other worlds in the company of the mass - murderer codenamed ‘ Garotte’ and a pair of unnamed capes the two were friendly with .
He was extended an offer to join the Wardens as a leader of one of the group ’s cells , and he accepted .
People are applauding , it seems .
Weld led a rather formidable team of monstrous capes away from the field of battle , at that critical point in our recent history .
He came back practically alone , his team gone .
He ’s tight - lipped as to why .
His Wards team did n’t do very well either , for the record .
We have n’t heard the full story from him there either .
He claimed that he did n’t want to disparage his former employer , and that they were still on positive terms .
Does he deserve the position ? 

Is he trustworthy ? 

Is he even that good of a cape or a leader ?
I ’ll remind you of two of his favorite words , while you mull over those questions .

Nobody is saying why things happened like they did .
Some are hinting @
it tho . 

A lot are hinting at it .
Conspiracy of silence . 

Weld seems to know things and like the article says he ’s keeping his mouth shut . 

It is his right to keep quiet .
It is our right to say he ’s an asshole for doing it .

Guys guys guys .
this is a hit piece
and it ’s a bad one at that .
Full disclosure :
I know Weld some .
he was and is one of my favorite people But come the fuck on .
Everyone has a motivation driving them .
skimming through the comments on this article makes that v. clear .
YES absolutely wonder at weld
’s motivations .
wonder about everyone ’s .
wonder about the people who are pushing hard for moving forward and about the people who want to go back to the way things were .
wonder about the person who wrote this article and why he has the focus he does .
but do n’t make the mistake of focusing so much on the question marks that you forget about the other punctuation marks & if someone shows you who they are then believe them .
Weld ’s teammates in Boston and Brockton Bay only had nice things to say about him .
Period .
Weld did charity work with kids
he definitely did n’t have to do .
Period .
Weld served as team leader for a city in need and he kept his wards alive thru the Slaughterhouse Nine and God knows what else- exclamation mark .
Weld has never shown himself to be anything but decent .
if you ’re filling in the blanks or raising questions then take your cue from that first & foremost .

Silence is n’t an option .
Things are heating up , people are scared and we ’re scared for a justifiable reason .
Powers came out , and we started seeing broken powers .
People with mutations , people with no off switch .
Monsters who needed to be quarantined .
Endbringers .
Now we ’ve got a different kind of broken power .
It keeps getting worse .
It gets worse in a linear and steady way .
These things follow from one another .
There is a visible pattern and there is a sense to be made of things .
The new broken powers follow from the people made monstrous by their powers .
If Weld knows something we have to ask .
We have no authorities .
We have no system of government .
We have no national cape team or licensed heroes .
We ca n’t even agree on a name for Gimel ’s megalopolis !
We can discuss all day but at some point we need to make decisions .
We need to say we deserve to know
and if you wo n’t tell us then
no you ca n’t represent us
and no we wo n’t trust you to have our back .

 @
Capricorn –
I think you have some bias you ’re not admitting to here .
You disappeared too , did n’t you ?
You left Reach and disappeared .
A couple of your old teammates are saying they ’re thinking about joining the Attendant
and you ’re not included in that .
Why ?
Are we supposed to use your metrics to evaluate you ?
Go by the face you presented to the public ?
I think I ’d rather read between the lines .

1000000000s of human beings died or have yet to make their way to us .
1000000000s .
1000000000s of humans with families .
mothers and fathers .
good days and bad days .
i say 1000000000s instead of billions because billions barely sounds different from millions
and i think the zeroes drive it home the city is as big as it is because we were lucky .
we only lost about half of those close to us in N.E. US .
refugees of Earth Shin say a parahuman took over their Earth a decade ago .
one woman .
she went back home to continue ruling them .
there is a world not far from us which is at constant war .
there are tears in reality they can use to reach us and they have a lot of incentive to do so .
they have parahumans too .
there is a theocratic state which is more distant but they have some parahumans too .
there is a world of monsters like Weld and his irregulars .
there are others , smaller .
there are probably others who we have n’t been told about .
every week we get a handful of reports of people triggering with broken powers .
They burn bright and burn fast and they do a lot of damage .
on the smallest level we are quiet and still because we are afraid to disturb the peace .
but on the big level our new neighbors are n’t focused 100 % on us .
we ’re important .
we ’re a powerful few even though we lost 1000000000s .
the tyrant queen is looking at us but also watching over her shoulder for the war world and the monsters and the broken triggers .
the war world is wanting to venture out but maybe an expedition is hard to field and they get broken triggers too .
they ’re getting more regular triggers .
the truce will break , both on the small level and the big we are hurting from the loss of 1,000,000,000s
and we are only just now reaching the point where we need to make decisions .
what do we call ourselves ?
what direction do we go ?
Do we move forward or backward ?
Like i said we are smaller in number than we should be .
we ’re hurting .
we ’re distracted and scattered .
but i think we have the most powers at our disposal .
that ’s important .
and i think we ’re best equipped to have the answers when others come asking .
i think that ’s the most important thing by far .
they are going to ask and we are going to want to have answers to offer them
i think we need people to start telling instead of hinting .
information is the most valuable resource at all .

Information is also more volatile than oil , nitro , or nuclear material .
Look at the secret identity leaks going on in this thread .
Targeted harassment of Weld & others .
If hundreds or thousands agree to keep quiet about things then maybe there ’s a reason .

Humanity has seen its worst test yet and it came out the other side .
I ’d like to draw a comparison .
I ’ve read some of these pages
and I see an effort to make us out to be the enemy .
the monstrous capes are this mysterious thing and some of us are made out to know things that we are n’t saying I can tell you who we are .
just like you
we ’re scarred .
we were hurt very badly and altered very dramatically and we did n’t get to know why .
we desperately wanted answers because our histories friends and families were taken from us .
we were forced out of our homes and thrust into a strange place and many of us were left desperate or dangerous .
Just like some of you .
We learned some partial truths and that made things worse .
Then after a very long time and a lot of pain we learned most of the rest of the truth .
I wo n’t pretend its easy .
I struggled every day
and then I struggled more after the end of the world .
But we fought a hard fight whether it was to save the world or to get to safety or to climb out of dark angry depths .
We came out the other side .
Every day we survive is a day we can say “
I was THAT strong
so I can definitely survive this .
”
Replace I with WE because we are all together in this .
I do n’t know if that will work for you
but it helped me

Y1 :
I would like to thank you all for reading this .
I was invited to post here by Quasi after I posted in some other places .
Quasi has been talking to me and resurring me .
I remember hearing about the monster heroes and I never payed much attention to them .
Now I think I am one .
My name is Casey Forks
and I would be starting high school this fall if things had n’t gone bad .
My mom has n’t been well for a long time and my brother has the same condition so we decided to stick it out and whether things .
we had a shelter and we had some food .
my dad and I went to stores and raided them for more foods that would last
and we stocked up .
The shelter did n’t work out .
we all got headaches and dad said the air filters were n’t sufficent .
we went upstairs into the house and sealed all the gaps and dad tried to fix up the filters .
long story short that did n’t work out either .
I should have tried to get somewhere safe
but I stayed .
I should n’t have stayed .
I did n’t think enough about monster capes or about those with powers
but now I am both .
Maybe I am not Casey anymore .
I am frozen like the dead people who have lying on the ground for the years since the world ended , like a mummy without bandages .
Mold grows on me and grows around me and it covers everything I can see and think about .
I am a god of death and decay and I am an open fridge door with mold growing inside it and spilling out .
with every passing day and hour and minute I am less like casesy and more a god of gross fridge stuff .
my world of mold gets bigger every moment
I grew mold on my dads body and I could make him move .
I grew mold on his brain
and I got him to think
and with his thinking I finally got the generator and the router and the phones working .
It helped that I grew mold on the pieces and parts .
Now I am making my sister type because I can not move any part of me a milimeter
and I am asking heroes for help .
I ’m internet famous and there are articles written about my situation so that gives me some hope
But more importantly I am trying not to lose my mind .
Quasi is helping me with that
and he said you would all help by sharing your stories .
I am so scared that the heroes wo n’t save me
but I am just as scared they ’ll save me
but they wo n’t be able to fix me .
I am scared that I wo n’t be able to move .
I am scared I wo n’t be able to hug a pretty girl or lie next to her in bed .
I never cared about the rude stuff that much
I thought that the cuddling would be the nicest part .
I want to see the world through eyes that are n’t moldy and to take a deep breath and scream or even laugh .
I want to play soccer again with all my friends there
and I want my parents to be there and be proud .
Tell me I ’ll be ok .

Be strong brother .
With powers all things are possible .
Through trauma and struggle we find ourselves so much stronger .
It takes time to adjust and it takes time and effort to find the right keys to the right locks .
With help ( and you have so much help ! )
Clocks can be turned back and flesh can be reshaped .
We killed a god and the worst is behind us .
Slowly but surely we will put the pieces back together .
If I did not believe this 100 % then I would not be here to write this message to you .
Be strong .

I read some of your old posts Casey .
when you fractured your ankle playing soccer you were worried you would never play again but you got there .
When powers are involved the lows are so much lower but the highs are high enough to make it all so very worth it .
You are funny , smart and cool and people would n’t be rooting for you if you were n’t .
Your fears echo mine when I realized what had happened to me .
I worried I would never have control or have a boy next to me or anything else .
I can tell you it is possible .

Whippersnap :
I saw you in the casey thread .
you had your name changed but you did a bad job of covering up the change .
Space_Squid :
I did n’t cover it up .
The old name was a lark at a time I needed to laugh
but I ’m done with it .
Its embarrassing now 
  Whippersnap : some of us were talking in the chat and we agree you were n’t an ally in the end .
Space_Squid :
I see Whippersnap :
Egg was only one to come back from there .
he said you and Weld stopped us from getting justice Space_Squid : the messages I got .
They were n’t from angry civilians .
They were from you ?
Whippersnap : from us .
Space_Squid :
okay .
no need to worry then .
I wo n’t come back .
I wish you all the best .
Whippersnap : fuck you Space_Squid :
You should know I killed her .
The one who did this .
Whippersnap :
you stopped us from getting our justice and took it for yourself .
Space_Squid :
I guess so You have left the conversation .

Everything fine tuned .
Saw the worlds .
Spent time with my favorite person .
Cap : speaking of Kraken_in_a_Jar :
it ’s ok .
he ’s tough . 

Kraken_in_a_Jar :
thank you for rooting for him . 

Kraken_in_a_Jar :
it meant a lot to see your name there . 

Kraken_in_a_Jar :
I see the anger and the agitation
and I think really people are not complaining about what they are complainng about .
Cap : How is Weld doing ?
Kraken_in_a_Jar :
He s good .
Hard to tell sometimes because he is so strong .
Emotionally .
He busy but good .
New position means a lot even if I ca n’t go with him .
Heart_Shaped_Pupil :
You ’re with us
Kraken_in_a_Jar :
Absolutely Cap : things are stirring .
world is about to shift .
we ride the wave .
Weird_Insect :
we have work to do first .
organization to do .
things to figure out .
Cap : ( he ’s so different online )

Kraken_in_a_Jar :
did I miss much ?
of5
: someone put a hit out on me .
that ’s fun Kraken_in_a_Jar : ! ?

It ’s no big deal .
Nothing is happening just yet .
You ’ve been gone 5 days ?

see if we ca n’t top your boat trip .
Kraken_in_a_Jar :
you did n’t make any major decisions ?

No . we wanted to wait for everyone .
Cap saw you online and figured it was you .
he got ahold of R

we can support one another and hold each other up because of that .
but we have commonalities .
A and me .
K and me .
K and C. R and B. Weird_Insect : T&A.

Weird_Insect : … rest of you do n’t laugh too much or I am going to quit Kraken_in_a_Jar : we ’re doing this because we work together .
of5 :
It ’s been weird not having you around , s.
I think the balance is defintely something we need to keep an eye on Kraken_in_a_Jar
: Balance 100 % . 

Kraken_in_a_Jar :
we represent the lead we want others to follow 
 Kraken_in_a_Jar :

Kraken_in_a_Jar : strength Mangled_Wings :
Absolutely . Kraken_in_a_Jar : cooperation of5
: Yep Kraken_in_a_Jar : and honesty and good health and kindness and moving forward and all of that junk .
I feel really awkward now because people keep saying yes and now there are expectations and I feel like there ’s an order to it .
Weird_Insect : all that junk , yes .
Heart_Shaped_Pupil :
Do n’t feel awkward !
no expectations .
Well , some .
but is good .
we should have you be leader for this project and do the speeches .
Kraken_in_a_Jar :
I am not a leader .
Let me think on the speeches 
 Kraken_in_a_Jar :
and I ’m really tired of pulling on these knobs especially after all the travel .
I think I ’m going to get myself free and find another .
Weird_Insect : nobody say it Heart_Shaped_Pupil : another knob ? ! ! !
Weird_Insect :
damn it , K Kraken_in_a_Jar :
He ’s definitely not a knob 

Kraken_in_a_Jar :
I ’ll probably see you all online at some point .

Soon .

Hi .
I think we talked a few times a while ago
and I wanted to ask something 

Anonymous [ Old Message ] :
I ’m not sure
if I ’m
DMing the right person or if I got punctuation wrong .
Last time we talked was was years ago when you did the photoshoot . 

Anonymous [ Old Message ]
: I feel really lost .
I have questions
but I do n’t know who to ask .
I thought of you
and I hope I ’m not bothering you or getting the wrong person .
I really need some advice or perspective 

Anonymous [ Old Message ] :
I sent message anonymously
so if I ’m wrong or if I ’m bothering you
you can refuse Point_Me_@_The_Sky : That ’s me .
I barely remember the photoshoot .
That was a busy time for me . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : Sorry for late reply .
I had work to do for coming semester .
If you need advice I can try to give it-
I will say that I keep putting myself in a position to give advice
and I may not be the best person to give it .

Can you make a regular account and message me ?

  FlippinMad :
Hi .
Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
Hi .
How can I help ?
FlippinMad
: Thank you 

FlippinMad : I ’ve been thinking about things for a long time and I ’ve been digging for info and answers and trying to put it all together .
Is hard because people do n’t want to talk about things and a lot of people do n’t want to talk to me in particular .
People get upset
Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
The world ended .
It ’s kind of upsetting
FlippinMad
: I know .
I know 

FlippinMad : you were there ?
Point_Me_@_The_Sky
: We were all there toward the end .
Very few exceptions .
FlippinMad : thousands of capes were there and nobody wants to talk about the specifics Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
The answer will come out in time .
It may already be out there in places .
Communication is limited .
Pockets of humanity are spread out and the people who have a say in info getting from city A to city B are probably wanting to keep things peaceful for now .
Gov’t or what we have that passes for gov’t , PHO and the 12ish other online bodies
… 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : they control info .
But they ca n’t stop word of mouth .
Not easily .
We will hear the full story one day .
I do n’t know if it will be a good day
but we will hear it .
FlippinMad :
Ok 

FlippinMad : I ’m stressing about it
so I ’m not
sure if I can wait 

FlippinMad
: Can I ask questions and you can decide if you want to say or not ?
Point_Me_@_The_Sky : you can ask .
I ca n’t promise any answers .
FlippinMad
: Thank you 
 FlippinMad : Did you know Skitter ?
Weaver I guess Point_Me_@_The_Sky : I did n’t know her .
Not really 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
We crossed paths .
FlippinMad
: She ’s one of the people I ask people about and they get mad or defensive .
Or they tell me they have something to do and never get back to me Point_Me_@_The_Sky
: Yep .
FlippinMad :
Why ?
Point_Me_@_The_Sky
: Short answer :
I can’t
/ won’t say
FlippinMad
: Okay Point_Me_@_The_Sky : Longer answer : I do n’t know how things unfolded , but I think people fall into types and categories .
I do n’t know enough to say one way or the other
but I think she was looking for something .
FlippinMad
: I do n’t know if I understand Point_Me_@_The_Sky : You ’ve seen the video stuff ? 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : She hurt someone you know ?
FlippinMad
: I tried to find everything I could get .
I ’ve seen the cell phone movie from the cafeteria .
I saw a few .
not just the big one that was on the news .
Then I went back to find other news and footage .
Then I followed along 

FlippinMad :
Her joining the heroes and later with her talking to schoolkids but there was n’t much good video with that second one .
I saw the movie of her in New Delhi
and I saw her on TV here and there . 

FlippinMad
: She hurt people I care about
I guess .
That ’s not
why I ’m
asking Point_Me_@_The_Sky : I ’ve seen the same .
I saw her as the novice warlord 
 Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
She hurt an awful lot of people .
A crazy lot . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky
: She killed one of our best heroes 
 Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
She also joined the Levi fight .
She apparently helped against the S9 .
She joined the Wards 
 Point_Me_@_The_Sky : It ’s hard to reconcile
FlippinMad
: That ’s my problem 

FlippinMad
: I want to figure it out
but there are gaps
Point_Me_@_The_Sky : I do n’t have the answers for you .
I can only theorize 
 Point_Me_@_The_Sky :  
I read a thread on PHO a few days ago and it made me think .
I said I think she ’s someone who was looking hard for an answer .
I think she was wounded and lost and for this reason & probably because of other factors she did a lot of damage while looking .
The people she was with .
Things being primed for everything to fall down .
Timing or bad luck .
Personality .
FlippinMad : Wounded Point_Me_@_The_Sky :  
I ’m looking at my history
and I ’m having trouble finding the thread 
 Point_Me_@_The_Sky :   there are people who are searching
I think and there are people who just are .
I think both can be good and both can be toxic .
Some people are searching because of something that pushed them .
A lot of capes just are .
Some are doing the pushing , instead .
And there ’s all sorts of types . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky :  
I do n’t know her nearly well enough to say which she was
but I do n’t think she stood still .
Or when she did stand still it was because she was on a precipice , looking for a push or for something to push .
But again I do n’t know her . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky :  
You would have to explain more about what you want to know for me to give you any more of an answer
FlippinMad
: I pushed her Point_Me_@_The_Sky : You pushed her ?
FlippinMad
: I really hope you do n’t block me or ignore me 

FlippinMad : I ’ll try to explain but give me a moment . 

FlippinMad
: Do you remember me ?
We met a few times
but I think the only time we had a conversation was before the Vice - Versa photoshoot .
There were six of us who were around the same age and the designers were taking a while .
Point_Me_@_The_Sky :  
I remember that .
A bunch of non - capes from around the city , dressed up as capes , some of us local capes in fancy dress .
Skitter was n’t a part of that , obviously .
FlippinMad :
Yeah .
I ’m starting back at the beginning 

FlippinMad
: They picked top athletes , valedictorians , bunch of others . 

FlippinMad : You were hanging out with us .
Shadow Stalker and the rest of us were joking around .
Point_Me_@_The_Sky : I remember now .
Emma ?
FlippinMad :
Her friend .
I ’m the short one .
It was her biggest shoot ever and she was super psyched .
I tagged along .
We were joking around and you were laughing with us and the staff were running around freaking out and trying to do last minute costume changes 

FlippinMad : You were in fancy clothes and you had one of those masks on a stick , and Clockblocker was nearby complaining about having to hold his mask up until Ageis ( sp ? ) got some ribbon and tied it to his head for him , which made the hairdresser freak out Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
Aegis 
 Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
They catered those nonalcoholic soda cocktails with layered colors .
We drank them like they were water 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : and
the one woman ’s eyes bugged out when she saw what the bill was .
I felt so sorry for her . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : We gave the staff so much grief .
FlippinMad :
But that was part of the fun 

FlippinMad :
Yeah .
It was like a dream , hanging out with heroes and cool people .
Everyone was so fancy , including my friend .
It was the one time in my life where I felt like I was one of the teens in one of those overly polished scenes in a teen movie where everyone looks so perfect 

FlippinMad : I was really really hoping that they were going to just pull me in as an extra 
 FlippinMad : Because one of the kids they ’d invited had backed out . 

FlippinMad
: But it did n’t look like it was going to happen
and I was having enough fun that I did n’t mind too much .
I said things and people laughed at it .
And everything was great until then Point_Me_@_The_Sky : I said something did n’t I ?
FlippinMad
: You called us a bunch of bitches Point_Me_@_The_Sky : That was it .
FlippinMad
: You said ‘ This was such a nice night and you c - words had to spoil it by being disgusting .
Come on.’ 

FlippinMad : and then you walked away and most of the heroes and heroines went with you or whatever .
Leaving just me and Emma and a couple of others . 

FlippinMad
: They 100 % went into … 

FlippinMad
: I do n’t know what you call it .
Defense mode .
They wanted to bring things back to center .
Normalize .
They were saying things like “ what ’s bugging her ?
We were n’t saying anything that bad ” 

FlippinMad :
And I was sitting there being quiet
and I remember thinking they were wrong .
we were kind of being bitches and we were kind of going too far when ragging on people who were n’t there .
Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
The disabled girl I think .
We were having to wait because they were having to adjust her costume to work around her back brace . 
 
FlippinMad :
Yeah . 

FlippinMad
: We said something loud enough for her to hear from the other end of the room and you spoke up and then you went to go hang with her
instead 
 FlippinMad
: The night did n’t seem as magical after all that .
I was really bothered .
Point_Me_@_The_Sky : I barely remember beyond that .
I did the photoshoot
and we tried to cheer the girl up .
It was mostly great
and I saw Emma a few times after that
and there were no problems
but we were n’t friendly
FlippinMad
: It was the first time in my life I stopped and took stock and asked myself “ am I a good person ?
”
Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
To an extent you get a pass .
To an extent .
We were 13 - 20 I think .
You were closer to 13 than 20 .
Teenagers are shitty and most teenagers make a couple of mistakes .
Not excusing it .
It sucked as a thing .
But teenagers being asshats mitigates it
FlippinMad :
No 

FlippinMad
: I was really fucking shitty . 

FlippinMad
: I think its worse because I had this wake up call
and I asked myself if I was a good person 

FlippinMad : Except I never got around to answering that question .
I kept putting it off and feeling shitty about it 

FlippinMad
: We kept being bitches .
And then a couple months after that we put Taylor in the hospital .
Skitter .
I do n’t know if she had powers then but if she did then I do n’t know why she did n’t murder us all Point_Me_@_The_Sky
: You ’re the bullies that pushed her over the edge
FlippinMad :
Me and Emma and our friend Sophia and Julia and a few others .
But we were the main three or four Point_Me_@_The_Sky : I feel dumb not connecting those dots before .
Preoccupied atm
and I was preoccupied then .
Fuck me .
Emma was one of them ?
They kept your names out of the media FlippinMad
: Word still got out . 

FlippinMad : So this is where I am because I almost feel responsible ?
Or I do n’t know
if I ’m responsible 

FlippinMad
: But we pushed her 

FlippinMad :
And after that she joined bad guys and robbed a bank 
 FlippinMad :
And then somewhere after that the empire got upset at her and her group and called them out before attacking the city and RIGHT after that the Endbringer attacked . 

FlippinMad
: There were all these theories about why it attacked Brockton Bay and the big two were that there was a holy grail or something ?
I did n’t follow that one .
They said it might have to do with why people wanted to control the city ?
Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
A target .
Something that would make the city valuable .
Or someone .
Endbringers have gone after specific people before FlippinMad :
Ok .
I do n’t know .
The other one was that the city saw so much fighting in a short time .
Taylor was a part of that
and I ’m part of what pushed her out there 

FlippinMad : I know I sound narcissistic and shit
but … Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
Are you gon na finish that sentence ?
FlippinMad
: I do n’t know .
I feel responsible 

FlippinMad
: I was pretty much there at the beginning
and I pushed her
and … 

FlippinMad
: it feels like I was at the top of a hill
and I pushed a rock down it
and it rolled down out of sight 

FlippinMad :
and then this rockslide starts further down the hill and wipes out a town and kills this really important person and a whole bunch of other horrible things . 

FlippinMad
: … and
I go looking and my rock is lying there in the devastation .
Nobody ’s saying what happened .
her wiki page is gone and people get annoyed or upset when I ask .
I want to know what happened when I could n’t see .
Every non - answer I get makes it worse
Point_Me_@_The_Sky : She was her own person .
She made her own decisions along the line .
FlippinMad
: I know that Point_Me_@_The_Sky : You do n’t own her .
You do n’t own every decision she made or the whole fallout 
 
FlippinMad : I know .
But I did n’t help matters .
Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
No .
You definitely own some of it .
FlippinMad :
And you ca n’t tell me what happened .
Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
I ca n’t & wo n’t .
But I guess I can say this . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : With the evidence we have we know she did some good things .
She did some bad things .
She did some incredibly controversial things .
She was more vicious and ruthless than she needed to be maybe .
FlippinMad
: Am I responsible for that extra viciousness and ruthlessness ?
Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
Ca n’t say .
Neither can you .
But it probably did n’t fill her with smiles and joy
did it ?
FlippinMad : I spat on her once .
It was Emma who really got to her and Sophia who went out of her way to hurt her .
I was … 

FlippinMad
: I put her backpack in the toilet once .
Books , notebooks and all .
The water was clear but it was still the toilet
and
yeah .
I put glue on her desk and juice on her seat
and I stood by when the others were doing the worst stuff .
Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
Fucking why ?
FlippinMad
: I do n’t know .
I never really stopped to think about it .
My friend was a model and my other friend was a top athlete .
Maybe I wanted to keep up .
I told myself it was prank tier stuff
but at the same time 

FlippinMad
: I ’m saying this because this is like I ’m confessing but like … 

FlippinMad : Some time between when that photoshoot happened and when we put her in the hospital we were talking .
Emma Sophia Julia and I.
We figured we were falling into a pattern
and we kept knocking her down when she picked herself up too much . 

FlippinMad :
and I had this moment where I saw she was really low
and I spat on her .
I remember the look on her face 

FlippinMad : what the hell was wrong with me ?
I did n’t wake up to what I was doing until I got fucking caught which is just so doubly shitty .
My parents found out when we all got called to school and that was the last time I interacted with Taylor .
Moved away with Leviathan . 

FlippinMad : I fucking spat on her face Point_Me_@_The_Sky : Stop now please
FlippinMad :
ok
Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
Ok . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : If you kept going I would ’ve closed this and left you to it .
Now I ’m going to try to give you your answer here .
Ok ? 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : Even though you probably do n’t deserve it .
FlippinMad :
Yeah Point_Me_@_The_Sky : Draw your own conclusions .
Look at who she was and extrapolate .
She did good
she did bad .
As time passed yes the bad things might have faded some but the controversial stuff she did might have gotten worse .
Extrapolate .
FlippinMad
: You ’re saying that ’s what happened ?
At the end .
She did some good and she did some bad
but she did something super controversial ?
Point_Me_@_The_Sky
: I am saying * nothing*. I am suggesting that if you are wondering what happened when you could n’t see then you can make some educated guesses . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
She killed people .
She hurt people .
She may have played a part in a war over the city .
She threatened innocents with bugs and choked more than one person to death or nearly to death by shoving spiders and centipedes down their throats .
She killed Alexandria at a time when we needed Alexandria most . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : She consorted with rapists terrorists and monsters . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
And because it eneds to be said
yes she became a hero .
That counts for something maybe .
Maybe she had to .
Maybe not . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : She was there at the end and whatever she did , nobody will speak of it , at least for now .
Fill in the blank 
 Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
Now she ’s gone and you ’re still here .
FlippinMad :
Gone ? 

FlippinMad : she retired ?
Or she ’s dead ?
Gone gone ?
Point_Me_@_The_Sky
: She is * gone*. 
 Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
But listen to me .
because you made the choices and you carried on when you could ’ve stopped and you spat on her
and I ’m not ignoring that .
I ’ve been holding back
so I can get to it now . 
 
FlippinMad : I ’m listening Point_Me_@_The_Sky
: She was all of those things
and she might have still been a better person than you 
 
FlippinMad : …
Point_Me_@_The_Sky : Feel shitty ?
Good .
Is it weighing on you or eating at you or making you wonder ?
Fucking good .
That ’s the way it should be . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : Carry it .
Own it .
Make allowances for the fact that you were a teenager but do n’t you dare excuse it or ignore it 
 Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
If owning it means you assume the worst case scenario ?
that you pushed her
and she took action and that line of action ended in the end of the world being uglier than they needed to be ?
Fine .
Make do . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : Maybe things would be better .
Maybe they would be worse .
Maybe someone else would have taken the same role .
Maybe we would all be dead .
You might not ever get a clean answer and that might be her justice against you
FlippinMad :
Yeah Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
All this I ’m saying ?
I feel like I can say it because I have my own regrets and misdeeds .
I ’m trying to own them just like
I ’m
telling you to .
I did n’t fucking spit on a girl when she was already having a bad day or make fun of a disabled girl on what should ’ve been one of the top ten days of her life
but I could probably make a priest
’s jaw drop if I were the type to visit a confessional 
 Point_Me_@_The_Sky
: I ’m not giving you advice I would n’t take myself 
 Point_Me_@_The_Sky
: Carry it .
Take it with you and use it as motivation to make things better .
We need a fucking lot of that motivation .
FlippinMad
: I ’m training to be a teacher Point_Me_@_The_Sky
: Then I hope 10x as much that you own this and learn from it 
 
FlippinMad :
Yeah 

FlippinMad
: That s kind of the plan .
I want to anyway
but the school turned me down .
Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
Anything else ?
FlippinMad : When do I get to put this behind me ?
When do I get forgiven or get to forgive myself ?
Point_Me_@_The_Sky
: You ’re asking me ?
Never . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky
: I do n’t believe in forgive & forget .
Not for the things I ’ve done .
not for what others have done to people I care about .
Not for what ’s been done to me . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
The moment we forget is the moment we allow those wrongs to be done again . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : Forgiveness is the easy way out .
Less to carry .
FlippinMad
: That does n’t seem fair Point_Me_@_The_Sky : Villains outnumbered the heroes .
Now heroes outnumber villains .
Allegedly .
People lost everything and they did n’t deserve to .
Some people get powers and some do n’t .
Things are the furthest thing from fair . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : Maybe it ’s not fair that she ’s gone and you ’re here . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : Maybe you will get the answer about what happened and you ’ll feel better and that ’ll be unfair because you should n’t . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : Maybe the opposite is true and no good answer will come out and she ’ll be forgotten without tombstone or anything else . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : I expect we ’ll get the answer and it ’ll be an unhappy compromise between the two FlippinMad :
It does n’t seem fair to yourself
I mean Point_Me_@_The_Sky : I ’ll handle me .
You handle you .
You focus on making sure no girl you teach gets spat on ,
short girl from the photoshoot . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
It ’s easy enough to keep something moving once it ’s already moving , but getting it going in the first place is hard .
That ’s the thing about second chances and fresh starts .
It ’s a ( re)start .
You got ta get things moving all over again , the second time around . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : Let ’s try to make sure things are moving in the right direction .
Alright ?
Deal ?
FlippinMad :
Alright . 

FlippinMad : Not quite the response
I expected Point_Me_@_The_Sky : I had the impression it ’s the response you were asking for FlippinMad : You might be right . 

FlippinMad : Thanks








Ward is the second work in the Parahumans series , and reading Worm first is strongly recommended .   
A lot of this wo n’t make sense otherwise and if you do find yourself a fan of the universe , the spoilers in Ward will affect the reading of the other work .
Ward is not recommended for young or sensitive readers .
⊙
It was a second chance for humanity as a whole , and they ’d gone and screwed it up from the start by coloring the city gold , of all colors .
The skyline was a half - and - half mix of skyscrapers and buildings in progress .  
The latter were skeletons of tall buildings in the process of being filled in and put together , and hazard signs , tarps , the materials that made up the countless cranes and the painted letters on steel girders were all in bright yellows .  
The completed skyscrapers were paneled with mirrored or reflective glass that were tinted in that same hue .  
All put together , the light that bounced off of the city and reached skyward gave the clouds linings that were gold , not silver .
It was such a fucking shame that it had to be the case , intentional or not .
My phone was buzzing with texts .  
I pulled it from my skirt pocket and looked while I walked .
Parental Unit 1 : 

BBQ tonight with everyone 

My house 

Can you come ?
I glanced around to make sure I was n’t going to walk into anyone , then stepped off the sidewalk , into a gap between two display windows that bowed out and forward .  
In front of me , an assortment of people walked .   
People in business clothes walked briskly , while some elderly people meandered .   
A whole herd of kids were hurrying off to school .
I typed out my reply .
Me : 

That ’s short notice Parental Unit 1 : 

Michael is swinging by 

There has been talk of everyone getting together . 

It seemed worth trying to arrange 
 If you ca n’t come
that ’s
ok I understand Me : 

If I did n’t come , would be because of work .
New semester & lots to do .
Might come very late Parental Unit 1 : 

Spur of moment thing that is almost pulled together 

Only missing you 

Not to guilt you ha ha Ha ha .  
She never liked using shorthand like ‘ lol’ .
No .  
No guilt at all , mom .
Parental Unit 1 : 

Come if you can 
 Will save you dessert just in case
My typed reply was interrupted by a crash .  
The stride of every person on the sidewalk in front of me and every person on the other side of the street was interrupted , as they stopped , heads turning .
I put the phone away , the message half finished .  
The impact had been at the nearest intersection , where a smaller road cut through one of the downtown areas .   
I had to push through the bystanders closest to the scene to get there , and I could hear the victim ’s wail of distress before I was halfway through .
A car accident .  
There were no injuries , and I could n’t see blood .  
Nothing suggested that anyone had died .  
Not that anyone would have guessed by the sounds the man was making .
A teenager stood outside her car , the front corner and passenger - side mirror trashed .  
She ’d hit one of the pillars that lined the street .
An older man was doubled over , but he was on the far side of the pillar , not a location that suggested he could have been hit .  
He was elderly , with gray hair that still had color in it .  
Two people had already drawn close to him , supporting him while he knelt , rocking slightly in place .  
The sound he made was the heartbroken , strained sound that people made when they could n’t even draw in a full breath .
Such shitty , shitty bad luck , that he ’d been here when the collision happened .
‘ Pillar’ was the wrong word , but the right word felt wrong .   
‘ Monument’ implied something huge , but it was barely taller than I was , maybe three feet across at the base , tapering to two feet across at the top .  
Plaques were recessed into three of the four faces – the fourth had come free and fallen after the collision .  
Each plaque bore an etching of a face , a name , a date of birth , a date of death , a message .
I looked down the length of the one - lane road .  
There were as many pillars as there were trees , and there were a lot of trees , enough that the sunlight that peeked past them was dappled .   
This pillar was one of what had to be over a thousand that had been set throughout the city by now , punctuating quaint streets and surrounding parks .  
Places that were nice .
They were part of an initiative by an independent cape , a hero turned rogue , helping out .
There could easily be a thousand more of these pillars before the year was over , that number repeated every year thereafter , and if that work continued for another fifty or a hundred years , there would n’t be a pillar for one percent of the people we ’d lost .  
Not even if ‘ we’ were just the people who hailed from the northeastern U.S ..
The girl who ’d been driving the car had a thousand - yard stare as she faced down the small crowd .  
She looked like she ’d just hit a real person and reality was sinking in .
The wailing stopped .   
People were consoling the old man , some shooting hard looks at the girl who did n’t seem to be registering much of anything .
“
Hey , ” I called out .
She did n’t seem to register that I was talking to her , as she stared at the lower portion of the pillar that had crumbled , stone chunks broken away , cracks webbing across the surface .
“
Are you okay ?
”
I asked her .
She nodded , said , “
I ’m so sorry .
”
The old man looked up at her .
People in the crowd were staring , apparently angry on the old man
’s behalf .   
One hapless teenager and thirty or forty very upset people .
“ Listen , ” I told her .   
“
Stay close by , okay ?  
I ’m sure someone in the crowd there is calling for help- ”
Someone in the crowd raised a hand to get my attention .  
They had a phone to their ear .
“
-They’re
calling for help .  
They ’ll be here shortly .  
Do n’t go anywhere , you can explain what happened , alright ?
”
That seemed to get through to her .  
She nodded again , retreating to her car , apparently to sit in the front seat .  
Good .  
That was handled .
Until she stopped at the door , turned around , and addressed the old man and the crowd , “ I ’m really goddamn
sorry
I broke your thing .
”
The grieving man rose to his feet , stepping forward at the same time .  
He pulled away from the supporting hands of the people around him , his face contorting .
I stepped in his way , my arm out .  
He pushed forward , and I caught him in a half - hug with one arm , stopping him .   
He reached out and tried to push me aside , and I caught his arm .
He was a guy , but he was an elderly guy .  
It was n’t much of a contest .   
The moment he met resistance , he sagged , and I did what I could to keep him from outright collapsing as he slowly sank to his knees again , sobbing openly .
I took the opportunity to turn him a fraction so he would n’t be looking at the girl or the pillar as he knelt there .
In the background , that girl seemed to flounder in shock , useless , not sure what to do with herself in the face of this moment of violent grief .   
She looked at me , but I did n’t want to say anything that might agitate the man I was dealing with .  
She looked to the crowd , and she saw only angry stares .
I was n’t sure what she ’d seen , if it was a motion from someone , a particular emotion on a particular face , but she found the reason to get moving again , getting into the car , slamming the door behind her .  
The man I was holding jumped at the sound .
The man stopped resisting altogether .   
It had been a fast enough change in attitude that I had to wonder at what he would have done if I had n’t intervened .  
Shouted in her face ?  
Grabbed her ?  
Would he have lashed out and struck the girl ?  
If he would ’ve gone so far as to use violence , would it have been relentless , requiring people to pull him off , or would he have stopped the moment he was interrupted ?
I gradually relaxed my hold on him .
The crowd , too , seemed to realize that the situation had mostly de - escalated .  
The girl was in her car , the old man was n’t an apparent danger to himself or others so long as I was here .  
That was enough for the assembled group to start breaking up .
I stepped back , hands partially raised in case he started forward again , and to enable me to act if he seemed like he might fall .  
I could n’t just say the pillar would get fixed , or that things would be okay .  
The old man had n’t shed tears for the pillar .
I did n’t want to say ‘ sorry’ , and echo the kid in the car .
I almost asked if there was anyone I could call .  
I stopped myself when I realized the answer could be no .
“
How about we get away from here ?
”
I asked , keeping my voice soft .   
“
We can go grab a coffee or tea , and you and I can talk .
”
The man looked at me , as if just now realizing there was a person right next to him .
“
It ’s got to be better than violence , ” I said .
“
I do n’t
–
I ’m not violent , ” he said , sounding very small .
The heads of the crowd turned in reaction to something outside my field of view , and the old man ’s head turned as well .
Behind me , it seemed .  
A man in costume .  
It was a good outfit , too , more in the dollars that had been put into it than in terms of looks , but that was personal opinion .  
Partial discs of metal seemed to intersect his body , forming a look where he looked like a blender caught mid - whirl , axe blades and metal rings jutting from his breastplate , armguards , leg armor , and even his face , with blades running along one brow and cheekbone to frame one eye .
There were heavier blades at his hands and feet , such that it looked like he should n’t be able to walk or even stand without difficulty .  
As it was , he had one end of his long - handled axe resting on the ground , the length of it bowing beneath his weight as he perched on it ,
one arm outstretched to one side , hand gripping the head .  
He was crouching on the thing while it rested at a diagonal , in a way that looked like he ’d wipe out if the end of the weapon lost traction on the roadtop .
Fuck me .  
Not what we needed right now .
The old man started to stand .   
I helped him .
“
Can I do anything to help ?
” he asked .
“ I do n’t think so , ” I said .   
“
Minor accident , we ’re just waiting for cops to come and assess things , take numbers .
” I was barely done speaking when someone in the crowd said , “ We do n’t need you .
”
I watched him glance over the small crowd , looking for the person who had spoken .  
He kept looking out for the speaker as he told us , “ There ’s some police on their way .  
With all the reconstruction and the lower priority , they ’re trying to get through the traffic right now .
”
“
That ’s good to know , ” I said .   
“ Thank you .
”
He nodded .  
He looked deeply disturbed by the one comment he ’d heard .  
I caught a glimpse of the emblem on his sleeve .  
A badge , not a personal symbol or icon , but part of the team he belonged to .   Advance Guard .  
They were a team with an agenda to push .  
The world had ended , and they were pushing hard for a better and different tomorrow .
I could respect that .
I could also cringe inwardly at the fact that our superhero here was implicitly sporting a ‘ move forward’ ideology when that was the last thing this old man probably wanted to hear with a freshly reopened emotional wound .   
Time and place .   
Unfortunately , because of the team emblem the cape had on his breast- a stylized figure holding a shield shaped like a greater - than symbol , the guy represented that ideology every time , in every place .
He walked over to the car , still watching the crowd , and he exchanged a few words with the girl in the driver ’s seat .   
I was glad for that , at least .   
I had my hands full with the old guy and nobody else was stepping up to do it .
The cape stepped away from the car , looked at me and the old man .   
“
He ’s okay ?
”
“ The pillar .   
It ’s for his-
”
I started , looking at the plate on the pillar for a clue .
“ Son .  
My son , ” the man said .
“ My condolences , ” the hero said .
The man tensed .   
They were words that made it worse , not better , somehow .
“
Go , ” someone in the crowd said .  
A different person than the last .   
“
We ’re fine .
”
The people that had been splintering away were holding position now .  
I could see the hostility .   
The summer heat was holding out through the start of September , making things just a little more uncomfortable , tempers a little shorter .
“
Yeah , ” the hero said , more to himself .
It put me in mind of a scene from the history books and the grainy old news footage of an event from the mid-80s .  
Back in the day , when the superheroes could be counted on the fingers of both hands , there had been a riot over a sports match .  
The anger and chaos had outweighed the respect the rioters had for the hero that had stepped in .  
Someone had struck out with a blunt object and hit the hero .   
He ’d died before he reached the hospital .   
We ’d called him the second cape after Scion , but he might well have been the first , after all .
Did I think that would happen here ?  
No .  
Too small a group , the emotions were different , there was n’t enough chaos .
Still , the general setpieces were here .  
The barely restrained emotion .  
The lack of care .  
The ill - timed intervention of the man in costume .  
The lack of respect in particular was in play .  
For Vikare , it had been because so many people had n’t truly believed the powers were real , and he had apparently held back to avoid scaring people .
For this cape from Advance Guard , it was the opposite .  
He ’d gone all out , we ’d gone all out .  
Capes still had n’t been able to stop the world from ending .
We were back at the beginning in so many ways .
“
Yeah , ” the hero said again .  
He seemed to wrestle with what he was going to say next before deciding on , “ I ’m going to go .
” I wanted there to be people in the crowd who spoke up .  
I wanted there to be other things besides this sentiment of hostility and rejection .  
For this guy and for all the rest of us .  
Were there any people who wanted to say something positive ?
Nobody .  
Or if there was anyone , they were afraid to speak out against the herd .  
I did n’t want to leave it like this .
“
Nice response time , ” I said .
He turned my way and raised an eyebrow .
“ You showed up quick .  
It was impressive .
”
He nodded , studying me as if trying to find the catch .   
“
It ’s what I do .
”
I wanted to say something more , but I did n’t want to push my luck .  
It would have been nice if he ’d been less dismissive when I was throwing him a bone .
“
Take care , ” he said .   
“ Cops are on their way .  
I ’ll go let them know what ’s up .
”
“ Thanks , ” I said .   
“
You take care too .
”
He stepped down from the pole of his battleaxe and set foot on the road .   
Pavement splashed as if he ’d stepped in a puddle .  
More splashed and rippled as he moved his axe in a circle around him .
When he took a step and moved , it was faster than I could track .  
I could see the splash that followed behind , a cresting wave that quickly settled , leaving only a faint wavy pattern in the road as it dissipated .
I ’d spoken against the herd .  
I tried not to pay too much attention to them or give them any excuse to push back against me , instead turning my attention to the old man .
“
I ’m offering tea or coffee , my treat .  
We can talk it out , or talk about something else entirely , ”
I told him .   
“ As soon as the police are done .
”
He still looked like he was carrying that fresh pain , in expression and posture .  
He flinched some as he looked at his son ’s memorial pillar .  
He gave the girl in the car a hard look , then seemed to let the anger out , sagging .
She was in the driver ’s seat , both hands and forehead on the wheel .
“
No , ” he said .   
“
You ’ll have some place to be .  
I should n’t keep you more than I have .  
I ’ll be fine .
”
“ Work , ” I said .   
“
They would n’t fire me , especially if I explained .  
I ’d get in trouble , maybe , but I would n’t mind much .  
Job is … a seven out of ten fit .
”
“
Seventy percent is a lot better than some are getting , ” the man said .   
“
Keep that job .  
I ’ll manage now .
”
I glanced at the girl in the car .  
She had barely moved .
“
You ’ll leave her alone ?
” I asked .
The old man heaved out a sigh .
“
She ’s a kid who made a stupid mistake , ”
I said , in case he was trying to come to a decision .   
“ You do n’t have to forgive her , but you ca n’t go and hurt her or anything .
”
“ I would n’t have …
” he said , and he did n’t finish the sentence .  
Because he might have , or because he did n’t know what he would n’t have done .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
That ’s good .
”
“ Go .  
Work .  
Do n’t let me keep you , ” he said .   
“
I ’ll be straight with the police there .
”
“ I ’ll stick around for the cops and then duck out .
”
The police cars had appeared at the edge of the block , but with traffic on the narrow road slowed by the girl ’s car , they ’d stopped there .  
The cars could n’t progress , but the police were getting out .
One officer went to talk to the girl , another to the old man .  
I waited around a minute , then gave a statement and my info .
As in most things having to do with law or bureaucracy , it took longer than it should have , for a relatively simple process .  
I hurried to the high school once they were done with me , and I arrived rather late .
High school .
We still were n’t at the point where we had nice lawns and yards .  
This schoolyard was no exception .  
We had grass and fields , yes , but it was coarse and the ground beneath was n’t usually landscaped .  
The area was large with large trees left untouched in the corners , chain link fence separating the field from the roads on two sides , the grade school formed the third boundary to the west , and the high school formed the fourth boundary to the north .  
The ground was uneven , more hilly than flat , and there were still large stones here and there , and a seemingly out of place play structure for the grade schoolers .
It was an odd thing .   
So often , nature was transplanted into a city , and it was new and inauthentic , made overly neat .   
Trees , lawns , flowers .   
Here , the nature was rough and unpolished , the city itself new and somewhat artificial in how overly tidy it was , untouched by time or elements .
A sports field in the middle section separated the grade schoolers’ area from the theater .  
It was a stage in the old Roman style , slabs of stone set into the ground like stairs , stepping down as they got closer to the stage , where the platform sat .
Hundreds of students had gathered on the stone seats , and more stood around the top edge of the theater , watching and listening .   
They were our survivors , our next generation .   
Not so different from the crowd I ’d had to deflect earlier .   
A third of them still wore the very simple clothes that were handed out with supplies in the tent cities .   
Some had even taken to strategically ripping and dressing up those clothes .   
I did n’t fault them for it .   
It was hot .
A speaker carried the voice to those of us on the top edge .
The teachers of the school were on the stage , but they were n’t speaking .  
It was a series of community leaders and volunteers instead .
“ …
And I make that a guarantee to you , ” a man in an orange vest was saying .
“ If you take those credentials , bring good shoes and work clothes , and if you do n’t screw around , you can walk into any lot and you can be working within the hour and get your pay by that day ’s end .  
Good pay .  
You can do whatever you want , after school , but you ’ll always have this as a fallback , you ’ll have the security of being able to walk into a lot and have a job waiting for you .  
We can always use more hands .
”
Not enough seats at this school either .  
High school was and might well continue to be a half - day thing .  
The people on the stage were telling the kids their other options for the other half of the day .
I spotted Gilpatrick on the stage .  
He wore a black t - shirt and gray pants with boots , and in the summer heat he was sweating a fair amount .  
He had no hair on his head , but he had a five o’clock shadow well before five o’clock , bushy eyebrows and thick hair on thick forearms .  
Everyone else looked like they were trying to make their best pitch , in dressing nice and wearing smiles .  
Gilpatrick looked like he was trying to scare his prospects away .
Some of the non - prospects were standing around the upper edge , looking down at the new students and the stage .  
Most were senior students who ’d picked what they ’d do with their half - days last year , now waiting to induct the others .  
Some were siblings of those seniors , or younger friends .  
Others were like me , miscellaneous staff for miscellaneous roles .
I joined them .
“
We wondered if you ’d bailed , ” Jasper said .  
He was very much a teenager , with acne , thin chin - hair and black hair that had had product in it , that had turned spiky from sweat .
“ Delayed by a car accident .
”
“
Everyone ’s okay ?
” he asked .
“ Yep .
”   
Insofar as anyone is okay .   
“
Has Gil done his five pounds of gun thing ?   
I was kind of looking forward to it , it ’s so corny .
”
“ I think he ’s saving it for the deeper explanation later .  
He mostly talked about how he was going to make it his objective to make people quit , he is n’t going to pay anyone , job prospects suck , he ’s going to make people march in the heat and the cold for miles while carrying unreasonable burdens .  
The ‘ five pounds’ speech is n’t bad , you know .  
It gets through to the kids , ” Jasper said .  
For all that he was defending the speech , he smirked a bit .
“
It gets through to most , ” Cubs said .  
He was a big guy , tall , broad - shouldered , fit , with his hair cut short .  
He thought for a second and then amended his statement , “ some .
”
“
Us , ” Jasper said .
“
Guess
so , yeah , ” Cubs said .
I did n’t miss the glance he shot at the girl at the far end of our little sub - group .  
Cami wore an expression I might have termed ‘ resting angry face’ .   
Perpetually pissed .
All three of them , and many other members of the group besides , were dressed in similar shades as Gilpatrick .   
Blacks and grays .
“
I ’m going to duck into my office , ” I said .   
“ I want to check my email and make sure it ’s nice and neat if anyone stops in .
”
“ Only a short bit before we migrate over , ” Cubs said .
“ One more speaker .
”
“ I ’ll let Gilpatrick know you ’re there , ” Jasper said .  
He extended a fist .  
I rolled my eyes and instead of tapping it with my own , pushed it away .   
Jasper smiled .
My destination was n’t in the high school , but was across the street .  
It was an open building with a partial second floor .  
The main floor was hardwood , with mats folded and piled up at the side .  
A few more senior students were already there-
some were just entering or leaving the showers .  
It seemed like a good idea for cooling down , but I did n’t have the time .
I waved at some of the seniors in passing and headed up the stairs .   
The stairwell ran up one wall , unbounded by barriers , so it offered a view of everything below .
My office was the closest thing I had to a home , in this world .  
It was narrow and long , with a bookshelf at the right wall , a desk , computer and chair .  
Some boxes were piled up in the corners .
The bookshelf was my accomplishment .  
My fingers ran along the spines of books and other texts .  
Many of the works were collections of articles or official documents , bound by hand with a three - hole punch , rings , and patience .
Parahuman science .  
University textbooks , old workbooks with notes- not all mine .  
There were important articles , copied to plain text and printed out , with a lean toward the sciences , the nuances , the big revelations and reveals .
Official files .   
Classification documents .   
Then there were the notes for case one , case fifteen , case thirty - two , case fifty - three , case ninety .   
The ‘ cases’ were the events the PRT had deemed of interest .   
Riddles both solved and unsolved .   
My collection there was incomplete , but some were official enough to be confidential , and I ’d never had that access .   
Others were closed , the mystery deemed nonexistent or something to be folded into popular knowledge .
I had other files .  
There were names on those files .  
Whittler , Bilious , King Crow were some of the many on the shelf I ’d deemed ‘ independents’ .  
For teams , there were ones like the Ambassadors , Green Tea , N.N. , Ossuary , Empire Eighty - Eight , and the Clans .   
I ’d made it a priority to collect those .   
I worried we might need them .
On the bottom shelf , I had my magazines .  
Costumes Under Clothes , Gleam , Heroines , Masque ,
Shine On .  
Some of the boxes in the corner had my latest haul .  
Much of it would be duplicates .  
Maybe I ’d give some of them out to seniors .
I could still smell a faint mildewy smell , and promised myself I ’d identify the source when I had time .  
I ’d left the window open , and the weather was warm , which was helping .  
A lot of this was what I ’d salvaged from the office back home ; I ’d retrieved it from boxes and filing cabinets and hauled it here over a dozen trips .  
I ’d rigged up tarps to keep the water off that corner of the house , but some of that moisture had been coming up from below .  
I would have to find the source of the smell and transcribe the text before throwing it out .
Maybe I could get Gilpatrick to get a kid who needed punishing to do it for me .
Information was too important .  
Even if that information was from the glossy , superficial magazines about superheroines that had been pitched to girls just like me eight to ten years ago .
Faint smells aside , I could draw in a deep breath and feel muscles from shoulder to calf relax .   
This was more of that seventy percent part of the seventy percent fit where the job suited me .
That thirty percent , though .  
I would n’t stay here forever .  
I hoped .  
It had been a thing that I ’d hoped would look good on my college applications .   
That had n’t worked .
I could hear the commotion as the mob of kids started coming in downstairs .
I walked over to my computer and booted it up .  
It booted up instantly , but the connection to the internet took a while .  
I opened a notebook and began searching through it .
I found the name before the internet succeeded in connecting .  
I closed the conversation from the day prior and waited for the internet before composing an email .

Subject :
Damaged pillar 

I was a bystander when a car crashed into a pillar on Small St , near Basil Ave .  
Thought
I ’d let you know it ’s damaged .  
Let me know
if there ’s anything I can do to help or any info I can provide .
Thanks for what you do .
I sent it , then stood , walking to the window .  
I did n’t have much of a view- mostly the side of a building and a bit of the alley .  
If I stuck my head out the window , I could see a sliver of the school and some of the street .   
Students were milling around , some undecided on where they were going .
My computer chimed .

Subject : Re : Damaged Pillar 
 I already heard .  
Advance Guard were on the scene and let me know .  
Will have it fixed tomorrow .  
Thanks .
That would be fixed soon then .  
I thought the things were an eyesore , really , but people clearly felt like they were important .
I was caught up in checking recent events online when there was a knock on the door .
Gilpatrick .
“ Should n’t you be handing out guns to kids ?
” I asked .   
“ Or giving a hard - assed speech that sends them running ?
”
“ I wish , ” he said .   
“
Ca n’t give them guns until later .   
Give me a week , we ’ll see how many of them
I can get rid of .  
Can you show your face downstairs for me , so they know who to look for ?
”
“
Sure , ” I said .   
“
Let me get organized and I ’ll be right there .
”
He did n’t step out of the doorway .  
His arms remained folded , and he had paper in one of his hands , held where I might not notice it .
“ …
Actually , ” he said .
“
No , ” I said .  
I gave him a stern look .  
“
No .  
Do n’t ‘ actually’ me .  
Please .
”
“
Do you know anything about Fume Hood ?
”
I raised one eyebrow , keeping that stern look otherwise in place .   
“ Fume Hood ?  
No .
”
“
She apparently went by another name , a while back .  
Poison Apple ?
”
“
Then I do know stuff .   
She went by Bad Apple , ” I said .   
“ And a few other Nom De Pommes .  
I know some of her story .  
She was controversial .
”
“
She ’s a hero now , ” he said .   
“
She ’s getting announced as one member of a new team today .
” I nodded slowly , taking that in .   
“ That could be bad .
”
“
It ’s looking like it will be , ” Gilpatrick said .  
He revealed the papers .   
“
Can you brief my seniors ?  
Fill them in on who she is ?
”
“ That I can do , ” I said .  
I approached him and took the papers .
He did n’t let go of them .  
He opened his mouth .
“
No , ” I said .
“
I ’ve got too many new kids , ” he said .
“
No , Gilpatrick .
”
“ My hands are full .  
I do n’t have enough seniors to manage them all .  
I do n’t want this to be fun or even tolerable and that requires more supervision .
”
I let go of the paper , backing up .   
“
No
. ”
“
I wo n’t force you , ” he said .   
“
People connected the new heroine Fume Hood to her old persona .  
They ’re upset .   
Enough that they ’re hiring people to kick up a fuss , and we do n’t know just who or what ’s going to happen .
”
I thought of the people who ’d been in the crowd when the pillar had been hit .   
I could picture it .
“
Just that they ’re hiring people ?
” I asked .
“ From one of the more distant settlements .   
Police know and are taking precautions , hero teams have been notified , but it ’s messy .
”
“
Messy how ?
” I asked .
“ Jurisdictions .   
Our apple heroine is on a new team , announcing themselves in a new jurisdiction …
”
“ …
It makes them look bad if they accept outside help or have other teams elbowing in on their big first day .
”
“
Something like that , ” he said .   
“
Apple girl is getting a lot of serious hate thrown her way online .   
If you can tell us anything about how she might react to this situation , or anything else , that ’d help .
”
“ That I can do .
”
He went on , “
And if you could captain a squad of some new guys I ’ve got from another school , let me know if they ’re decent and trustworthy , and just do a bit of standing guard , giving advice and information to the officers at the scene , it would be a massive help .
”
I gave Gilpatrick my best angry glare , hands on my hips .
“
I wo n’t force you , ” he said .   
“
Superiors are pressuring me to handle this .   
If you say no then I ’ll figure something else out .
”
“
You know I ’m
taking it easy with all this stuff .  
I told you on day one I would n’t be one of your patrolers .  
I ’m only here to dispense some advice .
”
“
Yeah , ” he said .
“ I ’m not frontline .  
I ca n’t be frontline .
”
“
You ’re a natural leader , ” he said .
I shook my head .
“
I really did n’t want to use Jasper .  
He was joking about my speech , so I ’m going to make him deliver it to the recruits , ” he said .
I smiled , despite myself .  
That would be partially my fault , for reminding Jasper .
“
Can you do the briefing , at least ?
” Gilpatrick asked .
“
Yeah , ” I said .  
I dropped my hands from my hips .
“
She really called herself Fume Hood ?
”
“
Yeah , ” Gilpatrick said .   
“
I do n’t take many of the names seriously .  
This does n’t seem much worse .
”
“
It ’s really terrible ,
” I said .   
“
A heroine calling herself a hood ?  
As in a gangster ?
”
“ I think she has an actual hood as part of her costume .
”
“
I really hope so , ” I said .   
I sighed and looked at my shelves .   
“ Give me a second to review files ?  
I ’ll be right downstairs .
”
“ Just one second , ” he said .   
“
I ’m going to have Jasper start with the recruits .   
Try to be done before I send them scurrying off .
”
I checked the papers .  
Forum transcripts , some intercepted emails , some notes on Fume Hood .
I had a folder on my shelf .  
Notes from home .  
She was from Boston , among other places .  
Itinerant .
There were a lot of newspaper articles .  
She ’d drawn a lot of attention once .   
Everyone was supposed to be getting a second chance , and it seemed that people ’s memories were long enough that she was n’t necessarily getting hers .
I gathered everything together , and I headed downstairs .
Jasper was in front of an assembly of roughly a hundred kids .  
Boys and girls .  
Not all were ninth graders , new to high school .  
Some would be refugees , their educations interrupted by the rather massive inconvenience of the world ending .
“ …
mostly long treks into the middle of nowhere to deliver supplies or check on things .  
If we ’re lucky , we get a car .  
It ’s not glamorous .   
Seriously .   
Run away , ” he was saying .  
He spotted me coming down the stairs , and a smile crossed his face .   
“
Once you ’ve been with us for two years , you get one of these embarrassments and you have to be seen in public with them- ”
He held up a gun with slide back and magazine removed , a bright red bike lock threaded through the bottom of the gun and out the top .
Jasper went on , “ And you ’ll be expected to clean it as well as the gun you use on the range .  
You ’ll have to treat it like a real , loaded gun .  
That means you pretend it ’s loaded , you do n’t aim it at anything or anyone you would n’t want to destroy , you never leave it unattended , and so on .  
We ’ll drill it into your skull and frankly , we ’re really hoping you make a mistake so we can kick you to the curb .
”
The other senior students were dressed in their uniforms now .  
Black clothes with some body armor worn over them , and the body armor was recognizable .  
In places , flakes of the letters and symbols that had once been stenciled onto the armor panels in white were still visible , having survived the steel wool and turpentine scrub .  
PRT issue , salvaged .
When they ’d been trying to figure out what to do with the high school kids when there were n’t enough schools and seats for all of them , some idiot in the administration had come up with this .  
Some teenagers could go help on farms , some could get trained in construction , some would work , the ones who could keep their grades up enough could take afternoon classes too , and so on .  
There were sports teams and clubs .   
Finally , there was the patrol group .  
Us .
Maybe it was n’t fair to blame it on an idiot in charge .  
Maybe it was inevitable .  
Some wanted to feel like they had power , when the capes had dropped the ball .  
Some wanted answers .  
We talked and ran errands pertaining to power stuff .  
Some of the kids might go on to police , investigate , or study the power stuff , as more informed police officers .  
Possibly .
This was the thirty percent I did n’t like .  
The question mark .  
The places this could lead , theoretically .   
Places we were already starting to edge toward , slowly but surely .
“
Less than five pounds of gun , if you even have a gun , ” Jasper said , holding up the gun with the bike lock threaded through it .  
He caught my eye as he said it and he had a gleam in his eye .   
“
Fifteen pounds of armor .  
It ’ll be twenty - five pounds of armor if you ’re with us for the long haul .  
These backpacks ?  
They ’re heavy .  
They ’re miserable .  
Twenty - five pounds strapped to you .  
Food , water , first aid , tools .
”
He holstered his gun and lifted up the bag with two hands , grunting a bit .
“
Pay attention to those ratios .   
Twenty - five pounds of stuff to support and help …
”
He dropped the bag and gave it a pat .
“ …
A good bit of protection …
”
He rapped knuckles against the armor he wore on his chest .
“ …
And possibly a bit of offense .
”
He tapped the gun where it was in its holster , the bike lock draped down and resting against his leg Gilpatrick stepped up beside Jasper .   
“
Good .
”
“ Thank you sir .
”
“ Students , if you ’ll turn around to see the young lady on the stairs …
”
The students did .
“ …
She ’s our resident cape expert .  
If you ’re sticking with us here in patrol block , if her door is open , you can go ask her questions .  
She knows her stuff .  
If you ’re not sticking with us and her door is open , you can go ask her questions and we ’ll let you cut to the head of the line .  
You ’ll find her office upstairs and to the left .
”
I had n’t heard that part before .   
Priority to people who were n’t part of the club .   
I smiled .
We had more kids than we wanted or could use , even though we did n’t pay any wages until they ’d been with us at least a year , and we did everything we could to keep them miserable .  
Powers were compelling .  
Too many had reasons for wanting to be here .
An unfortunate share of the students were here because they were angry .   
Because the patrol block had been started up by some ex - PRT folk and Gilpatrick
’s speech aside , a lot of people looked at the armor , looked at the guns , looked at how we touched on the power stuff and the portals , and connected the dots .
“ You want to go brief my seniors ?
”
he asked me , from the far end of the room , over the heads of hundreds of new students .
I gave him a mock salute , then finished descending the stairs , joining the seniors while he resumed outlining things for the new kids .  
I motioned to the door , indicating for the group to follow .
A few of them were new , Gilpatrick had said .  
I did n’t like how angry or naturally resentful some of them looked .  
Cami was among them .
“
New team is having its grand unveiling at one of the community centers , ” I said .   
“ One member is Fume Hood .  
She was a B - list villain , once upon a time .  
She ’s what we term itinerant .  
Wandered from city to city , looking for opportunities or teams to join .  
Petty robbery , grand larceny , mischief , vandalism , criminal mercenary work .  
A lot of the time she was one of the low - rate hangers - on in a group that a bigger villain would hire to pull a bigger job .  
You could even call her a professional distraction .  
She started when she was sixteen , stopped at twenty - four or so .  
She ’d be twenty - nine now .
”
They were listening intently , even the new guys .  
That was good .
“
As a villain , she went by Bad Apple , Poison Apple , Pomme De Sang , probably called herself Applesauce , I do n’t even know .  
I guess she wanted to corner the market on apple - related names
so nobody would have something similar .  
She spent a lot of time palling around with a biotinker called Blasto .  
She kept going back to him to pair up .  
Might have been boyfriend - girlfriend , even .  
That ended when the Slaughterhouse Nine passed through Boston .  
We do n’t know what happened to Blasto , but we can guess it was n’t good .  
Poison Apple got a little reckless after that , even though she had n’t met up with him in over a year at that point .
”
I opened my folder and found one of the articles .  
I laid it against the front of the folder and held it out so they could read it .
“
She pulled together a group of some old teammates and new teenage villains and pulled a shopping spree , hit a mall and took what they wanted .   
Heroes showed up , they ran .
”
“ Miscarriage , ” one of the new people in the group said , reading from the article .
“
Poison Apple makes globes in her hands .   
One of the tricks she can pull with them is send them flying off in straight lines .   
They explode on contact with hard surfaces , just enough oomph to knock you to the ground , and they create clouds of gas or splashes of liquid poison .  
Usually enough to make you nauseous , a little bit feeble , more if you touch the poison in its liquid form .   
Nonlethal and mostly nonviolent , most of the time .   
Except this time , a pregnant lady was caught in the gas , or in the explosion .  
She lost her baby , and it became a thing in the media .   
Poison Apple turned herself in , partially because of the backlash she ’d generated .  
She was serving time for pled down charges of assault and battery when Gold Morning came around , ” I said .
A couple of the angry faces in the group looked a little angrier .
“
She did her time , ” I said .   
“
She made a mistake , she paid for it as much as she was able .  
We do n’t have enough good jails
and so she ’s free , and it looks like she ’s trying to do good .  
That ’s pretty decent , really .   
She ’s not the enemy here .
”
“ Is n’t she ?
” someone asked .   
Their name might have been James .   
They ’d been around last year .
“
The threat is the people targeting her .   
They ’ve recruited help .   
We do n’t know how much , but the intel Gilpatrick gave me said money changed hands .   
You guys know the basics when it comes to capes , you can inform the cops if something comes up , you know her story , and you ’ll be a few more people in uniform keeping the peace and giving protesters a little more reason to hang back .   
If it gets bad , any real danger , you back off .
”
There were a few nods .
There were also a few looks on a handful of faces that made me concerned .   
Too heated , or too cold .   
They were n’t the majority , but I was n’t sure the majority was on Fume Hood ’s side , either .
It put me in mind of the crowd and the broken pillar .   
If it was just this , I might have been able to let it lie .   
I could have accepted that the students here were among the angriest and most invested in the grittier side of the cape stuff .   
That it was just them .
Except it was n’t .   
The old man , the girl who could n’t drive , the crowd there and the response to the visiting cape … there was so much emotion bound up in things , I could n’t trust that this was an isolated thing .
I could n’t stand by and let this be the new normal , without any opposing voices .   
Even if my voice was a badly biased one .
With the climate , both general and even the fact that it was hot and tempers would be short , it would be so easy for us to see another Vikare .
I glanced over my shoulder and through the door .   
I saw Gilpatrick with Jasper and the kids .
Damn it , Gilpatrick .
“ I ’ll come with you , ” I decided .   
“
We ’ll do our part to keep people organized and keep the peace .
”
What did it say about the state of things , if I was increasingly the voice of restraint and reason ?
I turned my attention back to the squad .








I had badly neglected my locker .   
I had an office , so my locker in the changing room was more for the things I did n’t use much at all .
Bag .   
The backpack was light , but it only had the nonperishables in it .   
I ’d done a few patrols for Gilpatrick over the winter , visiting some of the settlements that were a little further afield , while many of the students were taking Christmas off .   
I ’d also used it for my fitness test .
I set it on the table in the center of the room .   
Something to weigh when I was done getting outfitted .   
For now , I just needed it out of my locker .   
The bag took up the bottom half , the armor took up the upper half .
Outfit change .   
I could n’t go out in a skirt and body armor .   
I had some self respect .   
The pants in my locker were part of an emergency change of clothes , heavier fabric intended for winter and trips to Bet when the weather was bad .
I had n’t put the pants through the wash since having to shovel snow over the winter , but I had n’t worn them much either .   
There was still salt crusting the heels , white against black fabric .   
I walked over to the sink and rinsed the worst of the salt off , then rolled up the cuffs a bit
so I would n’t have wet pants slapping against my ankle .
I kicked off my shoes and hiked up the pants so they were under my skirt , then unfastened the skirt .
“ Victoria ,
” Gilpatrick said , behind me , a deep male voice in the girl ’s change room .   
I jumped a little .   
“
Are you free to talk ?
”
I turned my head .   
There was n’t a door to the girl
’s changing room , but there was a solid wall blocking the view .   
I could see the edge of Gilpatrick ’s arm –
he stood with his back to the wall and the changing room .
Camisola was in the room too , unpacking and repacking her kits for her bag .   
She met my eyes .
“
I ’ll step out , ” she said .
“
Thank you , Cami , ” Gilpatrick said .   
I pulled my shoes back on and laced them as Cami left the room .
Belt .   
Holster .   
I threaded the belt through my belt loops , careful to position the holster .
Cami was apparently out of earshot , because Gil spoke again .   
“
Thank you , Victoria .
”
“ Give me Jasper , ” I said .   
“ For my squad .
”
“ Jasper ?
” he asked .   
“
Why ?
”
Well , that said a lot , did n’t it ?
“
Because I ’m paranoid , ” I said .   
Paranoid on more than one front , but I would n’t tell Gilpatrick that .   
I had suspicions and his willingness to give me Jasper would tell me things .   
“
Is anyone else standing outside the door ?
”
“
This conversation is just you and me .
”
“
Okay .   
I know Jasper , and I ’m honestly more worried about the attitudes of the people you gave me than I am about the protest or
whatever it is people are going to pull with Bad Apple .
”
“
Jasper ’s attitude is n’t great .
”
“ Jasper is a joker and he can be immature , but he can give that five pounds of gun speech because he believes it .   
He ’s in this because he thinks capes are cool , not because he ’s pissed .   
Give me one person
I know will agree with me .
”
“ I kind of need every senior I can get .   
But I ’ll give you that .
” I bit my lip , thinking as I worked the combination of the safe at the topmost section of my locker .   
I pulled out the pistol and holstered it .   
I kept my hand there , reminding myself of the weapon ’s weight as I tried to figure out how to word my question , and if I wanted to ask it .
“
Then how about you take some of the angry ones ?   
The new guys you were giving me .
”
“
That was a quick assessment .
”
I gathered the pistol magazines and slotted them into the pouch , before setting to attaching the pouch to my leg and belt .   
“ I do n’t want them .   
I do n’t want to get some people from elsewhere with their own habits and ways of doing things , and have to train them on top of doing this thing .
”
“ Take them , Victoria , ” Gilpatrick said .   
“
They came with good recommendations , they know their stuff , and if it does wind up being a protest , you ’ll want the extra bodies .   
If it does n’t , then it does n’t matter .
”
“
Things are never that simple , Gil , ” I said .
“ Take them , ” he said , firm .
“
You owe me for this , ” I said .
“ I know , ” he said .
I sighed .
Armor .   
I pulled my vest from the bottom of the locker .   
I saved it for last because once it was on , I would n’t be able to bend down or move as easily .   
The old name and number was still visible by the impression that had been made in the armor when it had been punched in and painted on .   
The steel - wool scrubbing I ’d given it had n’t erased the whole impression .
I did n’t know who Cameron was or where they ’d ended up , but I wore their armor now .   
I tucked the papers in between my chest and the armor , where the straps would help keep them in place .
I spoke , “
It ’s a cushy job , I get to geek out and show off , and I like my office and the access I get to the portal , I do n’t want to take that for granted , but you owe me a few already .   
This is one more .
”
“ I know , ” he said .   
“
I ’ll make it up to you .   
I ’ve got to run .   
Kids to torture .   
I ’ll send Jasper your way .
”
“
Alright , ” I said .   
“
Do I need my full pack ?
”
“
No , ” he said .   
“
No , I would n’t do that to you .   
Full pack is a torment I reserve for the newbies .
”
I was glad to put my bag back in the locker .   
I heard Gilpatrick walking away , raising his voice to shout orders .
I used fingernails to comb my hair back , then began braiding it .   
I had to look in the mirror to make sure I ’d gotten all of the stray strands .
Hi me , I thought , as I made eye contact .
How to describe that feeling ?   
Something resembling relief and a sinking feeling at the same time .
It was a small feeling but still one that I would carry with me for the rest of the day .   
That day would be a little bit worse because of the moment , but it would feel more stable for the reminder , too .
I had a good two years of experience to draw from , in figuring that out .
I ’d stopped braiding my hair , I realized , and I ’d started holding my breath without realizing it .   
I exhaled , closed the safe , spun the dial , closed the locker , and walked out onto the floor of the building , resuming the braiding of my hair .
Forward .   
Breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth .   
Moving on with the day .
I caught up with Jasper as he joined the group .
“
I ’m driving , apparently , ” Jasper said , wangling the keys in front of me .   
“ And keeping you company .   
Gilpatrick explained the situation .
”
“
Good , ” I said .   
I pointed in the direction of the bus .   
We started walking .
“
You ’re friends ?
” one of the new guys asked .
Still braiding , I looked over at Jasper .   
“ Enhh .
”
“
You can tell she
’s really diplomatic , ” Jasper said .
“
Work friends , kind of ?
” I said .
“ We do n’t hang out , ” Jasper said .   
“
I ’m not sure what we ’d do if we did .   
We do n’t have anything in common .
”
“ We got stuck together for jobs and errands enough times we became familiar with each other , ” I said .   
“
We get on
okay .   
Jasper ’s cool .   
Just do n’t ask him about the tattoo .
”
“ Tattoo ?
” someone asked .
“ I ’ll explain when we ’re driving , ” Jasper said , smiling .
We reached the bus .   
It was n’t pretty .   
A half - size school bus , rust had been mostly scrubbed away and it had received a paint job in black with white sides .   
The emergency exit at the back had been redone so it was the main way in and out , and a passenger seat had been added at the front .   
There was an area for supplies and bags to be stowed between the wheels at the right side .
I wrapped my braid around itself a few times , and tied it there in a slightly messy bun - coil , then climbed up to the passenger seat .   
The seniors climbed into the back .   
There were a few faces I recognized but could n’t name , a dozen more that I did n’t recognize and definitely could n’t name .   
I could tell that they were from elsewhere by the fact that the armor they ’d brought with them had been painted black , rather than have the white letters scrubbed away .   
Twenty - four in all .
Jasper took the driver
’s seat , starting up the bus immediately .
Even parked in the shade , even in September , the heat was such that the seats were uncomfortably hot .   
I ’d thought about removing my armor once my hands were free , and carrying it by hand , but I decided to keep it on for the extra buffer .
Did n’t do anything to spare my ass from the warm faux - leather seat .   
I did n’t like being aware of my body to that extent .
“ Where to ? ”
Jasper asked , rescuing me from my thoughts .
“ Norwalk - Fairfield span , ” I said .
“ Rural , is n’t that ?
” Jasper asked .
“
Last I heard .
”
Jasper had to almost stand up to get the perspective to see through the open back of the bus .   
He reversed out of the lot and took us onto the road .
“ Maybe you guys can answer .   
What ’s the deal with stretches and spans ?
” one of the new guys asked .
I turned sideways in my seat , looking back .   
Now that I was sitting and looking back at them , they were older , I noted .   
Seventeen at a minimum .   
“
You guys are from one of the denser parts of the city ?
”
“ New York Central .   
Near the Bet - Gimel portal , ” a girl said .
One of the two big ones , then .   
We ’d bled into the areas surrounding the portals .   
Brockton Bay had been the first , but we ’d had a few in a few major cities and New York was a big one .   
The cluster of settlements around the portals in the northeastern US and people ’s desire to have ready access to that cluster and the resources , community , information and security it afforded had played a big part in the megalopolis forming .
One blob around New York , one blob around the New Brockton settlement , clusters south of New Brockton , near what would or should be Boston , and everything had spread out or extended from there , mostly hugging the coast and connecting to one another .
I explained , “ We ’ve got these long narrow bands of mingled city and agriculture connecting the primary settlement points , to the point it ’s hard to say where one thing starts and the other ends .   
And instead of building five big houses they ’d rather build an apartment building that hosts twenty , which makes things fuzzy with the distinctions of urban and rural .   
So we get the ever - expanding megalopolis blob
and we ca n’t figure out what to call it , even though it ’s already this monster .
”
Our progress out of the city center was slow .   
Construction .   
Endless construction .   
Jasper seemed happy to be driving , even at a crawl .
“
Yeah , ” the first guy spoke .
“
In terms of the bands that rope everything in together , we go by the cities and locations that were there beforehand .   
If you look at where Norwalk would be on a map , that ’s the name for the region we ’re heading to .   
If it ’s east - west
it ’s a span .   
If it ’s north - south
it ’s a stretch .   
But it ’s all a part of the city .
”
“
What if it ’s both ?
” someone asked .
“
Then it ’s neither , ” Jasper said .   
“
You just give it a name .
”
“
More accurately , you try to give it a name and end up in a heated , months - long debate about what to call the area , with way too many emotions tied up into things , ” I said .
The guy from right behind me said , “ I do n’t see why we ca n’t just give the individual areas names like they used to have .   
If it ’s close to Norwalk , then we call it fucking Norwalk .
”
“
Hey , ” I said .   
I gave a stern look to the guy who ’d said it .   
“
Swearing ’s fine , but not if you ’re getting heated .   
We ’re chatting , not getting up in arms .
”
“
Right .   
Sorry , ” the guy said .   
He did n’t look particularly sorry .
We picked up speed as we pulled onto a street with less construction .   
With the back of the bus open and the windows on either side of Jasper and me rolled all the way down , the wind whipped through the bus .   
The city smelled like dust , drywall , and hot pavement .
I dangled one arm out the window , moving my fingers and feeling the air moving against them .
“ It gets complicated , ” I said .   
“ Geography ’s slightly different , they ’re hardly checking longitude and latitude exactly when we settle in one place or another .   
They ’re doing what the surroundings allow .   
Means the Norwalk
we ’re going to might actually be between two places , or off to one side .
”
Jasper chimed in , “ I always remember the Norwalk - Fairfield span because it ’s close to the portal for Earth N.    N for Norwalk .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
I guess that works .
”
“ I ’ve got a question for you , though , ” he said .
“ You want to talk about your tattoo idea .
”
“
Yes , ” he said .
I rolled my eyes .   
“
Do what you want .
”
He turned his head so he could talk to the back of the bus while watching the road .   
“
We ’re doing the squad thing , right ?   
And a lot of us are doing this with the idea we ’ll police the capes , or help them out .
”
“ Police them , mostly , ” a guy said .
“
Opinions vary , ” Jasper said , “ But I do n’t want to get sidetracked .   
What I ’m thinking is , what ’s better than a good callsign ?   
We have nicknames to call each other .   
The trouble is getting a good one to stick .
”
“
Opinions on what a good callsign is are going to vary , ” I said .
“
Quiet you , ” Jasper said .   
“
You and I have talked about this
and I ’ve determined you have no idea what you ’re talking about when it comes to this .   
You know the cape stuff , sure , but you clearly do n’t get this .
”
“ You want to decide your own callsign ?
” the girl from the back asked .
“ Jester , ” Jasper said .   
“
And I swear , if people do n’t start using it , I ’m going to make it happen by getting a tattoo of a jester and ‘ fool’ written beneath it , right on my bicep .
”
The protests , naturally , started rolling in from the rest of the bus .   
He could n’t decide his own callsign , why would he have
it say fool if he wanted the callsign to be Jester , why even have it be Jester ?
I tuned it out , sticking my head out the window .   
Jasper tried to sell the rest of the bus on his idea and was very thoroughly shot down .   
In this , at least , all was right with the world .   
It was a bad idea .   
Forty year - old Jasper did n’t need to live with the mistakes of seventeen year - old Jasper .
We drove past skyscrapers paneled in gold - tinted glass .   
Solar glass , it was supposed to be called .   
We drove past parks with the same rough - edged slice of nature that touched the schoolyard back at the high school .   
We drove past a lot of construction , and we were lucky that it did n’t slow us down much .
“ Victoria Dallon .
”
I ’d heard my name .   
I was broken from my reverie .   
How long had we been driving now ?   
The city was seemingly unending and I did n’t recognize the landmarks enough to nail anything down .
Victoria Dallon .   
I looked at myself in the bus’ side view mirror .
“
What was that ?
”
Jasper asked , while I remained silent .
“
Name sounds familiar , ” the voice said , from the back .   
It sounded almost smug , knowing .   
“
Ca n’t quite place it .
”
“
That so ? ” Jasper asked .   
“
Maybe keep it to yourself , then .
”
“
Is that how this is ?
”
“ I think it ’s how everything is , ” Jasper said .   
“ Not just this .   
When you ’re bringing up the past , whoever you ’re talking to , there are two likely possibilities .
First , it ’s good , and we miss the shit out of it , or , second , it ’s bad and why would you bring up the bad except to be a tool ?
”
“
It could be important , ” the guy said .   
“
It ’s good to know who or what we ’re dealing with .
”
“ Could be , ” Jasper said .   
“
But I can tell you this .   
Gil trusts her .   
I trust her .   
If you want to know who you ’re dealing with , why do n’t you start by taking our cue ?
”
There was no response from the back .
“
Otherwise , if you ’re not going to listen to us , ” Jasper said , “ why are you on our bus ?
”
Again , no response .
Then , belated , one of the others uttered a quiet , “ Leave it .
”
Not aimed at Jasper .   
My detractor had been about to say something , I took it , and he ’d been told to be quiet .   
Not the best result , but it seemed to end the line of questioning .
I wondered if there was something nice
I could do for Jasper , for sparing me having to handle that .
I fished the papers out from my vest , smoothing them against my lap .   
I glanced out the window .   
The city had thinned out , and I could see farms and tent cities further out .
We had to be pretty close to our destination now .
I twisted around in my seat again , looking at the people in the back .   
I could tell by the way one of them held himself , shoulders square , eye contact forced , that he ’d been the one to speak out against me .   
He studied me like he would an opponent .
I addressed them , “ When we get there , we stay together .   
We ’ll have a quick chat with the people in charge , all together .   
If the police have orders for us , those are the orders we follow .   
If not , I ’ll tell you guys to get to work .   
You head to the crowd , and you say hi .
”
“
Say hi ?
”
“ Mingle .   
Show your faces , let people know we ’re around .   
Ask how they ’re doing .   
What do they think ?   
Look for anyone antsy , especially anyone antsy that we ’re there .   
Do n’t engage if there ’s trouble .   
Let the police know and let me know , and we ’ll figure it out .
”
“ I like looping through the crowds , ” Jasper said .   
“
We did that once or twice , when Gilpatrick was calling the shots , last year .   
People do n’t see the face or the hair , only the uniform .   
If you loop back , it looks like there are more of us than there are .
”
“ Give them second thoughts ?
” the girl from the back asked .
“
Something like that , ” Jasper said .
I wrapped up .   
“ When we get settled and things are going to start , we ’ll be keeping eyes out or standing guard , probably .   
We regroup before then , we ’ll figure out what ’s up , and see where we ’re needed .
”
I saw people nod , then turned around in my seat .
“
Which street ?
” Jasper asked .
“ Myrtle .
”
“ I think that ’s it down there , ” he said .
There were still a lot of tents and cubicle houses hereabouts , it seemed .   
On the southern side of the main road , to our left , we had apartment buildings , stores , and something that looked like a brand spanking new swathe of city .   
On the other side , it was more construction , tents , farm , and the houses that were n’t real houses- more like mock houses made of panels that had been bolted together , like overlarge tents with hard exteriors .
We turned away from the main road , into the deeper section of the city .   
The community center was made of stone , had a squat clock tower situated on top ,    and looked stately , even with the tall buildings surrounding it , many at least as tall as the community center was .   
A patch of park with a fountain sat squarely in front of it .
School was just getting out , it seemed .   
Students were streaming through the area .   
They walked through and along the road to the point that we could n’t get very close .   
Many heads turned our way , curious .
Jasper found a parking space a block away from the center , and parked there .   
Our people climbed out the back while Jasper and I got organized at the front .
“ Jasper , ” I said .
“ Special orders for me ?
”
“
When and if the rest of them are going through the crowd , stay near the front door .   
If anyone gets nervous and ducks out , it might be something .
”
“
Should I follow ?
”
“ Probably not .   
Keep an eye out , let me know if anything happens .
”
“
And why is this a secret from the others ?
”
Because I did n’t trust the others .   
They ’d been foisted on me , they had clear attitudes , and I was worried that if push came to shove , they might let a troublemaker go if it meant fucking with the capes .
“
Paranoia , ” I said .   
I started to climb out of my seat .   
“
Thanks for the backup back there .   
Jester .
”
Jasper grinned as my face fell .
“
I ’m sorry , but it sounds bad , ” I said .   
“
I ca n’t make this a thing .
”
“
It sounds bad when you ’re saying it as if someone ’s pulling your fingernails out while you ’re talking .
”
“ They might as well be , ” I said .
“
It ’s good , ” he said .   
“
It ’s cool .
”
“
It ’s against everything I stand for , ” I said .   
I climbed down from my seat .
“
It ’s great , ” Jasper said , from the other side of the bus .   
He tossed the keys into the air and caught them .
Some of the others were pulling on the armor they ’d left off while sitting on the bus .   
Once we were set , we moved as a group toward the town hall .
The fact that the community center was actually in the center of this neighborhood meant that the foot traffic was heavy .   
A lot of it was moving around the crowd that had formed .   
A lot of people with signs , but a lot of young and eager eyes .   
Kids aged ten to seventeen , all fresh from their first day of school , genuinely interested in their fledgling hero team .
No police parked outside , at a glance .   
No barricades , either .
Inside , it was standing room only .   
Cheap plastic chairs were arranged in rows and columns , and there were many places where parent and young child shared chairs .
I saw some people up at the front perk up at our appearance , and the crowd parted to let us through .
I identified a woman with gray and black hair and a gray suit - dress that the other people up at the front seemed to be standing around .   
I approached her .
“
You ’re in charge ?
” I asked .
“
I ’m the closest thing to someone in charge .   
District representative , ” she said .   
“
We do n’t have a group like yours here .   
You ’re all so young .
”
I kept still , not letting my emotions show .   
I felt the sinking feeling again , without the relief , and without the steadiness that I got from seeing myself in the mirror .
Not a big thing .   
It was like treading water and a hand on my forehead pushing me down , before pulling away .   
Surfacing again , finding my equilibrium , realizing how tired I was as I resumed treading water .
I was very aware of the eyes on us .
“
Do you have more outside ?
” the representative asked .
“
More … of us ?
”
I asked , finding my composure again .
“
Yes .
”
“
No .   
No we do n’t have more outside .
”
She looked spooked .   
More spooked after my ‘ no’ .
“ I ca n’t help but notice that you have no police presence at all , ” I said .
“
We have some , but not many .   
It ’s the way it is in Norfair span .
”
“ Norfair , ” I said , noting the coined name .   
“
It ’s not really a presence , is it ?
”
“
No , ” she said .   
“
We did n’t expect this many naysayers .   
With this many , they had to have come from outside the community .
”
The crowd in the room with us looked eager and happy enough .   
A few frowns , but rare .   
Had it been just this , overlapping conversations , anticipation , bright eyes and parents with kids , maybe a few people ready to raise some pointed questions if given the opportunity , then all would have been well .
It was n’t just them .   
The protesters outside were audible , even with stone walls between us and them .   
Two angry voices outside , for every one quiet , polite person inside .
I did n’t like how much this was stacking up against us .   
The police not having much presence , the controversy , the number of protesters .
Paranoia again , that I could n’t help but wonder about the recruits I ’d been given .   
Forced to take , as it had turned out .
Too many things together .
“ I think we should talk to the capes , ” I said .
“ Please , ” the district rep said .
She led us into the back room , just behind where the de - facto stage was .   
The team of heroes was there , anxious , waiting to be announced and to step out in front of the crowd .
Four of them .   
Their costumes were close to being clothing , but had just enough stylization to make them something more .   
The masks and face - coverings helped to make them more cape - like .
Fume Hood did have a hood , as part of a green hooded coat she wore .   
Fans were built into the coat , only partially disguised , each of them much like the ones that were built into the back of a computer , and they made her coat , hair , and hood flap .
There was a man in a deep purple tank top and skinny pants with glass jutting from his skin at the elbows and hands , his upper face only a craggy mass of glass or jewel - like shards sticking out of flesh , just beautiful enough to not be macabre .
A man about my age slouched in a chair , looking dejected .   
He had something that looked like small shields over the back of each hand , three large scimitar - like blades jutting from the back of each shield like they were oversize claws .   
He wore a top that showed his muscular stomach , with shorts that reached his knees .   
A two - part icon was displayed on chest and belt buckle .
The last was a woman in overalls , muscular , with hair shorter than most of the boys in my troupe , something that looked like thick paint slashed across her eyes and nose , and covering her arms up to the elbows .   
The paint was black at the very edges , where it was thinner , but pure white elsewhere .   
Her eyes were black from corner to corner .
“
Great , ” the woman with the paint said , sarcastic .   
“ Just what we needed .
”
“ We ’re here to help , ” I said .
“ We might need it , ” Fume Hood said .
“
Do you know who ’s after you ?
” I asked .   
“ Or what ’s going on ?
”
She shook her head .
“ I might be being paranoid , but this feels off , ” I said .
“
A lot of little things , ” Fume Hood said .   
“ Crystalclear ’s getting a bad vibe .
” I nodded .   
I looked at the man with the glass chunks where his nose , eyes , brow and scalp should be .
“
Have you considered canceling the event ?
” I asked .
“
We were actively debating it before you came in , ” the man in purple said .   
“ We ’re split .
”
“
Can we break the tie ?
”
I asked .
They exchanged glances .
The painted woman scowled , “ You can .
”
The man with the claws stood abruptly , shoving his chair to the ground in the process , before stalking off .
“
Okay , ” the painted woman said , again .   
She looked at the district rep .   
“
We ’re sorry .   
Can you have them disperse ?   
Tell the protesters they win .
”
The rep nodded , hurrying from the room to where the people were seated .
“
Death knell for our group , ” the painted woman said .
“ Maybe .   
Probably , ” Fume said .   
She looked at Crystalclear .   
“ Feeling better ?
”
“
No , ” he said .
Fume nodded at that .
“
Would you stick around ?
”
Crystalclear addressed us .   
“
I would n’t mind the backup , if you ’re here to help , and I have the sense this is going to get worse before it gets better .
”
“ Gut feeling sense or … power sense ?
”
I asked .
I could hear the commotion as people started to leave .   
I could hear the complaining .   
Even before he answered , my gut feeling sense was that he was n’t wrong .








This was the point in time that I would have liked to be able to take to the skies .   
Information was important , and if I did n’t have surveillance cameras , I would have been pretty content with a bird ’s eye view of the scene .
I clenched one fist , cracking my knuckles , before wrapping my other hand around it , cracking them again for good measure .
I turned to look at the people from the patrol .   
“ Set up around the building .   
Watch what ’s going on outside , stay in touch , report anything unusual .   
Jasper ?   
Hang back .
”
The others turned to go , some looking back at the capes one last time before leaving .   
Interest , other things .
“
Ca n’t hurt , ” the painted lady said .
“
I ’m
Victoria , ”
I said .   
“
That ’s Jasper .   
I know Fume Hood from the notes we got , and I caught Crystalclear ’s name .
”
“ Longscratch is the one who just left , ” the painted lady said .   
“
I ’m Tempera .
”
“ Thanks , ” I said .   
“ Good
to meet you .   
Crystalclear , can you fill me in on your power ?   
What are you getting ?
”
“ I see through everything , ” Crystalclear said , tapping the chunk of crystal that stood out from the lower edge of his eye socket .   
“ As if everything was crystal .   
I ’ve learned there ’s a lot of nuance to it .   
A little bit of seeing into the past , a little bit of seeing into the future , a little bit of a sense of people ’s focus .
”
“
He has a blaster power too , ” Tempera said .   
“ Goes through walls and the ground .   
Synergy .
”
“
I really hope it does n’t come to actually using that .   
Right now , I ’m more interested in how this points to possible trouble in the future , ” I said .
“ Uh , ” Crystalclear said .   
He looked around .   
“
It ’s hard to explain because it ’s not a sense anyone else has .   
Say I was looking at a wall .   
It looks like a chunk of clear glass and the light catches at the edges and corners and they ’re highlighted .
”
My eye roved over the room .   
It was reminiscent of a teacher ’s lounge , but it had less of an emphasis on the lounging .   
Coffee cups sat on windowsills and there were places where furniture had been stacked once , and the furniture had been moved out into the open room at the front of the building , where all the people were or had been seated .   
Glass cases with model buildings had been brought inside and carefully stacked against the wall .   
A long table that might have served as a conference table was folded up in one corner .
I tried to imagine it like Crystalclear was describing it .   
A sketch in three dimensions , only the lines visible .   
“
I follow you so far .
”
“
The edges of walls and floor are usually clear , crisp , and closer to white .   
Solid objects do n’t change , so there ’s no reason for that to change .   
It ’s blurred .   
Blue tinted .
”
“
Future sight , ” Tempera added .   
“ Past - sight is red , future - sight is blue .   
Like the doppler .
” Crystalclear went on , “ In the future , that wall vibrates .   
Similar effect with people , but they move around more .   
I see you all as streaks , shifting around , white - edged where you ’re resting in present .   
There is refraction and some fractures around people ’s heads , representing focus and kind of thinking .
”
“ That gets blueshifted redshifted ?
” I asked .   
“
It ’s not displayed as color ?
”
Crystalclear nodded his head .  
It was a motion made more weighty by the heavy growth at the top of his head .   
“ Not as color .   
It ’s …
edges to the light around them , sharpness and softness , distortions like how you can look at a glass of water with a straw in it and the straw is n’t straight , or you see multiple straws .   
The worst breaks in focus look like grooves or outright breaks .   
A lot of people here are going to be distorted soon .   
Or were .   
They ’re leaving and they ’re clearing up .
”
His head turned as he focused on things on the other sides of the walls .
“ What about , say , Jasper ?
”   
I asked .
“
Hey , ” Jasper said .   
“ Use yourself as an example .
”
Crystalclear looked at Jasper .   
“
Hard to say .   
Whatever it is , it ’s small or it ’s distant .
”
Crystalclear glanced over at Tempetera and Fume Hood .   
“ Not just him either .   
It does n’t give me much to work with .
”
He turned his attention to me .
I cut right to asking my next question , before he could comment .   
“
Do you see the direction of it ?   
Anything big and blue that ’s suggesting a major thing coming in sometime in the future ?   
One section of the building that gets hit harder ?
”
He shook his head .   
“
I ’d have to see it before I saw how things were around it , and even then there ’s nuance .
”
“ You ’re thinking of a parahuman or weapon ?
” Tempera asked .
“
I have no idea , ” I said .   
“ If I was a civilian with an issue , and I was going after capes , I ’d go big or I would n’t try at all .   
If we ’re talking something that shakes this whole community center … bomb ?   
Parahumans are definitely possible , except I ’m not sure how using parahumans squares with the sentiment toward parahumans .
”
Fume Hood spoke up from the background .   
“
Set us against each other , they benefit either way .
”
“ Could be , ” I said .   
I paused .   
“
As soon as the crowd has dispersed enough , I want to get you guys clear of here .   
Do you have a decent mover power to use ?
”
“ Longscratch does , ” Tempera said .
“
Not a mass mover power , is it ?
” I asked .   
At the negation , I turned to Jasper .   
“
Can you bring the bus close ?   
If the crowd is thinning out , you should be able to pull right up to the door .   
Take someone with you , if we ’re delayed , do like I discussed earlier .   
Keep an eye out .
”
Jasper saluted , turning to go .
The bus was n’t elegant , but hopefully it would take us away from vulnerable civilians or areas .
“
How is Longscratch ?
”
Tempera asked Crystalclear .
“
He ’s fine .   
Stalked off .   
He ’s keeping an eye out for trouble , ” Crystalclear said .   
He pointed up and off to one side .   
On an upper floor , it seemed , or on the roof .
“
That ’s how he is .   
I wo n’t bother him .   
I ’ll go talk to the district representative , instead , if that ’s alright , ” Tempera said , looking my way .
“ If the coast is clear , ” I said .
“ Most people have cleared out of the main hall , ” Crystalclear said .   
“
The ones who are hanging back seem like the types to be doing it for good reason .   
Parents with kids , teenagers hoping to get a glimpse of the heroes they came to see .
”
“
That ’s positive , ” Tempera said .   
“ I ’ll give them a glimpse then .   
Thank you , Victoria .
”
“
I ’m going to get a glass of water and get my head straight , ” Fume Hood said .   
“ I ’ll catch up with the rest of you in a minute .
”
“ Do n’t go running off , ” Tempera said .   
“
Get your water , take a minute , but come back after .   
I do n’t want you to throw yourselves to the wolves .
”
“ I wo n’t , ” Fume Hood said .
“ Or whatever variant on that plan you might be thinking .   
I can see you trying to lead the enemy way from us , ” Tempera said .
“ I wo n’t , ” Fume Hood said , annoyed .
“
It would n’t work anyway , ” Crystalclear added .
“
Your future sight telling you that ?
”
Fume Hood asked , her annoyance becoming something more bitter .
“ I do n’t see the future like that .   
You know that .   
But I do know that they ’re mad at all of us .   
Our fortunes are intertwined , and their hate is-
it ’s not very targeted .
”
“
Not hate , ” I said .
They looked my way .
“
It ’s easy to see it as hate , but I ’ve been thinking about it a lot , ” I said .   
“
It ’s not that .   
It ’s blame .
”
“ Blame , ” Fume Hood said .
“ I do n’t think it ’s a reflection on you .   
Humanity is hurt .   
It ’s hurt in a way that makes it a little bit animal .   
Reactive .   
They ’re snapping at any target that presents itself , because the hurt is fresh .   
They ’re taking that hurt and they ’re looking for anyone they can put it onto .   
You … ”
I trailed off .
“
We presented ourselves , ” Tempera said .
“ Not in a bad way , ” I said .   
“
This is n’t your fault .
”
“ I ’ll get my water , ” Fume Hood said , curt .   
She did n’t wait for a response , heading into the adjacent room , further from the front of the building .
Once Fume Hood was gone , Tempera nudged Crystalclear .   
“
Keep an eye on them ?
” Crystalclear nodded .
Tempera gave me a nod before stepping out the door .
“
Is Fume Hood going to be okay ?
” I asked .
“
Who knows ?
” he asked .
“
Trouble still is n’t imminent ?
”
Crystalclear shook his head .   
“
At least fifteen minutes off .   
I ’m thinking we should go get a better vantage point , see if I ca n’t spot any troublemakers .
”
“ Watch out for my guys , ” I said .
“ Watch out for what ?
” I glanced at the door .   
“ Blame .
”
“
Got it , ” he said .   
“
I should n’t stick my neck out or draw attention to myself , then ?
”
“
Not unless I ’m there .
”
“
And where will you be ?
” he asked .
I looked at the other door .   
The one Fume Hood had taken .    
“ I was thinking I ’d get a glass of water .   
Unless you think that would be overstepping .
”
He looked in the direction Fume Hood had gone .   
His voice was soft as he said , “ I have no fucking idea .
”
“ I ’ll catch up with you , ” I said , clapping a hand on his shoulder in passing .
The area adjacent to the conference room was a kitchen , set up with multiple stovetops and long counters .   
Catering - focused , at a glance .   
The stoves were of different makes and models .   
Scavenged .
Fume Hood was standing by the sink , a glass of water in hand .   
She looked at me , her eyes barely visible with the surrounding mask and the overhanging hood .
“
Can I grab some water ?   
The bus ride was warm , even with the windows rolled down .
”
She filled a glass , then slid it along the counter to me , so it met me halfway as I made my approach .
“
What was the plan ?
” I asked .
“
The plan ?
”
“
Corporate ?   
Sponsored ?   
Ideology - driven ?   
There are a lot of those nowadays .   
Move forward , rebuild , hold to the past , unity in strength , religion …
”
“
No ideology , ” she said .   
“ No sponsorship .   
No business partnerships .   
I ’m not even sure what we would have done about the money .
”
“ That can be hard , ” I said .   
I drank my water .
“
It was n’t supposed to be easy .
”
I finished my water , then approached the sink to get more .   
Fume Hood turned around , leaning against the counter just beside me .
She said , “ It was community focused .   
Serving the area , hometown heroes like the old days .   
I thought of it as community service , in more than one way .
”
“ I like that , ” I said .
She shrugged .   
“
I ’m not sure if there ’s anything to like about it .
”
“
It ’s a good idea .   
It sounds positive .   
Maybe it ’s worth trying again later .
”
“
It wo n’t come together again like this later .   
Tempera is pretty good at this whole thing , and she needs to do the cape stuff , so she ’ll find a team to join .   
Crystalclear will get poached because decent thinker powers are in demand .   
Longscratch
…
I do n’t know why he ’s even here .   
Tempera suggested it to him , for some reason , he accepted for some reason .   
He ’s upset it fell apart .   
Next time , he ’ll just say no .   
He ’ll steer clear so he does n’t have reason to get upset again .
”
“ Mover psychology ?
” I asked .
“ I do n’t know about that stuff .   
I just know he ’s a weird mix of wants and needs
and he ’s really cool when things are good
and he ’s impossible to understand when they are n’t .   
Which they are n’t .
”
“
Sorry , ” I said .
“ You would n’t be sorry if you knew , ” she said .   
She stood taller , stretching a bit .   
She tossed the empty glass between her hands .   
“
It ’s my fault .
”
“
You orchestrated this ?
” I asked .
“
I hurt a pregnant lady
and she lost her child
and I do n’t even feel that bad about it , ” Fume Hood said .   
“
I turned myself in , but it was because people thought I ’d become a PR problem for capes in general .   
I ’d run out of friends and places to run to .   
It seemed like the only way to get things to cool down .
”
The glass smacked against each of her hands as she tossed it back and forth .
I drank my water , still watching her .
“ I ’m pissed , ” she said .   
“
People are making such a big deal over this , and I ca n’t bring myself to see it their way .   
It was an accident .   
I told the civilians to sit and stay put , and this stupid- ”
She stopped there , clenching her fist .
Fume Hood continued , “ -stupid fucking woman .   
She ran right to where I was shooting out a display window , gets knocked on her ass , breathes in the gas .
”
“ I wonder what she was thinking , ” I said .
“ I ’ve wondered that every day since .   
I ’m mostly caught between thinking she wanted to get hurt and lose the baby , it was so blatant , or that she thought the broken display window was an escape route , even though there were others she could have run for , ” Fume Hood said .   
“
I was so pissed .   
I shouted at people to take her outside and get her some fresh air , even though I knew it made everything harder with the robbery .   
They ’d contact authorities , we ’d have to protect ourselves , whatever .   
I thought I was pretty fair .   
She got medical attention and shit .
”
“ Could have been worse , ” I said .
“ I should n’t have pulled that robbery at the mall .   
I know that .   
But it ’s not one of my big regrets .   
Her being a stupid fucking idiot is n’t one of them either , obviously .
”
“ You turned yourself in after that .
”
“ The heat got too much , like I said .   
And-
and I was tired , you know ?
”
Her voice had cracked on the ‘ tired’ .
She sounded tired now .
“
It had been years , trying to get by .   
A lot of it was fun .   
The drugs , the robberies and mercenary work , the adventure , new places and really interesting people .   
Some shitty people , lots of scary people , but they were always interesting .   
Capes are interesting in a way you probably would n’t get if you did n’t know any for real .
”
“ I grew up with capes , ” I said .
She stopped passing the glass from hand to hand , holding it in both instead .   
“
Did you ?   
Huh .
” I shrugged .   
My glass was empty .   
I put it on the counter and , finger on the inside , spun it in a circle , the bottom rattling on the metal countertop .
She continued , “
Well , all I know is , the crime stuff started to feel like work .   
The drugs stopped feeling like they were a plus and started feeling like they were something I had to do .   
I was never addicted , I never craved it , I never had withdrawal after .   
This analogy I ’ve been thinking of is it ’s like I had to go to the bathroom every half hour
and who wants to do that , you know ?   
Who wants to keep interrupting their day for something they are n’t even enjoying anymore ?
”
“
No idea , ” I said .   
“
But I can see what you ’re saying .
”
“ The cool people started dropping away .   
A couple dead , others just stopped being cool .   
High people are really boring to be around .   
So like a genius , I thought hey , let ’s just go to prison .   
I made a deal .   
I wanted a bit of an education , training at some job or another , safety , I did n’t want to be stuck in there too long .
”
“
How ’d it work out ?
”
“
Deal worked out fine .   
Judge agreed , heroes agreed , it was one less parahuman on the streets that people were really upset about .   
Jail is n’t fun , but it was what I needed , I think .
”
“ Shows character , I think , ” I said .   
“
Realizing where you were at , where you were headed , and changing course .
”
“ I do n’t have character , ” Fume Hood said .   
“
It was selfish and self - centered .   
It was me , me , me ,
I ’m bored
, I ’m done with the drugs
, I ’m scared of being caught by angry people , I want this deal , I want some education .   
I do n’t
and I never cared about that pregnant idiot .
”
She met my eyes as she said that last bit .
Challenging me .
I spun the glass on the countertop again .   
“
The community service hero stuff ?
”
“
Me , me , me , ” she said , her voice quiet .   
“
I thought it gave me the best chance of dodging any lingering heat .   
Ha .
”
I took my finger away from the glass .   
It spun in a circle before settling with a rattle .
“ I do n’t buy it , ” I said .
She shrugged , tossing the glass into the air , catching it .
“
You said before that you have real regrets , ” I said .   
“
And you can call yourself selfish , but I think the dots connect here .   
Your reasons , your regrets .
”
She tossed the glass into the air , caught it .
She did it a few more times .
“ We should go , ” she said .   
“ Check on the others .   
Do our part .
”
“ We should , ” I said .
The water from the faucet we ’d used deposited a fat droplet on the metal bottom of the large sink , producing a hollow sound .   
Neither of us budged .
“ I got friends into the soft drugs and I egged them on instead of stopping them when they got themselves into the harder stuff .   
I regret that , I turned myself in for that , even though I was supposed to be serving the punishment for the pregnant woman .   
For other stuff , more on that level .   
I turned myself in for the ”
-she took a deep breath , as if to signify magnitude-
“ years of being a low to mid tier nusiance .   
For being tiresome .   
And because I was tired of it .
”
“
I ’m not a priest , ” I said .   
“
I do n’t have the power to say some words and absolve you .   
It ’s up to society to decide how angry they are and how they come to terms with it .   
It ’s up to you to decide how willing you are to face your deeds .   
When it comes to me … I can say I respect a lot of what you ’re saying .    
I definitely think you should own up more to what you did to that woman , stop calling her stupid .   
It ’s not a point in your favor .
”
Fume Hood nodded .
“
Honestly , ” I said , “ I really like the community hero idea .   
I ’d really like you to try it again , after a bit .   
For that to be your way of working through it all , from influencing your friends to hurting that woman .   
We ’re dealing with blame , not hate , and blame finds a place to roost eventually .   
There has to be another shot at making this happen .
”
“
Blame seems like too small a word for what Crystal was saying .
”
“ Blame can be big , ” I said .   
“ Blame has led to the ruin of nations .
” She nodded .   
“ That sort of helps , actually .
”
“
I ’m glad to have sort of helped .
”
“
Blame can become something else , given time , ca n’t it ?
” she asked .
“ It can , ” I admitted .   
“
I ’m spooked at the idea it will .   
For now , just … be a hero , ” I said .   
“ Do n’t walk away from this sort of thing for good .
”
“ You guys keep saying stuff to me , like , do n’t run off , do n’t sacrifice yourself , be a hero , as if it ’s implied I ’ve got ideas I have n’t said out loud .
”
“
You ’re a self - described shitty person and an ex - villain .   
We ’re not allowed to be suspicious ?
”
I asked .
That got a half - smile out of her .
“
Come on , ” I said .   
“
I ’m getting worried about my guys and I ’ll get yelled at by my boss if I leave them to their own devices for too long .
”
“
This is your thing , then ?
” she asked .   
She followed me as I left , setting her glass next to where I ’d left mine .   
“
You joined the junior - PRT to convince shitty people to be less shitty ?
”
“
On the most basic level , I got into this because capes are what I know , ” I said .
“
Because you grew up with them .
”
“
Yeah ,
but keep that under the lid for now , ”
I said .   
“
I ’m not broadcasting it to the world .
”
“ Lips zipped .
”
I pushed the door open , stepping back into the now - empty conference room .   
“ I want to help .   
I could have helped with construction or farming or whatever else , but like I said-
”
“ Capes are what you know .
”
“
Yeah .   
I knew so many great people
and I do n’t know if all of them made it , but I want to be in a position to help them through whatever comes next .   
I want to figure things out , because the lack of answers is what fucks us over , and fucks them over .   
I want to talk to people like you , if you happen to be on the fence , so maybe you land on the side where you ’re more likely to help out those really cool , great people .
”
“ I thought you junior - PRT kids were all about training
so you can go after the monsters .
”
She ’d created a hard green sphere , the size of a billiard ball .   
She tossed it between her hands as she had the glass .   
It smacked against each palm .
I answered her , “ Do n’t get me wrong , but I have pretty strong feelings when it comes to the monsters .   
I ’m pretty far from being okay with them .
”
She gave me a sidelong glance while opening the door to the main room .
“
But I do n’t think you ’re one of them , ” I said .   
“
Sorry , but you ’re safe from me .
”
She threw the ball to the right , but instead of smacking into her palm , it curved in the air , orbiting her hand in a long ellipse as a moon might a planet .
“
What a relief , ” she said .   
She was smiling a bit more , now .
The smile faltered a bit more as we faced the situation at hand .
Some of the police had come inside .   
My guys were standing near the windows , looking out .   
Some were talking to the police .
A share of the crowd had remained behind .   
Community leaders , possibly .
Fume Hood hung back as I approached them all .
“
You ’re in charge ?
” a police officer asked .   
He had a mustache .   
It bothered me , because I ’d never really got mustaches , barring the truly awesome ones .   
This was lip decoration , bristly and at odds with how his hair was combed back and close to his head .
“ Yessir .   
I ’m
Victoria , I take my orders from Instructor Gilpatrick at Wayfair High School .
”
“
They said you told them to follow our orders ?
”
“ Or to keep a lookout for trouble .   
There ’s still people here ?   
Is there a problem ?
”
“
No , ” the officer said .   
He sighed .   
“
I do n’t know what to do with them .   
Yours or with the others .   
Situation seems to be resolving itself , but the teenagers in uniform are insisting it is n’t .
”
“
The capes say it is n’t , ” I said .   
“
I ’d believe them .
”
“ Huh , ” he said .
I took a deep breath , exhaling slowly , while the officer took a look around at the situation .
“
Have n’t you talked to them ?
” I asked .   
“
The capes ?
”
“ A little bit , ” he said .   
“ Not recently .   
I do n’t really know how .
”
“
They ’re people , ” I said .   
“
Capable people who want to help .
”
“ They ’ve got the eye thing , and the masks .   
One does n’t have eyes at all , ” he said .   
“
He has these crystals .   
He pulled one out of the top of his head earlier , and it made a wet sound .   
It was in so deep it should ’ve been inside his brain .
”
“
They ’re people , ” I said , again .
“
It ’s disconcerting , ” the man said .
I wanted to say things to that , but I bit my tongue .   
I could hardly criticize when I ’d been talking to Fume Hood .
I ’d just-
I ’d really hoped for better .
“ If you need me to be a liason , let me know , ” I said .   
He did n’t give me an immediate response , so I called out to the squaddies .   
“ Get back from the windows , guys !   
The working theory is a bomb , heavy impact , cape power , or something like an earthquake , and you do n’t want your nose pressed against the glass when it comes !
”
They shuffled back .
“ Bomb ?
” the officer asked .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
Can you get everyone here clear of danger ?
”
“ To somewhere inside or further outside ?
” I looked around .   
Crystalclear and the others had n’t come to find us , so I was left to imagine the danger was n’t super imminent .   
Inside posed risks .
I did n’t like making the calls , but I said , “ Outside , but hurry it up .   
If there ’s any remaining crowd outside , get them further back or get them to go .
”
“
Alright , ” he said .   
“ Makes sense .
”
He whistled for the attention of his people and the crowd that had gathered closer to the front door .
While he handled that , I looked at the others , “
Where ’s Jasper ?
”
“ Still out there .   
He has Mar and Landon with him .   
The crowd is in their way .
”
I hurried to approach the window .   
I could hear a commotion behind me , as others entered the room , but my focus was on the commotion outside .   
My view was briefly blocked by the cops and the people they were leading outside and across the street to our left , away from both the building and the lingering protesters .
“ Victoria ,
” Crystalclear said , behind me .   
He was with a small few members of the community center staff , including the district rep , and he had Longscratch and Tempera with him .
He would be here because trouble was imminent .
“ How soon ?
” I asked .
“
Two impacts in a couple of minutes .   
Six or seven .
”
Two .   
Six or seven minutes gave us a window to act .
I watched the scene in progress through the window .   
Jasper would n’t make it to the front door in two or three minutes .   
Some of the protest had dispersed , but a lot of it had spread out from the square of grass , sidewalks , fountain and trees just in front of the community center , dotting the streets .   
A share of them occupied the street Jasper needed to come down to reach us , and a lot of them had their back to him .   
He honked , not for the first time , and one of them gave him the finger .
“
I ’m going to help Jasper out , get us our bus
so we can drive out of here without being mobbed ,
” I said .   
“ Is there a side door ?
”
Crystalclear pointed at what would have been the south side of the building , to my left .
“
Go there , stay clear of windows .   
Protect my people , keep them clear of danger .   
The moment there ’s real trouble , they ’re just high schoolers and should be treated as such .   
High
schoolers-
you guys protect Fume Hood .   
Protect the capes .   
Be good .
”
“ Do you need help ?
” Tempera asked .
She could n’t help .   
She would cause more problems than she fixed , being in costume .
No .   
I shook my head , heading to the front door .
Was this an emergency ?   
Yes .
Did I like using my power ?   
No .
I marched toward the bus , glaring at the first person in my way .   
I activated my aura .
“ Move , ” I said , and I pushed out with my power .   
Heads turned , noticing .   
Maybe they would put their finger on why they ’d noticed .   
Maybe not .   
I was nudging , here .
I could see the man ’s reaction .   
He took a partial step back .
I stepped it up a notch , not with more use of my power , but by raising the volume of my voice .   
“
Out of the way !
”
He got out of the way .   
That and me drawing nearer made it easier for the next person to come through .
“ Bus
! ” I called out to Jasper .   
“
Get moving !   
Side door to the right of the building !   
South side !
”
People looking back at the bus and back to me had more pressure to deal with .   
That was easier .   
They got clear of the bus’ path .
The one who had given Jasper the finger , though , he had just a little bit more to prove .   
I put my hands on him .   
I pushed him , and he resisted .
I pushed him with my aura , small , closer to center , a pulse of intimidation just for him , to break his posture and resolve .   
My hands pushed him the rest of the way .   
He landed on his ass .
He was n’t wholly out of the way , but Jasper was able to drive up on the sidewalk .   
His door was open and the stairs leading up to his seat were there .   
I hopped up , grabbing the bar that the driver used to climb into the seat , hanging off the side .
“
Things okay ?
” he asked .
“ They ’re about to be not okay , ” I said .   
“
We ’ve got four or five minutes , probably .   
I want to be gone
by-
”
Jasper ’s two passengers , Mar and Landon , were at the window behind
Jasper ’s seat .   
They were looking out and over my shoulder .
I turned to look .   
In the crowd , a man was standing there , shuddering .   
People were backing away from him .
He wore a black hooded sweatshirt and black pants , and he stood so the hood hid his face .   
His arms were at his side , vibrating .   
Head , arms , body and legs all moved like he had
a paint shaker wedged up his ass , moving more violently by the second .
Building up to something .
“ Take cover !
”
I shouted the words .
Some people did .   
They ran , they sprinted for mailboxes , for trees .   
But it was too open an area for everyone to find something .
I threw up my personal forcefield , shielding Jasper , my arm out toward the windows the other two were looking at .
The man in the crowd exploded , showering the crowd with chunks of bone , flesh , and a mist of blood .   
More than should have been contained in a human body .   
Some of the windows in the bus had cracked , and my forcefield was down .
The people over the square of grass , around the fountain , on the sidewalks and the streets surrounding the explosion all stood , calm .
Streaked with blood , they looked around , every single head turning left , then turning right .   
All in unison .
“ Drive , ”
I said .
Jasper stomped on the gas .
Further up the street , the cops that had been evacuating people from the building and across the road were standing near the street .   
They ’d been touched by the gore - explosion , and now they were drawing their guns .
“
Do n’t hit them !
”
“
I ’m not going to hit them !
”
Jasper called out , swerving so the side and then the rear of the bus was between us and them .
It had n’t been five or six minutes yet .   
It could n’t have been .   
The building had n’t been hit yet .
I climbed up higher , standing on the headrest of Jasper ’s seat to reach a higher point on the bus , looking over the roof .
Where ?
The worst possible location .
An eighteen wheeled logging truck was coming down the road .   
The front had been reinforced with metal braces .   
It was coming from the direction of the water , only four hundred or so feet of road between the waterline they ’d started near and the community center , but it was going full speed , straight for the side door .
“
Fuck me .
”   
Jasper ’s voice .
Even if Crystalclear saw-
“
Hit it !
”
I called out .
“
What ?   
Are you insane ?
”
“
Hit it !   
The others are waiting on the other side of the door !
”
I scrambled to get in position .
“
Trusting you , ” Jasper said , and the bus picked up speed .
You should n’t , I thought .
I had one partial glimpse of the inside of the truck .
Multiple costumes .








There was no way to process the series of collisions that followed me hurling myself down between the logging truck and the school bus .   
My focus was on deflecting the impact , clawing at the logging truck with everything I had to try to put it off course , before the bus made contact and hopefully moved it further .   
As the two vehicles came together , I extended my whole body , trying to push them apart in a way that would keep the collision from being the head - on sort that might kill Jasper .
In no particular order , the school bus hit the logging truck , the logging truck    hit the school bus and the wall , and I , my forcefields down , hit the ground rolling .
I came to a stop and lay where I was , face down .   
I felt the sting of the scrapes where I ’d come into contact with the road , and waited for the real pain to start .   
I wanted to know where the real damage was before I moved the wrong part and made it worse .   
My ears rang from the sharp noises and impacts .   
Playing dead helped , too , because the villains were rousing , opening the door of the truck cab , glass tinkling down to the street below .
“
What the hell ?
” someone asked .   
They were younger- probably teenager .   
I could n’t pinpoint if they were male or female .
“
Are you okay ?
” a deeper voice asked .   
The nature of the voice made me think brute .   
“
Any injuries ?
”
“ I think I have whiplash , ” the teenager said .   
“
I was n’t expecting that .   
What the hell ?
”
“ You were intercepted before impact .   
It looks like teenagers in uniform .   
With a bus .
”
“
I can see that , ” the teenager said .
“ You missed the side door you were supposed to drive through .
”
“ I can see that too , ” the teenager said .
“ I ca n’t tell what you ’re looking at , Blindside .   
Let me know if you need help .   
Snag ?
”
“
I ’m fine , ” was the response , a rasp .   
I heard metal creak .
“
Your arm is n’t , ” the teenager said .   
They would be Blindside , going by what the Brute had said .
“
I ’m fine .
”
I heard the sound of someone hopping down to land on the street , not all that far away from me .   
Metal struck the road shortly after .
I only saw a glimpse of him .   
Work boots , a long coat that hung down low enough that it almost looked like his legs were only two feet long , and arms long enough that his wrists made contact with the ground .   
The hands rested flat on the road , fingers splayed .   
He wore gauntlets .
I wanted to see something more than just his feet , but as I started to raise my eyes , looking through the hair that had come loose from my braid , my eyes were forced down , until they were staring at the road .   
I heard the scrape of another person
’s feet as they climbed down from the truck to the street .
“
My fucking neck , ” Blindside said .   
The person in question .
Try as I might , I could n’t look at them .   
My eyes and head refused to cooperate and do what was necessary to put them in my field of vision .
“
Do n’t complain , ” said the Brute .
“
You were n’t on the truck .   
You do n’t get to tell me what I can or ca n’t complain about .   
Fuck , I was n’t expecting that hit .   
Did both K.C. and Nursery fuck up ?
”
“
The timing was wrong , ” a woman said .   
Nursery , I assumed .
There were so many of them .   
The Brute , Snag , Blindside , Nursery , and K.C.-
I really hoped that K.C. was the mass - master I ’d seen in the crowd .   
If they were n’t , then there were six of them in total .   
Six and the crowd that the exploding parahuman had control of .
We had four capes on the inside , me , and a bunch of high schoolers , some of whom had guns .   
None of whom , cape or student , that I wanted involved in this conflict .
The five or six attacking capes would n’t be attacking like this if they were n’t sure they could win .
“
Do n’t be stupid , ” Snag said , his voice a rough growl , volume raised .
He was n’t talking to me .   
He was directing that at Jasper and the other two .
Drive away , I thought , willing Jasper to think the same .   
Be okay , drive away .   
Leave me .
I heard the chugging of the bus , the battered engine protesting as the vehicle started to reverse , pulling away .
At the edge of my Blindside - limited field of vision , Snag ’s metal , long - fingered hand lifted from the ground .   
He leaped toward the bus without making the movements necessary to jump .   
I did n’t want to move my head and risk being seen just to see him land , but I heard the metal - on - metal sound , the impact of a heavy body on the hood .
Every set of eyes , mine excepted , had to be on him and the retreating bus .   
It was an opening , and it was an opening our side opted to use .   
The side door of the building opened without a sound .   
Fume Hood and Crystalclear were in the doorway .
Crystalclear threw a chunk of crystal at the ground , and the chunk passed through without sound or apparent impact .   
Fume Hood had six green orbs with her , all around her hand .   
She sent one out in the direction of the bus , then , a moment later , sent a second .   
Both exploded , off to one side .
Crystalclear ’s shot passed through walls .   
Tempera had let me know that .   
Apparently , it needed to pass through walls , or the ground in this case .   
He ’d thrown it into the ground , and a moment after Fume had released her two shots , both landing , Crystalclear ’s shot emerged from the ground , an explosion of vapor , glass splinters , and fragments of road .
One of the villains , the Brute , only laughed .
Fume Hood paused , her four orbs around her hand .   
Her head was turned so she could only see me with one eye-
Blindside ’s power was limiting them there .
Through the hair that had fallen over my face , I could see Fume Hood look at me .   
Making eye contact .
I could n’t see the villains , so I knew the action was risky .   
I had to hope they were more focused on her than on me .
I raised my head up and    motioned for her to go , moving one hand , swiping my fingers toward her .
The pattern was much the same as with her first shot .   
One shot , then firing the remaining three all at once .   
One to gauge how it would fly , then the rest to deliver the hit .
They slammed the door shut , just before the three near - simultaneous explosions .   
The detonations were small and sharp , and produced a wind that blew my hair away from my face .   
I held my breath .
The Brute laughed again .
I really did n’t want to pick a fight with four capes at once .   
The bus was gone , the door was shut .
“
This is going to slow us down , ” the Brute said .
“ You do n’t have to sound so happy about it , ” Blindside said .
The Brute chuckled , and climbed down from the roof of the truck , and in the doing , he put himself between me and Blindside .   
It blocked my view of Blindside , and it gave me a chance to get a glimpse of him .   
The ground smoked around where his boots touched pavement , and the smoke solidified into formations that looked like branches and twists of metal , all in an ashen white - grey .   
His entire body was made of the stuff , as if he wore armor made of white - grey bandages made solid and immobile by resin , all of the ends curling up and away from him in horns or branches .
I knew him , even just seeing his legs .   
Or I knew of him , to be precise .   
Yeah , based on what I knew of Fume Hood
’s group , they might be outclassed .
The big guy was the Lord of Loss .   
There were two ways a cape could go with a name like that .   
The most obvious was to fuck up just once , and forever after have people wondering out loud what he was thinking , taking a name like that .   
Being called a loser .
The other way was to succeed and ascend the name , to take that name and make it a title .   
The Lord of Loss had managed that .
He had been one of the villains in a big city on the West coast , and now he was one of the villains running a settlement on one of the corner worlds .   
Was it Earth - N ?   
Not far from here , if it was .   
He was n’t top tier , as capes went , but he was A - list .
He was a Brute with Breaker flavor .   
He cloaked himself in abstract forms , with a set selection .   
I knew one resembled a bird , which he would have been using to fly alongside the truck .   
He was versatile , big , strong , and his breaker power multiplied his efforts over time .   
That multiplication played into how he flew , how he grew , and back before Gold Morning , a few occasions where he ’d been able to slug away at a bank vault until he ’d torn it open , or even drag a smaller vault away with him .
He turned his attention toward me , turning around and approaching me as the others backed away from the cloud of gas .   
My chin jerked toward my chest as Blindside stepped out to the side , back in my field of view .
I would ’ve rather had just about anyone else step close enough for me to get my hands on them .   
It had to be the guy I could n’t take out of the fight .
“ Miss , ” Lord of Loss said .   
“
Are you injured ?
”
I could n’t pretend to be unconscious-
I ’d just moved because of Blindside .   
I settled for an inarticulate , small moan .
Lord of Loss knelt beside me .   
“
Can you walk ?
”
I shook my head , keeping the movement small .
“
Is it because your back is hurt ?   
Can you feel my hand , here ?
” he asked .
I felt his hand touch my knee .
I nodded , again , small .   
I screwed up my face , feigning more pain than I was in .
I did n’t like this .   
I did n’t like being so close to the guy
, I did n’t like the scrutiny , the eyes on me , the attention .   
I did n’t like being treated like I was an invalid .   
I did n’t like suppressing my forcefield and aura .
I did n’t like being still .
It was easier to keep my composure if I was moving , doing .
“ Blindside , ” Lord of Loss said .   
“ Watch her .
”
“
What ? ”
“ You were always going to be the lookout , with Kingdom Come helping .   
We stick to the plan .   
We ’re going in , we ’ll get our target , you ’ll be the lookout , and you ’ll look out for this junior soldier while you ’re at it .
”
“ Pain in the ass .
”
“ Plans change , ” Lord of Loss said .   
“
You ’ll learn that sooner or later .   
Our clients hired us to capture an ex - villain who made a bystander lose her child .   
I do n’t think they ’d be pleased if we let another bystander get hurt while we carry out the task .
”
“
Yeah , no , I get it .   
Just go .   
Let ’s get this over with .
”
“
Keep an eye out for the vehicle with the other soldiers .   
They drove in Kingdom ’s direction .   
If they ca n’t get through or around , they might come back .
”
“ I get it .   
It ’s fine .   
Go .   
I can handle my shit .
”
My eyes had closed , because it kept my head from being jerked around as Blindside kept compelling me to move to avoid seeing them , but I could tell when Lord of Loss moved away , as the bulk of his body ceased blocking the light of the sun above us .
“ Snag , ” Lord of Loss said .   
“
Any injury ?
”
I heard a cough .   
“
No . ”
“
Then go with Nursery , ” Lord of Loss said .   
He paused .   
“
Kingdom Come ?
”
Another pause .
“
It ’s time .   
Move in , ” Lord of Loss said .   
“
I ca n’t go inside ,
so I ’ll take the roof , I ’ll watch the other sides of the building , and do what I can to help .
”
I cracked my eyes open .   
Nursery and Snag were walking up to the door .   
Lord of Loss was breaking into pieces , his arms spreading out as the wispy smoke formed into the ‘ feathers’ of his wings .   
He was n’t fast at all as he started to flap , lifting off the ground .
That would be the downside of his breaker power .   
It let him hit harder every time he hit something , and that included the beats of wing against air , but it took time .
Still , it let him move in the direction of the roof .   
He paused , circling , as Snag raised one long arm and pushed at the door .   
White paint leaked around the doorframe .
Sealed shut .
“
This would be why I ’m here , ” Nursery said , her voice soft .   
She began humming , and it was a lullaby sort of hum .
A music box sort of chiming joined the humming .
“
Fuck that shit , ” Blindside said .   
I was the closest person to them as they stood somewhere near me .   
I lay near the butt end of the eighteen wheeler , which had its nose in the wall of the building .   
Nursery and Snag were at the door .   
I was n’t sure if Blindside was talking to me .
The humming seemed to be picked up elsewhere , and the music box noises intensified , with new notes and a higher tempo .   
The area near the door blurred .   
It was a window into another world , what had to be a pocket dimension , but for the most part it seemed unsure if it was our world or the pocket world .
An indoor setting , at a glance .   
Beds and walls that did n’t line up with things in our world .
I felt Blindside ’s hand on my neck .   
They felt for my pulse .
“ Asshole is invincible , and so he does n’t even think to get your gun from you .   
You ’re lying on it , ” Blindside said .   
“
If I roll you onto your back , will it kill you ?
”
It was a question I ’d heard variants of before , in a tone I ’d heard before .   
A tone from someone that did n’t really care about me .
We ’re going to roll you over now and check for sores .   
Is that alright ?
We ’re going to wash you now .   
Can you try to move this arm ?
Can I get you anything ?   
Would you like water , or something to eat ? 
 
Condescending , caring more about themselves , feigning concern or consideration .   
They just wanted to get on with their day .   
Even the ones that did care lost patience sometimes .   
Stubborn , aggressive people like me made it easy to lose patience .
I made myself be calm .   
I exhaled slowly , and the exhalation came out as a shudder .   
It was n’t because I was hurt , but because the memories were close to the surface .
Blindside eased me onto my back , then I felt them touch my gun .
My eyes snapped open .   
My arm lashed out , one swing , mindful that they were probably just a fragile human being .
I did n’t make contact .   
Muscles in my arm wrenched , seized , and cramped as the entire arm locked up , just in time to keep me from touching them .
“
Aha , ” Blindside said .
I felt them grip my gun hard .   
My initial fumble to grab the gun ran into the same problem .   
My hand hit an imaginary wall .
The gun had a buckle keeping it in the hip holster .   
They had n’t undone the buckle , and they were n’t able to pull the gun free before I jumped up to my feet , backing a short distance away .   
The hand pulled free .
I still could n’t see them .   
My head was turned to one side , I had a glare on my face , and I walked slowly , keeping track of them by keeping them at the very edge of my field of view .
I imagined I looked a little feral , pacing as I was , trying to track them with my other senses , being unable to make eye contact .
I moved my hand experimentally .   
I hit the wall .
I could n’t point at them , then .   
I could n’t hit them , based on my earlier issue .
“
What do they feed you shits ?
”
Blindside asked .   
“
You get thrown from a bus mid - impact and you have it in you to pull this ?   
I ’m impressed .
”
The dreamy blur was disappearing , the way in closing behind Nursery and Snag .   
The background humming and chiming was fading .
I hoped the others were retreating , finding a place in the building they could hunker down until help came .
“ Listen , ” Blindside said .   
“
I do n’t want trouble .   
I do n’t want to hurt a civilian .   
I ’m
keeping to the rules .   
Lie down , put your hands on your head , let me take the gun .   
I ’ll give it back when I ’m done .
”
“
You ’re going to kidnap Fume Hood .   
I ca n’t stand by and let that happen .
”
“
You ca n’t do anything about it , ” Blindside said .   
“
We ’re going to borrow them , then we ’ll be on our way .
”
“ Borrow ?   
You ’re giving her back after ?   
Unharmed ?
”
“
Yep .   
Mostly unharmed .   
The woman who lost her kid wants to have words with her .   
Shout at her , make her feel bad .   
She and some others paid a lot of money to make it happen .   
Then we drop her back off somewhere near here and drive off .
”
“
For that , you drive a truck into a building and traumatize a crowd ?
”
“ Intel said we were good to hit the building there , use that as our entry point .   
Scaring her was part of the deal , so was fucking her over , ” Blindside said .   
“
Stirring up the crowd , it does n’t affect us much .   
We live in one of the corners .   
For her , it keeps her from finding any success .
”
“ For the sake of the woman who lost her child ?
”
“
Yeah .
”
“
And she ’s personally going to shout at Fume Hood there ?
”
“ Fume Hood , Bad Apple , Horse Apple , Apple Cider , whatever you want to call her .   
Yeah .
” I nodded slowly .
“ Just lie down .   
Let it be .   
Give up the gun , stop fighting , we do our cape shit and you carry on with your day .   
Police are under our control , nearest capes are half an hour away .   
This is the way it is sometimes .
”
“
The files I got when I accepted this job said the woman in question died , ” I said .   
“
The pregnant lady who lost her child .
”
“
Really ?
” I nodded , my eyes still fixed on the ground , as close to Blindside as I could get .   
If they moved into my field of vision , a forced movement of my eye and head would let me know .
“
At Gold Morning .   
Her home address was one of the cities hit hard .   
No sign of her after the fact .   
Authorities investigated when the word about this attack first came up .   
Which leads me to think you ’re lying through your teeth .
”
“ People visit family , go out of town for work , have stays in the hospital …   
I ca n’t tell you how many times I ’ve talked to people who narrowly dodged being in the wrong place at that one critical time .
”
“ Stop , ” I said .   
“
I caught you in one lie , let ’s leave it at that .
”
Blindside fell silent .
I heard a scuff .   
My head turned - was allowed to turn- as Blindside moved around to my side .   
I backed away a few paces .
I heard Blindside stop moving .
“ Change your stance , ” Blindside said .
“
My stance ?
”
“ Your head is turned as far to the right as it can go .   
If I move to your right , the reflex is going to be to move your head further right .   
You could snap your neck .   
You ’d probably close your eyes first , but I ’d rather not risk it .
” I obliged , shifting where my shoulders were , so my left shoulder pointed at them .   
I was aware that it made it easier to circle behind me .
“
And raise your chin a bit .
”
“
Why ?
” I asked .
I heard the sound of Blindside moving too late .   
I reached out to block or catch the incoming attack , and hit the wall where I could n’t move my arm too far toward them .
Something swung at an angle that avoided my arm .   
I brought my forcefield up just in time for the thing to hit me on the chin .   
An uppercut with a blunt instrument that should have broken my jaw .
Before Blindside could recover or figure out what had happened , I went on the offense .   
I could n’t hit them with my hand , I could n’t point at them , but if I swung my hand at them , elbow jutting out- I felt muscles seize , locking up .   
Blindside caught my arm , pushing me in the direction I ’d already been going , and shoved me to the ground .   
Martial art .
The blunt instrument - I saw the tip of a metal bat- struck down toward my shin .
It rebounded off of the forcefield as the field came back .   
The metal sang .
“
Ah fucking hah , ” Blindside said .   
“
Fuck me .   
You ’re a cape .
”
I lurched to my feet , putting some distance between myself and them .
Elbows did n’t work either .
The muscles in my arm and shoulder twitched with the lingering strain or sprain that had gone with the interruption .
I backed away until my forcefield came back up .   
I drew in a deep breath .
“
You ’re full of surprises , ” Blindside said .
I undid a buckle and pulled my armored vest over my head in one smooth motion .
“
That ’s not very surprising though , ” they said .   
“
I can see where you ’re going with this .   
I ’ve been at this a few years .   
Some of the workarounds and tricks are getting old by now .
”
I shifted my grip
so I held the vest by the shoulder .
“
The bus is back .   
Are they capes in disguise too ?
”
The bus was back ?   
I could n’t see without looking past Blindside , and I did n’t want to lose my bearings .
They were watching then ?
Well , I imagined Blindside made it hard to watch .
I swung , using the vest as a bludgeon .   
My arm stopped , but the vest continued .
I felt hands against my back , gripping the back of my top .   
Another move , Judo or Aikido , stepping into arm ’s reach , too close for the vest to hit me , trusting their power to keep my arm from hitting them , and throwing me to the ground .
I used my forcefield , and I used its strength to arrest the movement , stopping myself .   
A bit of my flight .
With Blindside directly behind me , I drew my gun , and I turned to the right this time , swinging out with gun in hand .
“
Nope , ” Blindside said .   
“
That won’t- ” I dropped the vest , my hand going to my ear , and I fired the instant my arm stopped moving .   
I shot the stone wall of the community center eight times .
The volume of it was such that I only barely heard Blindside ’s exclamation of pain .   
My ears rang- but the gun had to have been right next to the villain mercenary ’s ear .
This was how I operated .   
Even if I was trying not to be too blatant with others watching .   
I was trying to consider more before I acted and took this route , moderating myself .
Shock .   
Shake them on a sensory level .
I stooped low to pick up the vest , then swung it as I had before .    
Blindside stumbled forward , much as they had before , into my reach , both forearms pressing against my back .
I ’d had to moderate my aura , back at the hospital .   
My mood darkened even thinking about that time , much as it had darkened when I saw myself in the mirror and remembered what I had been .
It took all I had to not let that darkness affect how I handled the aura .   
I ’d told myself , so many times , I wanted to be better .   
Regrets were n’t worth anything if I did n’t let them drive me to do it better in the future .
For two months my aura had been one of the only real communication tools that I had , that did n’t require rounds of blinking and interpretation , or fumbling at a special keyboard with hands that did n’t map to how my brain thought my body should move .   
I ’d had some practice with the nuance of it .
Blindside was pressing against my back , and my aura was stronger the closer people were to me .   
I controlled the aura
’s expression to keep it small and more concentrated .
Awe .   
Catch them on an emotional level .
Blindside stumbled back .
I spun around in the other direction , and bludgeoned them with the weight of my vest , using it like a flail .   
They bounced off of the logging truck and collapsed .
Destroy was my usual third step .   
I hoped I ’d held back enough .   
I ’d wanted to disable only , but it was hard to know my own strength .
“
You conscious ?
”
I asked the villain .   
My own voice sounded far away , distorted , hard to hear over the ringing .
I should have heard any response .   
I did n’t .   
Silence .
Blindside ’s power did n’t let me check their condition , visually or otherwise .
I bent over them , fumbling , tracing their outline with the back of my hand , and finding walls even there , somehow .   
I found their head , medium length hair , and tried to press the back of my hand against their ear .   
My arm muscles seized .
I tried to use my knuckles to get into the ear , since I could n’t use my fingertips without pointing or driving them toward Blindside , and I still hit the wall .
Blindside had been using something to communicate with others .   
If it was a walkie - talkie , phone , or earpiece , it was n’t anywhere I could access it .   
Blindside
’s power protected them .
The movement in the corner of my eye caught me off guard .   
The bus .   
The front corner was badly damaged , but it was chugging along somehow .   
I had n’t heard it approaching .   
Where the paint had been black , it had broken away , revealing some of the bright yellow paint that it had once had , when it had been a school bus .
Jasper was waving his arm out the window , pointing .   
I could hear his shouts , but the words were muted .
Incoming .
The villains would have heard the shots .
I looked up , and I saw Lord of Loss at the roof ’s edge .   
He ’d turned himself into something resembling a tree .   
A static emplacement , less able to move , but with roots that would extend into the building and secure his position so he could leverage his full strength .
He was growing by the second , smoke billowing out and solidifying into branching points .   
He might just have the reach to hit us down on the street level , big as he was .
There were two entry points that were n’t windows .   
Two courses of action stood out to me .   
The first was to simply fly to a window , abandon Jasper .   
I ’d lose my job , but I would have to trust they would leave and be safe while I did what I could to help Fume Hood .
But I had something I wanted to ask .
I motioned for them to come , to hurry .
There were two doors into the building that I knew about .   
The front door was no doubt seized by the mind - controlled army .   
The side door had been painted .   
I was n’t sure I wanted to tear my way in and find out that the paint was a problem .
I did n’t want to charge in , only to find that they were securing their retreat .   
They ’d be looking for trouble coming from either of the entrances after hearing the shots .
There might have been a third way in .
I ran toward the nose of the eighteen wheeled logging truck , and I climbed over the nose of it .   
It had collided with the wall , and it had done some damage .
Reaching up , I pulled at the damaged part overhead , and I leveraged the strength my forcefield provided to tear it away .   
I pushed at another part , widening the gap .
The bus parked so its nose was tucked into the corner between the nose of the logging truck and the wall .   
Jasper , Mar , and Landon climbed out of the bus .
“
Are you okay ?
”
Jasper asked .
I liked that it was the first thing he ’d asked .   
Gilpatrick ’s five pound of gun speech taken to heart .   
Less than five pounds of weaponry , more than fifteen pounds of protection , twenty five pounds of support and problem solving .   
Jasper ’s first thoughts were on the latter .   
Those were supposed to be the priorities , the ratios .
“
A bit of road rash , ” I said , examining my arms .   
“
Too much adrenaline to feel the pain .
”
Shadows shifted .   
Lord of Loss had decided to detach from the roof , and was pulling himself together enough to start climbing down .
“
Come on , ” I said .
We ducked in through the gap , into a staff washroom .   
I could n’t see the source of the water , but it pooled on the floor below .   
We passed through the door and into the hallway .
“
So you ’re a cape , ” Mar said .   
He ’d been the kid who ’d sat behind me on the bus and made smug insinuations about my name and background .
I gave him a dark look .   
It looked like Landon was on his side .
“
You ’ve got blood on your upper lip , ” Mar said .   
“
It looks like you ’ve got a mustache .
”
“ Fuck off , Mar , ” Jasper said .
I rubbed at my upper lip with the side of my hand , looking back to make sure Lord of Loss had n’t followed us .
I could hear the humming and the music box .   
Upstairs somewhere .   
I could hear people in the building .
“ Jasper , ” I said .
“
What ?
”
“ I have to ask .   
How much of this is setup ?
”
“ Setup ?
” Mar asked , incredulous .
“ I know I sound paranoid , ” I said .   
“
I know if there ’s a scenario or something , it ’s probably against the rules to ask or answer , but I need the honest truth here , no bullshit .
”
“ You sound really fucking paranoid , ” Mar said .   
“ Holy fuck , you capes are screwed up in the head .
”
“ Shut up , Mar , ” Jasper said .
“
Just answer , please , ” I said , my eyes fixed on the end of the hallway , watching for the mind - controlled soldiers .   
“ Gilpatrick set me up with a bunch of new soldiers
I do n’t know that he can somehow vouch for , he insisted on them , and he sent me into a situation that was liable to get messy .   
It does n’t make sense unless I somehow imagine I ’m being set up to fail .
”
“ Fuck me , ” Mar said .
“
It ’s not really setup , ” Jasper said .   
“ Gilpatrick explained before I left .
”
I nodded to myself .
“ They wanted to make sure you could be trusted .   
They thought they ’d stick you with some objective observers for three , four routine jobs , make sure you stuck to the rules , grade you , leave it at that .
”
Objective .   
I looked at Mar. Yeah .   
Right .
“
And if I did n’t accept the job ?   
If I ’d told Gilpatrick I did n’t want to do this patrol ?
”
“
He really thought you would , ” Jasper said .   
“
He told me that .   
He was a bit stuck , caught between superiors saying he had to make you or he could n’t keep you on , and thinking you would n’t .   
Then you said yes .
” I frowned .   
One impulse .   
One spur - of - the - moment decision .
Cause and effect .   
Every time I acted on impulse , bad things happened .   
Some of the worst things had happened .   
People around me got hurt .   
I got hurt .   
Two years in the hospital .
It was so much of why I ’d wanted to slow down .
“
I ’m
pretty fucking glad
you said yes , ” Jasper said .   
“
If it had been me in charge here I ’m pretty sure most of us would be dead already .
” I exhaled .   
Deep breaths .   
I could n’t fall into the mindset of dwelling on the past .
“
You ’re a good guy , Jasper .
”
“ I try , ” he said .
I paused , thinking for a moment , listening to the noises elsewhere in the building .
I glanced at Landon and Mar.
“
I ’m a good guy too , ” Mar said .
“ Stay put , ” I said , firm .
“ You ’re going alone ?
” Jasper asked .
“
Yeah .   
Just find a corner of the building to hole up in .   
Hide , be safe .
”
There was a balance to be struck .   
I wanted to think I ’d reasoned this through , as much as I could with the time constraint , the enemy no doubt closing in on the capes .   
It was too risky to bring these guys with .
Going alone .
“
Stay , ”
I said .   
“ Be safe .
”
I sprinted off , raising my forcefield for good measure .
I entered the kitchen by another door .   
Where I ’d talked with Fume Hood .
Something exploded overhead .
I looked up .
Vapor , shards of crystal .
A moment later , there were two more small explosions , one after another , in a line .
Crystal clear , Crystalclear .








I paused at one of the doors of the kitchen .  
I ’d come in one door and there were two more .  
One led to a hallway with people standing stationary at the end .  
Another led to the main room , where everyone had been seated before this had begun .
Crystalclear had n’t signaled me further , and I took that to mean I was supposed to pause or wait .  
People in the main room were moving around .  
I peered through a crack in the door to see if there was an opening , a break in the ranks I could use to slip through or get something done .
I saw the people Kingdom Come had controlled had settled in
, most finding seats in the folding chairs that had been set up throughout the room .   
Some stood around the side or sat with their backs to the wall .   
Others stood at the windows , watching outside .
The majority of the crowd was at rest .   
The ones who were n’t had guns drawn .   
The police officers were among them .
The officer with the sad mustache was at the front of the room , face streaked with blood .   
He was talking , and I could n’t see who he was talking to .
I listened to the conversation , two people talking against a faint background of a chorus of hums and music box sounds .
“ You want me to negotiate with terrorists , ” a woman said .
“ We want you to do what is best for your community , ” the police officer said , in a very different voice than he ’d used earlier .
“ By playing along ?
”
“
This started with civilians , it involves cape on cape violence , ” the officer said .   
“ If you cooperate , we ’ll pay for damage done , we ’ll extend our protection over your community in a way that keeps capes out of sight and mostly out of mind .
”
“ A protection racket ?
”
“ Not a racket .   
No money or expectations .   
We ’ll take the woman and we ’ll tell you what to do in order to smooth things over .
”
“ I do n’t understand why .   
What does this serve ?   
Fume Hood was upfront about her history .   
She wanted to serve her time in this way .
”
“ If we tell you why , will you cooperate ?
”
“ I ca n’t promise that , ” the woman said .   
I was assuming she was the District Rep.   
Why had she left the others ?
“
The City is like a pressure cooker .   
The pressure is mounting and has been for a while .   
Things inside are heating up and winter is fast approaching .   
A number of great thinkers seem to think we need to vent the-
”
“
Vent the pressure ?
” the District Rep asked .
“
Yes , ” the police officer said .   
“ The-
”
There was an explosion overhead .   
Another of Crystalclear ’s shots .   
Two more , leading from one corner of the room and away .
I looked at the crowd , and I saw the person closest to me staring at me .
Kingdom Come knew , he ’d seen .
“
We ’ll continue this conversation shortly .   
You ’ve got a cape with a gun inside the building .
”
I backed away .   
Crystalclear created more explosions close to the other door .   
The people who had been standing guard at the end of the hallway , probably .
I retreated , ducking behind a counter .
They entered the room simultaneously , doors banging against the wall .
I ducked down , staying behind cover .
“
You ’re the one who fought Blindside ?
” the one at the door asked .   
The police officer .
I remained silent .
“ I do n’t want to shed any blood that is n’t mine , ” he said .   
He was moving deeper into the room .   
I heard the door squeak , peeked , and saw the corner of it .   
It had been opened and was being held open .   
Another person ?
“
Alright , ” he said .
One of the issues of being a parahuman was that there was n’t a history to build on or a peerage to draw from .  
We had powers , yes .  
Some of those powers were similar to the powers others had , but there were almost always tricks and caveats , strengths one person had that another did n’t .  
I could n’t copy Alexandria ’s old tactics and style because my invincibility worked differently .  
Timing was so much more important to me .
I could be shot , if my timing was wrong , or if their timing was especially right .
A person like Jasper could take classes in martial arts and get lessons on the range , and he could use tools and draw on the experience of millions of others who had bodies that worked like his did , a set of capabilities that were virtually identical to his own .
There was only one Victoria Dallon with Victoria Dallon ’s powers .  
I had to lean heavily on my own experience .   
In exercising my abilities , there was a point beyond which I was the only person that could teach myself –
nobody resembled me closely enough to be an instructor in how to fight , how to process , or how to or pass on their experience .
But my own experience was a drawback if I was caught in the moment , where I had to rely on instinct but that instinct pointed me right back to my old ways .
These people were innocent .   
The officer , the others at the door .   
Maybe some had been protesters .   
Kingdom Come had no issue in using them , but I could n’t hurt his pawns .
He could have moved them as a group , but he did n’t .   
He moved like a chessmaster played chess .   
One person taking a new position , pausing , checking the area , then another person moving .   
The police officer in charge -chief or sheriff , I was n’t sure-    had stopped in the center of the room .   
Others were moving around the perimeter .
I caught a glimpse of one by the gun he was holding , and moved around the corner .   
They all moved the same way when they moved , pistols held up , gripped in two hands that were dotted in drops of drying blood , pointed at the ceiling .   
I saw the gun before I saw the rest of him .
The lullaby continued , faint and distant .   
It was n’t enough to obscure any scuffle I made .   
I did n’t want to make noise , and whatever the movies showed , it was hard to crawl around while wearing boots and be sure to not make any sound .
I did n’t like flying .   
I was n’t confident in it like I had been .   
Two years had passed in the hospital , and my sense of flight had been as disturbed as the movement of my arm or my attempts at vocalization .   
It was supposed to be back , but it was a muscle I had n’t exercised .
I wanted to fly , but it was tainted .
I raised myself off the ground , still hunched over , staying low enough that the counters would block me from sight , and used flight as much as light pushes on the sides of the cabinet to propel myself away from the advancing gunman .
I had other training to draw on that was n’t self - taught .   
There was what I ’d learned and absorbed from time with family , but that whole experience was so full of pitfalls I barely wanted to touch on it .
The Wards .   
I had n’t been with them for long .  
I ’d absorbed some things from Dean , because I lived the cape stuff and Dean was willing to teach it .   
I ’d studied up and I ’d taken the tests .   
I knew the numbers and the labels .   
I knew the approach formations for squads .   
Simple , making conflict with parahumans as textbook as possible , black ink on white paper , sans serif .
In fighting that perpetual battle of trying to think things through and still act in time , the classifications were a nice shortcut .   
Apply the label , assume what worked against most people of one classification , and if it clearly did n’t , it was still a starting point .
He was edging closer .
Kingdom Come was a breaker and a master .   
He had a toggled state that changed the rules as they pertained to him .   
Shake , blow up , and he was now a horde of people controlled by the bodily fluids on them .  
Masters were second highest priority as targets , breakers were targets that required timing , often hitting them when they were in the state that they were weakest .
Kingdom Come made that complicated by not giving me a body to target .
They were closing in .   
They ’d crossed the length of the room and if I had to guess , four of them were standing within fifteen feet of me , guns held high , where it would be that much harder for me to lunge for the weapon .   
He did n’t have perfect coordination of their movements , I had to assume , unless they were all doing the same thing , like when the crowd had turned their heads .
The old me would have dealt with this by blitzing them .   
Hit each hard , fast , before they had a chance to react .   
Some minor harm would have come to innocents , but the situation would be resolved .
The current me waited , staying silent , letting them get close .   
One to my left , one in the middle avenue of the kitchen , between the two rows of counter - islands , and one on the far right , furthest from me .
As I set my boot down on the floor , ready to move , Crystalclear volunteered his help .   
An explosion at the ceiling , a few feet behind the guy to my left .
He spun around , looking , and I took advantage , leaping over the counter , reaching for the gun he held aloft .   
I seized it and his hands , and pulled both to the ground , where the counters kept us out of sight of the other two .
They started to approach at a run , each around one end of the counter , so they ’d catch me on both sides , and Crystalclear offered another blast between me and them .   
It took out the light fixture above , and cast the corner of the room into shadow , illuminated by periodic sparks .
It gave me a moment
’s pause to think .   
I ignored the man I ’d brought to the ground , as I held his hands and the gun .   
I did n’t even need my strength- only leverage and my body weight .
I could n’t do anything to him that would put him down for good without risking hurting the real person .   
I could n’t do anything to Kingdom Come , as much as the rule for dealing with masters said I should .   
He did n’t have a material body .
I used a burst of strength and tore the gun from the one man
’s hands , sliding it along the floor
so it went under one of the appliances .   
I ’d gone high to go after the first one , so I went low as I went after the officer to my left , throwing myself around the counter , using a bit of flight to help keep up my speed as I went around the corner .
I tackled him to the ground , holding him as we went down to keep the impact from being too hard .   
I ’d managed to get one hand around his wrist , and as he pulled his other hand away , gripping the gun , I seized that wrist too .
That left one in the middle of the room , one unarmed and on the ground and no doubt climbing to his feet , and one coming around the corner , gun ready .
I flew , sliding the police officer along the floor .   
I twisted to hit the cabinet with my shoulder as we reached the end of the row .   
That would bruise tomorrow .   
I flew again , to move another direction , keeping away from the rest .
As we stopped , the officer had enough in the way of bearings to drop the gun .   
He drew his knee toward his chest , and then kicked the gun so it would slide on the kitchen floor .
Someone stepped through the doorway , stooping low and catching the gun in a way that would n’t have been possible if they had n’t had a greater awareness .
No , as much as he was a master in execution , he was also a breaker .   
I had to be sensible .   
It did n’t make sense to fight a breaker like this when he was in his breaker state .
I pushed the police chief away , and then , reorienting , I flew straight up , through the ceiling .   
I felt my forcefield go down , bracing myself in case I brushed up against any wiring .
Second floor .   
I checked my surroundings .   
None of Kingdom Come
’s people .   
The lullaby music was louder .   
The drones would arrive soon .   
I moved , hurrying down the hall .
I found the stairwell .   
I stepped into it , glancing down .   
No sign of an approach .
I peeled some of the metal away from the railing , stepped back into the hallway , and leveraged my strength to twist the metal around the door handle , to seal it shut .   
I knew there could be other stairwells , but at least this way I ’d hear them if they tried coming this way .
Covering my back .
Priorities .   
Blindside was as classic a stranger as I ’d ever dealt with .   
Out of action or out of consideration for now .
Lord of Loss was a brute .   
Textbook answer when faced with a brute was to ignore them as much as they allowed you to .   
It would take too much effort and it would take too much time when dealing with someone who could n’t be decisively dealt with .
I could remember studying the PRT paperwork with Dean , doing the quizzes .   
He ’d said the rule for brutes had an unofficial second part .   
That as much as you might try to put them off , they had a way of making you deal with them .
What had I said in response to that ?   
I was a brute on paper .
Had that been the study session we ’d had in my room ?   
Dean would have been leaning against a pile of pillows at the head of my bed , Lyo - Leo on his lap , while Dean pretended to have him read the answers .   
I ’d been sitting at the foot of the bed , papers and books strewn between us .   
Real homework and superhero stuff .
The door had been left open , at my dad
’s
insistence .   
One foot tucked under me , I ’d snuck my one foot across the bed until I could touch Dean ’s knee , trace my toe along his leg .   
Seeing if I could break his focus enough to make him mess up while reading aloud .
No , wait , that had been a few days after Dean had reminded me of the brute rule .   
I ’d been studying it with more interest because Dean was turning eighteen before long , and we were worried he ’d get moved to another city , even with his family situation being what it was .   
I ’d seriously been considering joining the Wards and then the Protectorate , so I could follow him .
But I ’d told my stuffed lion that he needed to remind Dean that brutes like me had a way of making you deal with them .   
They could only be ignored for so long .
Normally clever Dean had been at a loss for words .   
He ’d grabbed my toe and squeezed it .   
I ’d wiggled it in his hand .   
We ’d been familiar enough with each other that the silence that followed did n’t feel bad .   
Awkward in a good way , even .
He ’d , after a long pause , found the clever thing to say , but he ’d stumbled his way through it .   
It would be my pleasure .   
Pause .   
To deal with you .
It had n’t been long after that that we ’d had our first night together .   
It had taken two days of desperate attempts at coordinating schedules and patrols , for me to get out without family wanting to join me , for Dean to avoid the ‘ sidekick’ situation and go out in costume without a Protectorate member joining him .
My heart hurt , thinking of Dean .   
My knight in shining armor .
Still , I smiled as I remembered some of the emails we ’d exchanged , my hands resting on the metal I ’d used to lock the door .   
Dean , ever the gentleman , had wanted to negotiate and check everything , from my comfort levels about X , Y , and Z to how my personal forcefield would factor into our time together .
I ’d laughed at that , which had been the tip - off for Amy to realize something was up .   
She’d-
And I ’d gone and done it .   
Let my guard down , tripped over the stumbling block , stepped on the emotional landmine .   
There was only the hurt , now , none of the mixed , warm feeling that came from thinking about Dean .
I pushed it all out of mind .   
It was n’t the time for that anyway .   
I was prone to getting lost in thought , even though it sometimes felt like every path led to the same , regrettable destination .
Dry , deliberate classifications .   
Moving forward .   
Deep breaths , when my chest hurt enough that breathing was hard .   
Back to numbers and labels .   
Lord of Loss and Kingdom Come had to be ignored , but I could trust that Lord of Loss would come into the picture somewhere along the line .   
We still had to get out of here or deal with him .
Nursery was close enough for me to hear the hums and chimes .   
Shaker , clearly .   
Not dissimilar to Labyrinth from back in Brockton Bay .   
The rule for dealing with shakers was to avoid fighting them on their own turf .
Snag was changer or tinker , possibly striker .   
Those arms .   
He had something mover going on with how he ’d gone after the bus Jasper was driving .
Still , there might be another in play .
I ventured down the hallway , still feeling that ache in my chest , feeling acutely aware of my own body , the way clothes constrained me , reaffirmed me , yet every reaffirmation was a reminder that I needed that small reminder in the first place , and why .
My hand brushed against the wall as I walked .   
The closer to the north end of the building I got , the more of the lullaby I could hear .   
Multiple sources formed the humming , soft around the edges , each slightly out of sync with the others in a way that suggested they all came from different places .
I felt the texture of the wall change .   
Smoother .   
I felt and saw the difference in texture and color , respectively .   
Gray and dusty rose shades , as if seen through a filter .   
The wall had become a painted surface that felt as if it had been painted over many times , some droplets having run down the wall and set in place , ridges elsewhere where similar bumps had been painted over and become a faint rise .
I could hear her now .   
Nursery .   
A human ’s hum , joined by all the others .   
She was close .
Peering around the corner of the T - shaped junction , I did n’t see her , but I saw the change .   
Her turf , as it was .   
Dusty rose carpet , picture frames with simple things like animals and boats in grays , blacks , and pale pinks .   
A crib , white , covered with a quilt .
I stayed at the edges of it , going further down the hall rather than turning the corner and venturing into her realm .   
Only the wall to my right was affected .   
A baby carriage draped in a blanket was parked beside a small bookshelf that had been stacked with children ’s books and building blocks .   
The cloth stuck as if it had been taped down or the sheer amount of time it had been there had nearly fused it to the fabric of the carriage , producing a tearing sound reminiscent of Velcro .   
The carriage was empty , except for a vague oblong stain on the seat ’s back and the seat itself .
When I left it behind , though , I could tell that there was humming coming from that vicinity , one of the soft , vague hums in the grander chorus .
Fuck me .
Every five or ten feet , there were more .   
A car seat removed from the car , handle up , blanket over it .   
Another crib , a much - used blanket tangled in the mobile , a child ’s wagon .   
Toys , clocks , wall decorations , cardboard boxes stuffed of baby clothes , marked for ages zero to three .   
A rocking horse and more .
I was forced to venture further into it to get closer to the true sound ’s source .
I saw her .   
Nursery was a woman with an ankle - length dress , a shawl over her shoulders .   
She clutched the shawl and rocked from side to side , speaking the inarticulate sounds rather than humming .
Beside her was Snag .   
He was heavyset .   
Two hundred and fifty pounds , at least , possibly three hundred pounds , and he was n’t quite six feet tall .   
That mass was made even bulkier by his coat , which was fastened closed , draping down to his ankles , where his boots were .   
The sleeves had been modified to be longer , fitting the arms , which reached to the floor .
It was my first chance at seeing his face , though .   
He had long black hair and a thick beard , both in the loose heavy - metal take .   
His mask looked like he ’d taken handfuls of black clay and layered it over the skin his hair and beard did n’t cover .   
The mask created a kind of neanderthal brow with a permanent glare built into it ; the circles under his eyes were so dark it was hard to tell exactly where the eyeholes of the black clay mask started .   
It might have been thick rubber , melted to be in the crude shape needed , the texture left unrefined .
Nursery barely flinched as the door opened .   
Fume Hood stuck her head and arm out , and she fired three projectiles .   
One hit the slash of white paint that separated Nursery ’s realm from the door , exploding into a cloud of gas .   
Two hit near where Nursery and Snag were , going to pieces instead of exploding or producing gas .
The gas from the first shot expanded to fill the space between Nursery ’s pocket world and the door at the end of the hall .
“
Speed it up , ” Snag said .
Nursery turned his way .   
She wore a cloth mask with holes cut out for the eyes .   
The cloth had a floral print and was bound close to her neck with a series of chokers .   
She continued to mumble and hum , but she ’d stopped rocking in place .
“
Come on now , ” Snag growled .   
“
We ’re expecting trouble .
”
The humming stopped .   
The music box chimes that seemed to be plucking and pealing from the light fixtures and behind the walls grew noticeably quieter .
“
Every time I have to stop to respond to you , Snag , it slows us down .   
Be a good boy and be patient , trust us .   
We ’re making progress , even if you ca n’t see it .
”
“ If we get caught between the new player and Bad Apple
’s
team-
”
Nursery let go of her shawl to reach out , placing her hand flat on Snag ’s face , covering eyes , nose and mouth .   
He pulled back , and I ducked back behind the corner , so he would n’t catch a glimpse of me .
“
Hush , ”
she said .   
“
We ’re safe even if that happens .   
This is my sanctuary .
”
“ I will bite you if you touch my face again .
”
“
You ’re not as scary as you pretend to be , Snag .   
I know scary .   
You ’re just a man that ’s dressing up , ” Nursery said .   
She sounded gentle , calm even after being threatened .
“
Try me .
”
“
Please , hush , ” she said .   
“
Let me do my work .
”
“ If you take any longer , I ’m going to push for plan
B. ”
Nursery resumed humming .
No more feedback from Crystalclear .   
The group at the end of the hall were n’t doing much of anything .
More to the point , I was rather concerned that the area of the building I was in did n’t entirely map to the layout of the building that I ’d seen from the outside .   
There was just a little too much room to either side of Nursery and Snag .
“ Tell me the details , ” Snag said , his voice growl - like even when he was n’t threatening Nursery .   
He ’d walked a distance away from her and toward me .
A pause , long .   
Snag picked up a child ’s plush and threw it down the hall , bowling over a stack of thin hardcover books .
“
Well , it ’s taking plenty of time .   
So is Nursery , ” he said .   
“
What ’s Kingdom ’s status ?
”
Another pause .
“
At this stage I ’d settle for plan B , ” he said .   
“
I ’d pay for the property damage .
”
Pause .
“
They ’re trying to buy time
and it ’s working .   
Tell Blindside to hurry up .
”
Blindside .
I stood with my back to the wall , listening in .   
Crystalclear had n’t communicated , but I was n’t sure he could .   
Fume Hood and Tempera were n’t doing much but holding the fort and delaying .
Nursery continued humming , but she piqued the last hum with an inquisitive note .
“ Blindside faked being out .   
Should arrive soon .   
We ’ve got some details on our mystery guest .   
Dressed like one of the troopers I stashed in the room back there .   
Untouchable but still wary of being hit .   
Emotion control .
”
The humming stopped .
I expected Snag to complain .   
He did n’t .
I chanced a look around the corner .
Nursery had turned around .   
She faced me .   
Snag was gone .
I stepped out of cover , one hand on my gun , glancing around to see where Snag had disappeared to .
I was n’t supposed to fight a shaker in her domain .   
But here she was , standing with her hands clasped in front of her , defenseless .   
She was also the only thing standing between me and the room where Fume Hood was .
“
Let me through , ” I said .
“
No , ” she said .
I pushed out my aura , as hard as I could manage .
She did n’t flinch .   
It did n’t reach her .
That was what this was .   
Her sanctuary was a protection from shaker effects .   
She overrode everything by transplanting this screwed up baby decor into the area .
I wondered if I could hit her .   
I looked around for Snag and did n’t see him .
“ Wake up , ” she said .
“
What ?
” I asked .
“ Wake up , sweetie .
”
The crib , a little red wagon with blankets heaped over it , and a carriage nearby jumped , rattling as if something had moved within .
I heard wet sounds .   
Throughout the hazy altered space , the meaty squelching started to overtake the background hums .
I stopped in my tracks .
Things moved beneath the blankets .   
She still had n’t budged .
I turned around and ran .
Fuck this .
I got away as fast as my legs would take me .   
I hit the wall at the end of the hallway and stopped myself with my hands rather than slow down with my legs .   
I turned right and headed away , past more cribs , more strollers , baby seats and bouncy chairs , all draped in their blankets of varying types and quality .   
Some tipped over from the violence of the agitation .
Yeah ,
no , whatever it was she was doing , I was n’t going to mess with it .
There had to be other ways .
I escaped the area of Nursery ’s shaker effect , stepping back into ordinary community center hallway .   
I was in the opposite corner of the second floor from where I ’d started .
Looking out the window , I could see the shadows cast by Lord of Loss’ branches .   
Was it worth chancing flying outside , then flying into the room where Fume Hood was , when Lord of Loss could try hitting me or grabbing me ?
There was another stairwell at the end of the hall- one I had n’t sealed .
The door opposite it had something hanging on it .   
A gauntlet with clawed fingertips , the ‘ arm’ something electronic .   
The claw ’s
tips were embedded in the wood of doorframe and door both .
“ Hello ?
”
I called out .   
I glanced back to make sure Nursery and Snag had n’t followed me .
“
Do n’t touch the door !
” was the rushed response .
“
Who is it ?
” I asked .
“ Patrol from the high school , community center staff , ” the voice from the other side said .   
“
Do n’t touch the door .   
There ’s a bomb ! ”
“ I see it , ” I said .
“
They said they ’d disable it when they left .   
You said to stay safe , so we cooperated and let them lock us in .
”
“
That’s- that ’s good , ” I said .   
My heart was still pounding from Nursery ’s thing .   
I was pretty sure
Blindside was n’t around , because my senses were n’t being affected .   
“
We ’ll get this figured out .
”
I was n’t sure how .   
They had a shaker power to override Tempera and Fume Hood .   
Potentially Crystalclear and Longscratch as well , depending .   
They had Lord of Loss sequestering the outside and they had Nursery taking over the inside .
In the same moment I turned my thoughts to Snag and his disappearance , two mechanical arms stabbed out of the nearest wall as if the wall was paper .   
One hand caught me around the neck .   
The other across the face .   
I was slammed into the window , hard enough to shatter it and take out my forcefield .   
Glass tinkled onto my head , into my hair , and all around me .
Before I could get my bearings , he hauled me into the wall .   
My head cracked into the drywall and I felt it break with the impact .   
His hand gripped my mouth and the length of his long forearm caught me around the throat .
I put my hands on his arms , and I felt the whir as machinery kicked into life .
As someone with the ability to control emotions , I was supposed to be harder to read and affect .   
It was why I ’d deflected Crystalclear earlier .
It was why Dean and I had gotten along .   
Even why we ’d been possible .
Maybe that resistance came into play .   
Maybe it turned Snag ’s power from an emotional uppercut to a mere slap .   
Negative emotions poured into me like liquid from a syringe .








Snag ’s power hurt , and it hurt in a way that had nothing to do with shedding blood or breaking bones .   
Emotion .   
My body still reacted , my heart rate picking up , breathing choked , adrenaline churning , hormones shifting .   
My thoughts were scattered , thrusting me into a state where I could either only reel or I could grope for a position in familiar ground .
I did n’t want familiar .
Reeling meant trying not to think , letting it wash over me and through me , and not letting my thoughts go where the feelings pointed .   
It meant I still had a metal gauntlet on my face and a metal arm pulled against my throat , and I was handling the situation with instinct .   
Fight or flight .
Fight-
No .   
I only barely stopped myself .   
I ’d kill him if I fought .
Fly then .
I pushed out with my aura , hard .   
The flip side of my observation moments ago was true .   
I was supposed to be resistant to hits to my emotions because I could deliver those hits myself .   
Snag would be resistant to my aura for similar reasons .
He still let go , arms slipping back through the wall .   
I had a moment where I thought about grabbing one of his wrists as it passed me , and I hesitated a moment too long .
I backed away , staggering until I bumped into the window next to the broken one .   
My chest hurt as if I ’d had my heart ripped out , and thoughts of Dean flickered through my head .   
It was a continuation of my thoughts from earlier , one sample in a long , long series of thoughts I had n’t let myself finish over the past few months and years that the surge of emotion was now filling in and pushing to the surface .
It was loss , if I had to put a name to it .   
Nothing to do with the man on the roof .
It was me in the hospital , with Auntie Sarah and Crystal , not knowing what to say because Uncle Neil and Eric had just died .   
Crystal had been hurt too , and the place had been so busy and crowded that we ’d gathered in the small curtained enclosure where her hospital bed was .   
My mom had been gone , trying to get news on my dad ’s situation , and my sister-
It was going from that , the horrible feeling of helplessness and hopelessness , to hearing the curtain move .   
I ’d known it was n’t my mom
–
she ’d left only a minute ago .   
It was as if someone had taken a want , desire , even a need equal to what I ’d experienced in my childhood and early teens , when I ’d wanted to be a hero , when I ’d written letters to Santa and wished it during every birthday candle extinguishing and for every shooting star I ’d seen from when I was four to when I was fourteen , if someone had gathered all of that feeling and compressed it into a single , concentrated moment of wanting it to be Dean coming into the enclosure to give me a hug .   
And then not getting what I wanted .
The PRT staff member had come in to let me know Gallant had wanted to see me while there was still time .   
Dean had .
Heart ripped out of my chest , just like that , just like this feeling here .   
Losses , losses , fucking losses .   
That ambiguous fucking word they ’d used when they ’d delivered the mass report .   
Not deaths , not the ‘ downs’ that were injured just enough they were out of the fight , just losses because they ’d needed to be brief with the list of names so long .   
Dean ’s name had been on that list .
Where ?   
It had taken me three tries to get the word out .   
They ’d told me where , but I had n’t traveled    a straight line to get there .   
I ’d zig - zagged , from doctor to nurse to PRT staff .   
I ’d asked people who had no cause or reason to know , tried describing her .   
Asking , asking .   
Pleading .
Where was she ?   
Had they seen her ?   
Where was the last place anyone saw her ?   
I need-
Where ?   
I shook my head , trying to rattle my brain and get centered in the present .   
Where was Snag ?   
He ’d disappeared into the next room .   
I stepped forward , feeling unwieldy , and thrust my hand at the door , taking it off of the hinges , damaging the door
’s frame .   
Empty room .   
Nowhere to be found .
My hand shook from the emotion , extended out in front of me .   
I clenched it into a fist .
She ’d been nowhere to be found too .
I ’d arrived alone , no help to offer .   
Too late to say anything or hear anything from him .   
I ’d choked on my words when it came to saying something to his parents .   
There ’d been this feeling like I could n’t react the way I ’d wanted and needed to , because his parents were there and they were somehow maintaining their composure .   
Upset , yes , but they were wealthy and dignified enough they would do their crying in private .   
They had weathered their losses years before and it had been the same then , according to Dean .   
Now it was on Dean ’s behalf .
What options did that leave me ?   
Break down into hysterical sobbing and act like I was hurting more than his own family was ?   
It might have been dismissed as the drama of a teenager and I had n’t wanted that to be the final note on Dean and me , in their eyes , in the eyes of bystanders .
Like I imagined anyone in a relationship
did , I ’d wondered if we were in love , and then I ’d known we were in love , and I ’d grown close enough to him to wonder if he was a soulmate , dismissed the term just as easily as it had come up because it was silly and it did n’t matter either way , did it ?   
I ’d received my answer on the question as I ’d felt a part of me die during those long minutes of me trying and failing to say something to his family .
From that to home .   
Southwest end of the city , our house mostly untouched by the attack .   
To dad being ‘ impaired’ , mom ’s word , and mom being business as usual , emphasis on business , because that was how she dealt .
To … a family member acting like they ’d been replaced by a fucking pod person from another planet , gradually realizing that replacement had been a long time ago , and it was only now in context and crisis that I ’d seen the alien - ness clearly , in the then - present and in retrospect .
Painful , in its own way , to have nobody to turn to .   
The hurt had been there like a block of ice , melting too slowly when I had n’t had any warmth to reach out for , not any less cold as the water pooled .   
Not any less for the time that passed .   
Just … more ambient .
This was like that .   
Snag ’s emotional effect was temporary .   
The pain ebbed out , made my fingers feel numb and tingly , made it hard to breathe , and made me feel more physically weak and less coordinated than I should have been .
I stumbled a few steps , and reached out to touch the wall for support as I resumed moving , entering the room Snag had been in when he ’d punched his arms through the wall .   
It was reminiscent of a hotel room , but rustic enough it could have been a bed and breakfast .   
Two small beds , a bedside table , a desk , and a flatscreen television sitting on a dresser .
He had a mover classification , I was pretty sure .   
He ’d used a trick to jump after the bus .   
I made sure to look up , to avoid any ambush in case he jumped at me from the space between the top of the door and the ceiling .
The room was empty .
“ Snag ?
” I asked .
No response .
My emotions were jumping around as I bucked the worst of the effect .   
I wanted to have him to talk to , to pull me out of the mire of past feelings and into the present .   
It made for a wild , disturbed kind of familiarity , almost a longing , as distorted emotions tried to find reconciliation with my head .   
It ended up parsing him as if he was an old friend I was trying to reconnect with .   
The same kind of weird emotional fixations that made Stockholm syndrome a thing .   
Cult leaders and abusers used it .
When you had nothing , you groped for anything , even if it was the person who ’d brought you to that point .
I ’d reached out back then , too .   
I ’d turned to the Wards , because my mom had been the only person doing anything to keep New Wave in motion , the team had been falling apart , and I ’d needed something .   
Because the tests and briefings made me feel closer to Dean , reminded me of the study sessions .   
Because the first time I saw her after the Endbringer attack , Vista had hugged me , because Dean , and it meant something to me that there was someone else properly upset for him .
“
Guys , ” I said , loud enough to be heard in the next room .
“ Victoria ?   
Are you okay ?
” the voice was muffled .
I opened my mouth to respond .   
My failure to form words reminded me of talking to Dean ’s parents again .
I stopped myself , trying to focus and put myself in the present .   
I took a deep breath that shook a little on the way in and the way out .
“ Step back from the wall , ” I said .
“
Do n’t , ” was the immediate response .   
“
Do n’t touch the bomb .
”
“ I ’m not touching the bomb , ” I said .   
“ Get away from the door and the wall to the right of the door .
” Snag had felt secure enough to stick his arms through the wall and not jar the bomb too badly .
I ’d take his cue .
I put my arm through the wall , felt my forcefield go down .   
I heard the exclamations .   
Once I was sure I was good to move , I dragged it to one side , tearing a hole , felt one of the studs , moved it to the other side , and felt another .   
About two feet of clearance between the studs .
I saw the faces on the other side .   
Worried .   
Angry .
The window shattered .   
Snag reached through , seizing me by the throat .   
He swung by one arm outside the building , dragging his other arm through the windows and slats , shattering them with explosive force , as he drove me toward the wall opposite the hole I ’d just made .
I still had my forcefield up .   
He had n’t grabbed me that hard .   
Flight and forcefield together helped to stop me in my tracks .   
Floorboards shattered under me , and a window beside me broke as the force was transferred out .
Seizing his arm , I swung it like a bat , hurling him into the room .   
I maintained my grip on him as I did it .
He touched the ground with one foot , then changed trajectory .   
Dust fell from the ceiling as he landed on it , upside - down , his arm still extended my way .
I felt the machinery hum with activity , and tore the hand away , pushing it away from my throat and face .   
The emotion effect grazed me , minor , but I had n’t recovered from the last hit .
A small kind of loss , this .   
The hit did n’t do what the first had , rounding out a memory .   
It did buzz through other memories .   
Ones that were more minor , that I ’d never put to rest .
Being in the bus stop with my mom .   
Weird , because it had once been a happy memory .   
She ’d been stitching up a cut on my forehead while I suppressed my forcefield .   
The rain had been pouring , streaking the graffiti - covered walls of the bus stop .   
A moment for just my mom and me .   
She ’d paused midway through the first aid to tell me that she was proud of me .   
We ’d got the guy we were after .   
Then we had talked about how I ’d have to change my hair for a short while to hide the stitches .   
One of my first times officially out in costume .
It was a memory I kept going back to .   
One
I ’d brought up several times in the hospital .   
Bittersweet somehow , and it had become more bitter and less sweet over time .
It bothered me , brought me down just a bit , because it was something unresolved that had weighed on me , because I was already down a ways .
“ Stop , ” I said .   
I did n’t sound like myself .
His hands freed , he reached back to his boot with one gauntlet .
He threw a trio of fat shurikens at me .   
My forcefield blocked them , saw them bounce off , one landing on the bed , two falling to the floor beside me .
I kicked the bed to bring the more solid bedframe to where I could grab it , and rammed the end of the bed at the corner where he was .   
The shurikens detonated behind me , and on the bed in front of me .   
Something that was n’t fire or anything of the sort .   
Something jumped between them , like electricity but not .   
Where it touched me , my heart jumped , my mind stumbled , and feelings welled .
All of the doubts , fears , and hesitations inside me magnified , multiplied .   
It paralyzed me for the moment .
This , at least , was something I ’d been trying to get a handle on .   
Here , my resistance applied .
He ’d dropped down to the ground before the bed struck him , landing on both feet , arms spread out , hands planted on the ground .   
He sprung back using his mover power , landing with one hand and one boot near the ceiling and another hand and boot beneath and on the window as he clung to the wall .
With the damage I ’d done to the bed already by using it as a weapon , the swipe I used to get it out of my way destroyed it , only the mattress surviving .   
I still had to pick my way past a slat .
He seemed surprised that I was already moving .   
After pausing momentarily in shock , he used the moment of me navigating the wreckage of the bed to spring off to the right , down the hallway .
I passed through the doorway , pursuing , and my head turned against my will .   
I heard glass break , saw Snag vault through the window he ’d broken .
He was nimble , for a guy that big , but it seemed his mover power was responsible for most of it , his mechanical arms only helping with the legwork .   
He was strong in many respects for what I was gathering was a multi - trigger .   
Robust tinkerings , what felt like a full - fledged emotion affecting ability , a decent mover power .
My attention was more on the other two further down the hallway .   
Blindside , I assumed , and a hint of the pink and grey coloring to the carpet that might have been Nursery .
Blindside ’s bat tinked against a solid surface as they loitered there .
“
Damn
it , Snag , ” Blindside muttered .   
“ Running off and leaving us with this ?
”
“
He ’s a character , ” Nursery said .
“
You ’re a character , ” Blindside said .
I could hear wet slurping sounds
and I could n’t see what was making them because Blindside was standing close to Nursery .
“
Stop this , ” I said .   
“
It does n’t end anyplace good .
”
I did n’t hear the response , because Snag reached up through the floorboards , seized my leg , and hauled me halfway through the floor .   
I might have gone further , but I braced myself with flight and forcefield .
It left me kneeling with one leg , the other stuck straight out and down through the floor , my hands on the ground in front of me .
I heard Blindside
’s running approach .
Bat in hand , probably .   
I pushed out with my aura , hoping to give them a reason to think twice , buy myself a second .
Lurching to my feet , I brought Snag ’s arm up above the ground .   
I reached down to grab his hand , and then kicked nearer to the elbow .
The mechanical arm broke off .   
With a bat of my own , I shifted my grip to the wrist rather than the now - limp hand , and held my weapon out , waving the broken end of the arm in Blindside
’s general direction .
No blood .   
I ’d broken it off far enough down .   
That was good .
I was breathing hard , my heart was racing , and old wounds felt fresh again , but I was finding some equilibrium again .   
I-
The arm I was holding self - destructed , or the emotional battery within it did .   
It stayed in one piece and it dashed me to pieces .
Again , the ripped - out heart feeling .   
Again , the heavy sense of despair .   
Deeper - seated now , because I had n’t recovered entirely from either of the other two hits , the big one and the graze .
I saw double , more than double .
Months and years of seeing double .   
One eye on the computer screen beside me , watching the time , looking for chat notifications .   
One eye on the television .   
One eye on the door .
Twenty past two .   
Fifteen minutes late .   
I counted the minutes .   
Twenty one past two .
Twenty two past two .   
The sound from the television was almost abrasive , made to be attention - getting .
I wanted to say something , protest , and I did n’t have a voice .   
The computer was in arm
’s reach , but it was a herculean effort to get a message out .
The door opening and the wrong person being on the other side .   
Just like with Dean .   
It was n’t the staff member who came on weekdays at two - oh - five when I had visitors .   
It was someone else , with a face I knew , a name I did n’t , and a gentle voice that was telling me that another patient was throwing a tantrum and the facility was on lockdown , they had contacted my visitors .
My visitors , my family , had decided that because they did n’t know how long the lockdown would be , they would come another day .   
It was a long trip .
I reached for the laptop , started to type out my message for the text - to - speech speaker , using keys that were oversized and spaced out , with screwholes in the middle of each key for knobs and joysticks to be screwed in for when other patients had their turn .   
It was supposed to double as physical therapy for me , coordinating myself , making the effort to reach and reposition .
The staff member had apologized , then turned to go notify other patients , closing the door behind her .   
I ’d tried to vocalize and of course I ’d failed .   
It was too long and byzantine a way from lung to mouth .
The message had been left unfinished on my screen , only a few words of what I ’d wanted to say .   
Even completed , the statement would n’t have meant anything to the staff member , and they would n’t be able to do anything about it .   
All I ’d wanted to express was that my family had missed the last two visiting days as well .
My eye had found the clock on the laptop , noted the ‘ F’ .   
Friday .
One eye on the clock , watching the minutes .   
One eye on the television .   
One eye on the F , counting the days to Monday .   
One eye for the email icon on the computer screen , waiting for the apology email that would come .   
When it did , I would check the time , comparing it to other apology emails , to try and figure out if they were getting further apart , less .   
To see if they would stop entirely , a prelude to the visits ceasing altogether , because it was easier to forget me than to do otherwise .
Something inside of me had broken at that .   
I ’d known it would cost me privileges .   
Maybe even visits .   
I ’d known it would hamper or hurt other patients and staff across the hospital .   
Ones who did n’t deserve it .
But I had nothing else .
I ’d pushed out with my aura , as hard as I could , as far as I could .
I pushed out with my aura , as hard as I could , as far as I could .
Things had been happening while I was elsewhere .   
The building shook .   
The villains were gone .
“ Victoria ! ”
Jasper .
He was with others .   
I barely recognized them .   
The heroes in particular took me a second .   
The kid who looked a little bit flamboyant , hair gelled back , wearing what was almost a crop top
, a beast ’s upper face with fangs pointing down at his chest , the lower jaw and fangs on the belt , with diagonal slashes worked into either side of both parts of the icon , painted on his abs in a faint color that might have been missed in dimmer light .   
Tempera with more of the white paint on her , a bit of blood .   
Fume Hood was using one hand to press a bandage to her shoulder .   
Crystalclear was missing more than a few chunks from his head .   
One of his eyes was exposed now , peering from between one chunk that grew from the bridge of his nose and one that grew from his temple , very blue .
They looked frightened of me .
That was what my aura did , really .   
Another of those contextual emotional things , like the Stockholm syndrome .   
Awe and admiration if they liked me , fear if they did n’t .
Just fear , here .
“ S - stop .
”
Not my voice this time .   
Jasper ’s .
I stopped .
I trembled as I made myself get back to my feet .   
I wiped my cheeks where they were wet .   
My hair was a mess from being thrown around .   
I used numb fingers to pry at it , undoing the tie .
“ Christ , ” Mar said .
For the first time , Jasper did n’t shut him up .
The building shook .   
Daylight reached parts of the indoors it was n’t supposed to .   
This would be their plan B.    Property damage indeed .   
Lord of Loss was tearing off the roof .
“ We need to go , ” Tempera said .
I nodded .   
I looked back for the hole I ’d made .   
I saw the teenagers in uniform in the trashed room .   
They ’d opened the hole the rest of the way and filed out .   
Now they stood as far away from me as the room ’s boundaries allowed .
They would have seen me throw the bed .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
My voice sounded hollow .
The partial uniform I wore , still without the vest that I ’d left outside , dusty    blood - spotted , it did n’t fit me anymore .   
I felt choked by it , because I knew I ’d just lost my job .
I led the way down the stairs .   
I stumbled in one place where a trace of Nursery ’s effect made the stair a different shape , carpeted when it should n’t have been .   
Flight helped keep me from sprawling .
“
You ’re Glory Girl , ” Landon said .
I ’m not , I thought .
“
People said you died when the Slaughterhouse Nine attacked Brockton Bay back in twenty - eleven .
”
“ Landon , ” Jasper said .   
One word .
The people who had been gathered inside were evacuating .   
Kingdom Come was n’t making it easy , either .   
As they reached a safe distance , near where people had been protesting , they were gathering in offset rows , so we would have to move diagonally or zig - zag through their ranks to get past them .   
A fence .
It was hard to tell what the villains were doing when Blindside was part of the group and they were already distant , but I could turn my head and see a bit of them out of the corner of one eye .   
They were backing up , moving away without actually fleeing the scene .   
Nursery was creating her effect .
The kids I ’d brought with me were backing away , putting themselves    a distance away from us .
I looked up for the branches overhead and I did n’t see them .
“ Watch out for Lord of Loss , ” Tempera said , following my line of sight .
Where was he ?
“
He ’s up there , ” Crystalclear said .   
“
He ’s changing .   
Centaur ?
”
“
That ’s his combat form , ” I said .   
I still did n’t sound like myself .   
“ One of them .   
It ’s mobile .
”
“
I ’ll keep the others busy , ” Longscratch said .   
He swiped one of the weapons he held , the buckler with the three swords mounted on the back , and three deep furrows appeared on the ground , stretching out beneath the feet of the crowd .
“
Wait , ” Tempera said .
Longscratch flickered , appearing momentarily at two of the points on the far side of the crowd where the furrows ended , before finalizing at the third .
“
Help him , ” she told Crystalclear , touching his shoulder , leaving white fingerprints .   
“ Fume Hood , stay close .   
They ’re still targeting you .
”
Tempera moved her hand , and deposited what looked like fifty gallons of the white paint with black edges on the street .    
We spread out as it appeared .   
She moved her fingers , and it spread out .
“
Tempe !
” Crystalclear shouted .   
He extended one hand out to the side , pointing .
The paint moved , a tidal wave , leaving a streak where it went .
I chased it .
Lord of Loss leaped from the rooftop .   
Ten feet tall , a centaur in vague shape only .   
His lower body looked more rhino - like , though the legs were longer , and he was plated in those same straps that looked like twists of smoke frozen in place , or wispy bands of metal that peeled away from him at the end .   
He carried a heavy shield on one side , cut in a way that let its bottom left edge rest against the shoulder of his foreleg when he held it tilted forward , and he carried a heavy lance in the other hand .
His face was a helmet , the slits for the eyes and lower face were closed up , so the face was only a series of ridges where bands met and poked out , Y - shaped .   
His hair was a mane of bands left to flow like smoke .
He landed in the streak of Tempera ’s paint , and he lost traction , falling to one side .
The paint rose up and over him , then solidified .   
He shattered it , lurched to his feet .   
The paint liquified and rose up and over his legs , and he shattered it again .
Was it more easily than he ’d shattered it the first time ?
Actions he repeated were supposed to be stronger .
To give Tempera a hand , I threw myself forward at Lord of Loss .   
Flight , forcefield up .   
He twisted around and raised the shield , blocking me .   
I still hit him hard enough to cost him footing .   
Paint covered him , hardened .
He broke the paint , swung his lance around , hitting me with the broad side .
Forcefield down , impact dampened but not entirely broken .   
I hit the ground and it hurt .
He broke through the paint yet again , found his feet , hit me again , this time while my feet were planted on the ground .   
My forcefield came back up just in time to be broken again .
Yeah , that hit had been harder .
Fume Hood shot him , hit him in the face .   
The paint crawled up to his upper body and joints , hardened there , trying to limit his movement , and he broke it again .
He laughed .   
Then he hit me again .   
I deflected the hit , swatting at his lance with one hand .
He was advancing , pressing closer to Fume Hood , and as much as I retreated , as much as I was sure Fume Hood was backing up , he had longer legs .
When he hit me yet again , pavement cracked beneath me , around my feet , the forcefield pushing the impact out and around me .   
I almost lost my step backing away , with the cracked ground .
Each hit stronger than the last by a significant margin .
This was the point I was supposed to throw my hands up and surrender , or get out of the way .   
If he decided to hit me more frequently , or if he lurched forward and kicked me with one of those feet of his after swatting me with his lance-
Crystalclear had turned around , was using his blasts on Lord of Loss now .
Loss , losses , losses , losses .
I threw myself forward , flying , seizing him by one leg , twisting , trying to knock him over .
I got him off balance , and then he hit me .   
Only a moment of me holding onto him kept me from getting smacked into the ground with no forcefield .   
I fell to the ground and scrambled out of the way of his legs .
I waited until my forcefield was back , then threw myself at him , bowling him over .   
I tore at strips , peeling away at him .
In the background , Kingdom Come had abandoned his control over the crowd .   
They woke as if from a deep sleep , and they seemed surprised by what was happening around them .   
They fled .   
Away from the brutes fighting , away from the chaos and the damaged building .
He elbowed me .   
It took him long enough to rise to his feet again that I was able to get in front of him again .
I could do this .
I needed to do this .
It-
It was n’t my day to get what I wanted .   
I barely registered the sound .   
A crack , coinciding with the noise of the crowd .   
Lord of Loss went still .
My back had been turned , so I had n’t been in a position to see it .
One bullet , from somewhere nearby .   
Fume Hood on the ground , Tempera beside her .
It was n’t my day to get what I wanted .
I ’d frozen .   
A lot of people had .
“ Go to her , ” Lord of Loss said .   
“ Help .   
I ’ll let you go if you let us go .
”
Numb , I nodded .
“
Let people know it was n’t us .   
This was n’t our plan , ” he said , behind me .
I flew as much as I walked , and dropped to my knees at Fume Hood
’s side .   
I put my forcefield up , tried to position myself where I could be a wall for her .
“ Put your hands here , ” Tempera told me .
I did , pressing down on the stomach wound .   
Blood pooled out , covering the backs of my hands .
The crowd had gone still .   
There was a murmuring , and people were drawing closer to watch and to see .
Reminiscent of Vikare .
In the background , Longscratch and Crystalclear had already apprehended the suspect .   
A protester that had been in a building nearby .   
Hunting rifle .   
The villains were leaving .
“
Not-
”
Fume Hood grunted .
“
Not ?
” I asked .
“
Not a good day , ” she muttered , through gasps .
“
No , ” I agreed .   
Very much agreed .
Landon had come closer , and was helping by getting the first aid kit out .   
Tempera took the components .








The sun was just starting to set when the police were wrapping up with us .   
They ’d had to arrive first , of course , the ones who had been on the scene were compromised , victims as much as anything .
Nobody Kingdom Come had affected remembered much of anything .   
It was as though they ’d fallen asleep –
they remembered losing awareness ,
some reported briefly coming to in the middle of things as the building had shook or they had been knocked around , and they had n’t really processed or understood much of those glimmers .
A few had reported me as a recurring image .
There was some concern that Kingdom Come might have absconded with someone or that not everyone that had been in the crowd was accounted for , but from what I could tell , it had been an all or nothing thing .   
People remembered coming to , many of them dangerously close to a superhero fight in progress , but the recollections were hazy .
I sat on the sidewalk near the front door of the community center , aware that it was very late in the day .   
The sky was orange - yellow now , with darkness on the eastern horizon .   
The thickest parts of the clouds overhead were cast in shadow , zig - zags of darkness through the amber .
The heat of the day was subsiding , helped by the cloud cover .   
Dust and sweat had left my arms mottled with grime and tracks where sweat had wiped it away .   
I ’d washed my hands after helping Fume Hood , and I ’d realized I had n’t gotten all of Tempera ’s paint and the blood on the backs of my hands .   
I was painfully conscious of the sweat , grime and blood , yet I could n’t bring myself to go wash up because that would require attention to it .
Paradoxical , I was well aware .
I turned my attention back to the kids .   
Making sure they were okay .   
At some point where I had been lost in thought , Gilpatrick had showed up .   
I watched until he glanced my way .   
He raised a hand , and I raised mine .   
Then he turned his attention back to the teenagers .   
As it should be .
I ’d figured I would be working late .   
I ’d just thought it would be paperwork and talking to the students .   
I ’d really liked that part .   
It was fascinating stuff when it was n’t so close to home .
I could relax some , seeing Gilpatrick .   
Not because it meant great things , but because it meant I did n’t have to think about finding Gil after , getting the details , putting off hearing the news or delivering the essential details .
I put my hands behind me where I would n’t see the blood or the places where the paint had settled into the cracks , oil - black , and I leaned back , eyes closed , trying to focus on the voices and the sounds , on the breezy wind and the ambient warmth .
“
I ’m sorry ,
” Gilpatrick said .   
He ’d approached me .
I kept my eyes closed .   
I said , “ Are the students okay ?   
The others ?
”
“ They ’re fine .   
Some have parents here , I ’ve got a bus coming for the others .   
Psychologically , emotionally , I do n’t know .   
It was scary and it was hard to know what was happening .   
The staff of the community center are obviously upset about the building , but that ’s not on us .
”
I opened my eyes .
Gilpatrick was n’t wearing his vest .   
A sleeveless undershirt tucked into black pants , a sweatshirt slung over one shoulder .   
Bald , bushy eyebrows , hairy , hairy arms .
“
Jasper filled me in on most of it , ” he said .   
“
He ’s reliable when it counts , it seems .
”
“
He ’s a good guy , ” I agreed .   
“
There ’s a reason I wanted him with me .
”
“ I get it now , I think .
”
“ If you want this project to be a positive thing , at least at our school , you ’ll want more Jaspers .   
You wanted a verdict on the kids you sent with me ?   
I would n’t put them in leadership roles .   
Not if there are going to be capes on scene .   
What I heard and saw was n’t very positive , and if there were any who disagreed , they did n’t feel confident enough to say it out loud .
”
Gilpatrick ran his hand over the skin of his head , not giving me a response .
My arms were tired from propping myself up .   
I leaned forward instead .
“
Alright .   
Thanks .   
Not good to hear , but I appreciate it , ” he said .   
“
I ’ll take that under serious advisement .
”
“
They follow orders , at least .
”
“ I was really hoping to have more hands to help out , ” he said .   
“ Really unfortunate .
”
Some parents were joining students who were talking to the police .   
I watched them .   
Parent and child side by side , parents concerned as they listened , getting the details at the same time the officers were .
“ I am sorry this happened , ” Gilpatrick said .   
“
I meant it when I said it .   
I mean it now .
”
“ I gave my point - by - point retelling of events to the police , ” I said .   
I stared at my hands .   
“
Including the part where I was hit by a few emotion - affecting attacks .   
It ’ll take some of the responsibility off your shoulders , if anyone asks .
”
“
It ’s not that important , ” he said .   
“
Well , it ’s important , obviously , thank you , but I do n’t want to dwell on that .   
If people make an issue out of it , I ’ll handle it .   
I knew what I was doing when I brought you on board .   
That ’s not what I want to talk to you about .
”
“ I stuck around , ” I said .   
“
To be something like a guardian for the students who were acting as witnesses , making sure they were n’t pressed too hard or made uncomfortable .   
I stopped when I realized being there was making some things harder , because they did n’t like being around me , or that it looked like I was trying to protect myself by inserting myself into things and influencing their testimony .
”
“
Yeah , ” Gilpatrick said .
“ I backed off , Jasper and Landon took my cues , I think .
”
“
That ’s good .
”
I thought that ’d be the time he followed the thread of the conversation and got around to saying what he needed to say .   
He did n’t .
There was a break in the convo .   
More cars were pulling into spaces along either side of the ‘ square’ of grass , sidewalk , and fountain in front of the community center .   
Some more parents .
“
Did they mention Fume Hood ?
” I asked .
“
Only that she was taken to the hospital and all signs were good when she left .   
Tempera was staying close to her .   
Something to do with paint ?
”
No news then .   
“ Tempera stopped the worst of the blood loss .   
She poured paint in the wound , shaped it , and solidified it .   
We might have lost Fume Hood in another way , though .   
We might not keep her as a hero after this .
”
“
Did she say that ?
”
“
There was a brief twilight between when the pain meds kicked in and when the meds knocked her out , ” I said .   
I moved my fingers , felt how unlike skin the backs of my hands felt , stiff with the stuff I had n’t managed to wash off .   
I ’d rushed , because I ’d wanted to get back to keeping an eye on the students from the patrol group .
“
Are you going to finish that thought ?
”
Gilpatrick asked , his voice soft .
I closed my eyes .   
“
Um .   
We chatted .   
She said she was staying with a family member already , so she ’d have someone to look after her if she needed it .
”
Thinking about family pulled my thoughts in a few different directions .   
I could have tried picking a safer one , but I was n’t sure I was that on the ball , being as tired and discouraged as I was .
I went on , “ Her brother cut ties with her when she went villain .   
She was living in that area where all the building foundations were screwed up because they were rushed , and everyone had to leave the homes they ’d just settled in , reached out to her brother , and she ’s been staying with him , reconnecting .   
It might give me some hope for her , having that positive influence , but she sounded pretty cynical about it all when we had the conversation right after meeting , before everything happened .
”
“
Cynicism is understandable , to a degree .   
That ’s where she ’s at .   
Where are you at , Victoria ?
”
“ Similar to Fume Hood , really .   
I was n’t evicted because of rushed apartment construction , but I ’ve been staying with my dad because it means we each pay half the rent , and I want to keep my options open with things being what they are .
”
“ I was n’t talking about living accommodations , ” Gilpatrick said .   
“
Your head , your heart .   
Are there any lingering effects from the emotion effect ?
”
“ For the last two years , ” I whispered .
“
Sorry ?   
I did n’t catch that , ” he said .
“ It ’s gone .   
It really sucked while it was in effect , but it ’s gone .   
Right now I ’m in that heavyhearted , almost - blameless - but - guilty ‘ morning after’ phase , where I ’m reflecting on everything I did when I was under the influence , ” I said .
“
I know that well enough .   
I ’ve been hit a few times by those , back when I was a squaddie and squad leader .   
And by you , once .
”
“
You asked me to , ” I pointed out , looking up at Gilpatrick , “ and this was a bad one .   
Snag ?   
I read about a thing online , keeping tabs on who was out there .   
I ’m pretty sure he ’s part of a new multitrigger cluster .   
It might have been amplified by the tinkering , if it was n’t , then something else was in play .   
That did n’t hit me like it was a minor or secondary power .
”
“
Sorry , ” he said .
He was n’t a bad guy .   
I wanted to be angry but I could n’t justify it .
“
I ’m sorry
it happened like this , ” he said .   
“
It was n’t supposed to be anything like this .   
I thought it ’d get a bit nasty with the civilian protesters but I did n’t think it ’d be anything like this .   
Not the capes , not the gunshot at the end .
” I had n’t either .
“
Jasper said you guessed why I sent those students with you .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
I climbed to my feet .
“
I ’m especially sorry for that , ” he said .   
“ If it was up to me , I would n’t have ever tested you like that .   
It was n’t wholly up to me .
”
“
Who ?
” I asked .
“ Everyone , ” he said .   
“ No - one .   
It ’s complicated .   
Wardens and the hero teams are being pressured to be mindful of who is out there , touching base , and they reached out to some of the other patrol groups with concerns .   
They wanted to coordinate , so teenagers would n’t be out interviewing or exposing themselves to anyone dangerous .   
School got to talking , and they got into CYA mode .
”
“
Cover your ass , ” I said .
“ They wanted to be able to say that they ’d made a reasonable effort to check that the parahumans the students were exposed to were reasonable and safe , in case anything happened down the line .   
I could have kept quiet about you , but … ”
He trailed off .
“
I would n’t have asked you to , ” I said .
“ …
I did n’t get the impression you wanted me to , either .   
You were n’t being secretive .   
I do n’t want to operate that way , either .
”
“
No .   
I would n’t want you to , ” I said .
“
You know I ca n’t keep you on the staff , ” he said .
I nodded .
There it was .
Fuck .
I had n’t been super attached to the job , but … fuck .
“ Using power on kids , the contention about possible conflict of interest , undue influence , danger .   
I think things will stay at that , I do n’t think it ’ll follow you .
” I nodded .
“
There ’s a dim chance of a student claiming emotional distress because of your aura and pursuing things in court , I ’ve already talked to one officer to get them on board and we ’ll get something in writing .   
I ’ll vouch for you and for the events as Jasper described them , one hundred percent , if you end up needing someone to stand for you .   
None of this was you .
”
“
Courts are a million years behind as it stands , and getting further behind every day we do n’t have an established system of government , ” I said .   
“
By the time things get that far it ’ll be forgotten .
”
“
That is a factor , ” Gilpatrick said .
I was n’t worried about that side of things .   
I was hurt , but I was n’t worried .
“
Do you need a hand getting things cleared out of the office ?
” he asked .
I shook my head .   
I did n’t want to think about that .
“
Can-
” I started .   
I cleared my throat .   
“
Can I get back to you on that ?   
I’ve-
I guess I ’ve got a family thing I should go to .
”
“ For sure , ” he said .   
“ Anytime outside of usual school or work hours .
”
I might have flinched in a way that he saw , hearing that .   
I knew why he ’d said it , but it still sucked to hear .
I started to walk away .
“ Victoria , ” he said .
“
Yeah ?
”
“
Any favor you need , reference letter , intel , if you need Jasper or some other trustworthy faces in uniform to lend a hand with something …
”
“
Thank you , ”
I said , my voice lighter and more cheerful than I felt .   
“ I ’ll be in touch .
”
I took off .
⊙ There was something very human about the desire to gather around a fire .   
Power rationing meant every household had only a certain amount , more if there were more people in the house .   
Conversely , there was a lot of cheap firewood .   
Streetlights flickered on , and many house lights went off .   
In back yards there were three other families on the city block that were gathering around fire pits .   
Two of the families were playing different kinds of music , but it was n’t too discordant .   
There were trees in each yard , front and back , and that helped to dampen the sound .
The entire street smelled like burning charcoal , and the light from the streetlights was just a little bit hazy with the ambient smoke .
It was a nice neighborhood , even if it had what I felt was the artificial quality .   
Houses with character , sufficiently different from one another in style and architecture , but still so new that they looked more like movie sets than lived - in places .   
Time and clutter would wear at those crisp edges .   
Paint and attention would turn fences of new wood with the occasional edge still frayed from the saw ’s touch into something more personal .
This was the flip side to the hostility and the street - wide gap between protester and community center .   
Boyfriend and girlfriend sat on an outdoor love seat together , arms around each other , bathed in fire ’s warmth .   
Friends sat and talked , beers in hand .   
Kids in another yard played with their dog .
With the path I ’d taken , I reached the backyard first .   
The driveway was wider than it was long , crushed gravel , with room for multiple vehicles , and a fence stretched from the house at one corner to the garage at the other .   
My mom had invited neighbors , so it was a thing , even if things had reached a more relaxed point .
My dad sat on one of the lawn chairs , fire pit in front of him with the fire having burned down to just glowing coals .   
The barbecue was to his right , lid open , tiny bits of meat clinging to the grill .
He was forty - two but looked younger .   
The fact that he was as fit as he was played into it- only the white in his beard stubble really gave it away .   
His hair , too , was short .   
He was the only one who had n’t put a sweatshirt or jacket on , owing to the proximity of the two heat sources- he was wearing a t - shirt that was form - fitting in a way that showed off his muscles .   
Pretty darn gross , given he was a dad ,    my dad , and he was supposed to dress his age .   
I would have insisted on clothes that hid any sign of muscle at all , really , had I been given a say .
He looked relaxed though .   
As relaxed as I ’d seen him in a while , really , and I ’d seen him passed out on the couch back at the apartment .
I was aware that my mom had seated herself so that two neighbors sat between her and my dad .   
Where my dad had dressed in a t - shirt and sports pants for the occasion , she had dressed up .   
Just a bit of lipstick , her hair short and styled , a ruffly sort of white blouse and pencil skirt .   
She ’d kicked off her shoes earlier in the evening , leaving them beneath her chair .
I was aware of the distinction in how they ’d dressed , too .   
In another time , before everything , there would have been more … connection , I supposed .   
Each influencing the other , until they matched more .
She was smiling .   
She folded one knee over the other , then a moment later was undoing the position , both feet on the porch again as she leaned forward , laughing at something someone had said .
I smiled .
The lights were on inside the house , too .   
The door was open , and people were scattered through the space between the stairs down to the porch , the back hallway , and the kitchen on the other side of the hallway .   
The room to the left of the hallway was dark .   
The neighbors kids , I presumed , teens to twenty - somethings .   
I saw a glimpse of Crystal stepping into the unlit room , tried to catch her eye with a raised hand as she looked toward the window , and failed .
I did get the attention of someone sitting next to my mom , though .   
She touched my mom
’s arm and pointed .
I remained where I was , arms folded on the top of the wooden - slat fence , chin on my hands , while my mom approached .
“ You ’re hurt , ” she said , touching my arm , where the road rash was .
“ Scuffed up .
”
“
Did you get the other guy ?
” she asked .   
She reached out and touched my hair , fixing it by moving strands to one side .
“
No , ” I said .   
“
But there were five of them .
”
“ Do you want to talk about it ?   
I ’m interested .
”
“
Not really , ” I said .   
“ Today-
”
My breath caught .
“ -Kind of not a good day
, ” I said .
I saw her expression change , even though the light source was behind her .
“
What ?
” I asked .   
“
Do n’t tell me you did n’t save me the dessert you promised .   
Looking forward to that is pretty much the only thing keeping me going right now .
”
She smiled , touching my cheek , before kissing me on the forehead .   
“
I saved you dessert with extras to take home , in case you want pie or pastries for breakfast tomorrow .
”
“ You ’ve done your duty then , ” I said , with mock seriousness .
“
It ’s been a long time since I ’ve failed a mission , ” she said , in the same tone .   
She put her hand on the side of my head .   
“
You missed Uncle Mike ,
I ’m afraid .
”
“
Oh shoot , ” I said .   
“
I barely remember him .   
How is he ?
”
“
He ’s Uncle Mike .   
He brought his wife and your cousins , and I have n’t child - proofed at all .   
It was … something , in the brief time he was here .   
A whirlwind of chaos and emotion , and then he was gone .
”
“
Ah , too bad , ” I said .
In the background , my dad was trying to get my attention .   
He ’d sat up , and did n’t look relaxed anymore .   
He offered me a small smile .   
I acknowledged him by lifting one hand up from where it sat on my elbow , in a mini - wave .
“
Thank you for coming , ”
my mom said .   
“ I know the family stuff is hard , after everything , but it means so much to me .   
To everyone .
”
“
I ’m here for the desserts , ” I said .   
I amended it to , “ … and a bit for family .
”
My mom lightly rapped me on the side of the head before stepping away .   
“
Come on in , then .   
Meet people , I ’ll get your pie .
” As she stepped over to the gate by the garage to unlock it , Crystal stepped out into the backyard , joined by a few others in our age group .   
She glanced in my direction , saw me , and froze like a deer in the headlights .
Her arms folded , defensive , like something was wrong .
She mouthed words at me , and I could n’t see her face well enough at a distance to know what the words were , but I could draw conclusions from context .
My dad ’s posture , still sitting upright now , both feet planted on the ground .
My mom ’s earlier change in expression .   
Even the wording- I backed away from the fence a few steps .   
My mom froze , the gate only slightly open .
“
You invited her , ” I said .   
I was n’t talking about Crystal .
In reaction to that , my mother did n’t look confused , she did n’t negate .   
She looked toward the house , to see what I ’d seen that had clued me in .
Whirlwind of fucking chaos and emotion indeed .
“
You invited her , ” I said , again .   
More emotional this time .   
“
She ’s in the house ?
”
My mother rallied , composing herself .   
Now she looked confused .   
“
I told you I invited everyone .
”
“
She ’s actually in the house , ” I said .
I backed away again , and my mother threw the gate open , taking several steps on the driveway , stepping on crushed gravel with bare feet .
I raised my hand , indicating for her to stop .   
She continued forward .
I threw my aura out , one push .
My mother stopped .   
Crystal stopped in her tracks , already at the fence .   
People rose from their seats .
“ I thought you knew , ” she said .   
“
I very clearly said everyone .   
It was supposed to be a family reunion with everyone getting together again for the first time in … in a really long time .
”
“
You ’re a lawyer , ” I said .   
“
You ’re too clever with wording to be that fucking stupid .
”
“
Please , ” she said , with a tone like she was the one who needed to exercise patience and restraint here .   
“
Let ’s keep things civil .
”
I could n’t even look at her .   
I trembled as my eyes dropped to the ground .
“ I ’ve made mistakes , as your sister has , ” my mother said .   
“
She ’s been doing so well .   
I want to make up for past wrongs and be a mother to both of you , like I should have been from the beginning .
”
I looked up , staring at her .
The lipstick , the composed outfit , the words , the everything about this all seemed so false now , so forced .   
I did n’t even recognize her .
“
You ’re kind of fucking it up , ” I said , in the kind of whisper that was the only tone I could manage that
was n’t outright screaming at her .   
My hands were clenched at their sides .
“
That ’s not fair .
”
“
You ’re kind of really fucking it up
, ” I said , in the same strangled whisper .
“
Victoria-
”
“
You ’re fucking it up , mother , ” I said .   
“
You ’re fucking-
you ’re fucking-
did dad play along with this ?
”
“
I told him everyone was coming .   
You , your sister , Crystal , Uncle Mike .   
He was surprised , but … pleasantly surprised .
”
Dad too , then .   
There was that heart - wrenched - out feeling again .   
I screwed my eyes shut , inadvertently squeezing out tears .   
I was aware her neighbors were seeing .
“
Don’t- do n’t get emotional , Victoria , ” my mom said .   
“
Please , I did n’t do this to hurt you .   
The furthest thing from it .
”
“ You fucked that up too ,
” I whispered .
“
Stop saying that .   
Please , ” my mother said .   
“
It ’s the age of second chances , she ’s worked very hard to get to this point .   
I ’ve talked to people who worked with her
and she ’s getting back into her routine in a good way .   
I want all of us to have a second shot at this , and do it right this time .
”
I shook my head .
“
Leaving things as unresolved as they are is doing more harm than good .   
To both you and to her .
”
“
So you thought you ’d invite me to dinner and surprise me with her , and you thought there was nothing I could say or do because people are here ?
”
“
You ’re putting thoughts and conspiracy in my head , ” she said .   
“ I want you to be sisters again .   
I want us to be a family again .
”
“
That ’s not for you to decide , ” I said .   
“ Holy shit .   
Holy shit .   
Holy shit .
”
“ Please , do n’t wind yourself up .   
You ’re getting out of breath .   
Let ’s communicate .   
Please .
” I was getting out of breath .   
I gulped in a breath of air .   
“
You ’re aware I ca n’t set foot in that house again , right ?   
I ’ll see her looming in the shadows , potentially another surprise invite .
”
“ I want you to find reconciliation , so you would n’t feel upset even if she did appear by surprise .
”
“ I ca n’t accept any invites from you , ” I said .   
My face started to contort , and I forced it back into something more normal before I lost the ability to see my mother or focus on her altogether .   
“
I ca n’t grab dessert from you or do anything with you again because she might be there , surprise .   
I ca n’t trust you .   
How can I trust you again ?
”
“
I ’m
sorry
you feel that way .   
I did not realize that was where things stood .   
You ’ve been doing so well , and she ’s been doing well .
”
“
How- ” I started .   
I gulped in another breath of air .   
My voice was a whisper again when I managed to speak again .   
“
How do you not realize when you saw me at the hospital ?   
How do you even think rec-
how do you think this is ever possible ?   
How does-
”
I closed my eyes .   
More tears .
“ How does Dad ?   
How could you see me then , how could you- how- how- ” My chest hurt .
“
Crystal-
”
I said , I looked toward the house .
Crystal was still on the porch .   
Standing guard by the back door , red shield up .   
She watched me talking with my mom over one shoulder .
“
I told Crystal the same thing I told your father .   
She was skeptical but she agreed it was for the best .
”
I did n’t trust my mom
’s version of events on that .   
Crystal at least had my back in this moment .
I tried to find words , and I did n’t have the oxygen .
“ Catch your breath .   
We can talk this out .
”
I worked at it , swallowing air .
“
I ’ll wait , ” she said .
The sound of her voice made it harder , not easier .
When I spoke , my voice was very small .   
It gained more strength as I went .
“
How can you have not been there , missed visits , or come to the visit and spend more time talking to doctors than to me because it was hard to be around me ?   
How can you have come to see me then , and have had to avert your eyes mid - conversation with me , and found that hard , and not realize that I had to live it for two years , and had that be a million times harder for me ?
”
“ I know it was hard , honey .   
I get it , I really do .   
But you ca n’t dwell in the past .   
It ’s not good for you .   
You ca n’t carry that .
”
“
You say that , when you still sleep with the lights on , ” I said .
It was her turn to not have words .
“
That ’s different ,
” she said , finally .   
She did n’t say how it was different .
I stared at her .
“
I want all of us to conquer our demons , ” she said .   
“
I think you want that too .
”
I continued to stare .
Finally , I said , “ I want that too .
”
“
We can talk this out .   
We can find things we all want , ” she said .   
“
We can make inroads on this .
”
She looked nearly as upset as I felt , even as composed as she was .
But in the end , and I ’d known this from very early on , seeing her with- with her , she was n’t a whole and complete person .   
She tried , she put on a good face , but my mother had been broken long , long ago , and with the way she ’d put herself together , she retained only sufficient compassion , understanding , and empathy for a very small number of people .   
For one daughter , at most .
Second chances .   
Second go - around , and
I was n’t that daughter , this time .
“
In the interest of putting my demons to rest , ” I said .   
“
I ’m going to keep my distance .   
Do n’t call , because I ca n’t trust a thing you say .   
I ’ll figure out what I ’ll do about Dad later .
”
“ Do n’t , ” she said .   
“
Nothing gets better if you close off communication .
”
There were things I wanted to say to that .
It was n’t worth it .
I turned to go .
I heard the gravel under her feet as she gave chase , and I pushed out with my aura , hard .
“
Do not use your power on me , Victoria Dallon .   
That has never been okay , and it does n’t work anyway .
”
I drew in a deep breath .   
There were things I wanted to say to that , too .
I settled for , “
Let me go .   
If you follow me , I ’m liable to hit you with something harder than my aura .   
I ’m pretty sure that would work .
”
It might have been a good line , if I had n’t been choking back emotion as I said it .
I walked away .   
I did n’t trust myself to fly when I could n’t see straight .   
Having a panic attack in the air made for an embarrassing moment .
People stood in rows at the fences that bounded their yards , staring and watching .   
I wiped away my tears once , then resolved not to shed more , not where people could see .   
I set my jaw .
In the background , I could hear my father ’s raised voice .
Breathe .   
Center yourself .   
Move forward .   
Plan .
I thought about what I ’d need to do next .   
I could n’t go back to the apartment I shared with my dad .
For the time being , I only walked , out in the general direction of the water .   
Streetlights lit up in advance of imminent cars and as I stepped onto the streets , turning off otherwise .   
Here and there they would turn on for wildlife , illuminating a lost deer or raccoon mid - scurry down the road .   
We ’d set ourselves up so abruptly that the animals were still confused .
It was getting cooler .   
I wore my skirt , my clothes from earlier .   
My forcefield shielded against the wind , which kept it from lowering the temperature even further , but it did n’t do a lot to shield me from the ambient heat or lack thereof .
I tensed as I heard running footsteps behind me .   
I stopped in my tracks .
Not Crystal .   
She would have flown , and she would have set down well in front of me .   
She would n’t have chased , maybe .
Her , then .
I did n’t want to look .   
I did n’t want to speak to her .
I pushed out with my aura , instead .
Another footstep , closer .
Our mother ’s daughter .
I threw my arm back and to the side , a backhand swipe .   
I tore through lawn , through slabs of sidewalk , and the edge of the road .   
Dirt flew across the street alongside clumps of grass and chunks of sidewalk .
A long pause , and then I heard the footsteps again , running .   
This time the other way .
⊙ Gilpatrick jumped as I appeared in the doorway of his office , nearly knocking over a paper container of noodles in red sauce that rested on a stack of paper .   
Paperwork
I would have been helping him with , had the day gone differently .
“ Victoria ?   
What ’s wrong ?
” he asked .
So it was that obvious something was wrong .
“ I need to call in a favor , ” I said .
Okay , hearing my voice , I could get why he ’d known .   
I sounded like another person entirely .
“ If it ’s okay , ” I said .
“
Of course it ’s
okay , ” he said .   
“
What ’s wrong ?   
Are you cold ?   
The temperature dropped steeply tonight .   
What can I get you ?   
Sit .
”
He stood , circling around his desk .   
I backed away a little as he did , which was his cue to stop .
I was n’t sure how to respond , how to ask .
“ By the way , ” he said .   
“
As far as I ’m concerned , there ’s no need to count .   
I consider you a friend , and I feel like a piece of shit for setting you up to fail like that .
”
“
It ’s not that , ” I said .   
“
I just need a place to stay tonight .   
While I figure some things out .   
I ’ll be gone before the students arrive first thing .
”
I noted the hesitation before he responded .
“
Sure , ” he said .
“ You paused .
”
“ Only because it ’s not really a great place for staying overnight .   
You could come to my apartment , but that’s- ” “
I kind of want space to think , ” I said .   
“ Offer
’s appreciated .
”
“
There ’s an issue with power rations and temperature is supposed to drop a few more degrees , and this place is n’t insulated well .   
It was a bitch last winter .
”
“ I remember , ” I said .
“
Of course , ” Gilpatrick said .
He kept giving me very deeply concerned looks .   
Almost pity .
I really hated those .   
I ’d had a lifetime ’s fill and then some .
“
Okay , ” he said .   
“
I ’ve got a space heater right by my desk here .   
You ’ll want to be careful if you ’re leaving it running for a while , fire hazard .
”
“ I ’ll be careful , ” I said .
“
There are blankets we stowed in the locker rooms that you can use if you want to sleep .   
You could get something serviceable if you gather a bunch .   
I laundered them not too long ago , too .
”
“ I know where to find them .
”
“
There are candles too , in case the power runs out .   
But again , fire hazard .
”
“
It ’s okay , ” I said .   
“ I ’ll be careful .
”
“ Okay , ” he said .   
“
You sure you do n’t want company ?   
We can talk it out , if you have n’t eaten I can go grab something , or … ” I was already shaking my head .
“
Sure , ” he said .   
“
I was needing an excuse to go home , this will do .   
Unless maybe I should stay around ?   
You could settle in upstairs , and I ’ll be all the way down here , you can have your space to think and you can still have me to talk to in case
you decide you need it .
”
“
No , ” I said .   
“
Do n’t let me keep you .   
Go home .   
You ’ll have angry parents to talk to first thing tomorrow , once they ’ve figured out what happened and had time to get angry .
”
He frowned .   
“
Yeah .
”
“ Please , ” I said .   
“
I know where everything is .
”
“
Yeah , ” he said .   
“
You sure you ’re okay ?   
You ’re not going to … ”
He trailed off .
“ If I was going to do anything , I ’d take someone out with me .
”
He scrutinized me .
“
I ’m worried here , for the record , ” he said .
“
I ’ll manage , ” I said .   
“ I ’ve managed this far .
”
“
You have my number , ” he said .
“
Yeah .
”
“
You call if you need anything .
”
“
Yeah .
”
“
And you … be here in the morning when I show up .   
Which will be well before the kids do .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“
Okay , ” he said .
He gathered up his paper container , a stack of his papers .   
He was trying to pick up the remainder when I approached , picking it up myself .
Silent , I walked him to his car , handing over the papers when it was time .   
I walked inside and locked the door behind me .   
The place was big and it was dark , with the open gymnasium space unlit .
I carted the space heater upstairs , and then I got the blankets .   
I got the candles and the matches , and then I found the file boxes , collapsed and gathered in piles .
I situated myself in my office , which was n’t technically my office anymore , and I set to making the boxes , pulling my things off the shelves , and getting them stowed away .
The space heater hummed and the computer monitor clicked , as I periodically checked something or followed up on something I ’d seen on a file .
I made a stack of the things I wanted to read , the files that intrigued or that I ’d forgotten about , the magazines I liked .   
I was a third of the way through my shelves , twelve boxes filled , when I finally settled down in my chair , pulling blankets over me , and started to read .
I got about two pages read before deciding I did n’t have it in me to read more .
I did n’t have it in me to sit still , when my anxieties were churning .
I stood , dropping blankets on the floor , and walked over to the window .   
With the cold , the space heater , and the imperfect seal , moisture and fog had collected on it .
I reached out toward the window , a foot away from touching it .   
I turned on my forcefield .
A pause .
Then a handprint on the window , in the condensation .   
Then another .
A circular smudge that streaked , a naked breast pressed against the glass , moving .
Then the mark that could n’t be anything but one half of a face , beneath the circular smudge .
They moved , and I was n’t asking them to move .   
The window rattled a bit as it was pushed against .
The prints smudged .
A fingernail dragged against the glass , and produced a high pitched squeal , almost ear - splitting .
I dropped the forcefield .   
I sank back into my seat , and it protested the landing .
Not a second trigger .   
I was well aware of that .   
When I ’d first had my forcefield , it had n’t protected my costume .   
I had two theories as to why .
The first theory was that I ’d grown , and the boundaries that the forcefield used to define ‘ me’ had changed .   
I ’d breathe out , breathe in , gain a pound here , lose a pound there , and it would adjust for the maximum bounds .   
It did n’t explain how my skirt was often protected , but I ’d mused on that too , that my legs moved , my hair had been long at one point
, I ’d been shorter …
I ’d been that , the forcefield had adjusted , and that was the new upper bound of what I was , forever with me .
It felt thin , as theories went .
The second theory was that it was the Manton effect , that broad - as - bells term for the built in protections and limitations of the power .   
The theory was that the built - in protections of the power only protected what I saw as a part of me , and it had taken some time before the costume was that much a part of my identity .
That that was me , now , as much as the costume I wore .
I could n’t be that .   
I could n’t sit still and be crushed under the weight of that thing .
I needed to do something , and taking books off the shelves felt like it was moving backward , not forward .
I spun around in my seat , and I loaded up the webpage .   
Something to do .   
Methodically filling out details on the group I ’d seen , researching , filling myself in , and letting others know what they were up against .









 Daylight streamed in at a low angle as I stepped back into my office .   
The light was blurred as it came through the condensation on the window , spotted with dots of darkness due to the melted frost that still clung to the window
’s surface in lines and constellations of droplets .   
Ninety percent of my books were packed up , the boxes that were still here were stacked near the door and the bookshelf , labeled in thick marker , with shorthand notes on the most interesting and essential files within written on the boxes in pen .   
I ’d left a few of the more interesting files available .   
I ’d put them in a box on their own , in case I needed something to read . 

My phone was plugged into the computer .   
I checked it , and made a small and sleepy pump of my fist as it lit up .   
Then I saw the red number on the digital - display dial , and let my hand drop .   
Missed messages : too many . 

It was n’t that I cared that much about the phone .   
It was that the phone being on meant there was power again .   
That the power was on again meant I could turn the space heater on .   
I flicked the switch , turned on my computer , then lit the candles for what little good heat they offered and wrapped a blanket around me before settling in my computer chair . 

I was freshly showered , towel around my hair , and I ’d gotten dressed in a slightly musty spare change of clothes .   
I had a blanket , candles , and a computer booting up .   
I watched as it started the struggle of fighting every other computer out there that was wanting a piece of the web . 

There were worse ways to take things easy on myself . 

I slid my to - do list across the desk until it was beside my keyboard .   
I ’d need a car .   
Plenty of people were willing to offer the use of theirs in order to pay for fuel .   
Food , a place to stay . 

Living accommodations might be tricky .   
Demand was high , and it was a pretty steep drop in quality from the central areas and the fringes .   
Many companies were putting up five or more houses a day or an apartment complex over the course of a week , slapping them together like there was a gun to their heads .   
When it came time to find renters , they were more interested in filling the spaces fast .   
They had no reason to answer questions or have a potential buyer investigating the nooks and crannies or checking the plumbing if they could turn that person away and have someone else on their doorstep within minutes . 

It was a minefield .   
Word of mouth , cash , contacts , or luck were required to get a proper house that would n’t start falling apart after the fact .   
Fume Hood was one of the ones who ’d been unlucky . 

In more than one way . 

My homepage was parahumans online , though .   
On top of the missed calls and messages on my phone , I had a slew on the site .

I had no part in this .
I should have been smarter .
I did not know really truly 

I marked it as unread and minimized it .   
I did n’t want to think about it for the moment . 

News .   
Inquiry into the circumstances of Lachlan Hund .   
Not a trial , but an inquiry , some questions by people with more official standing .   
He ’d fallen in with some sketchy people , and there were thoughts about there being powers involved . 

The inquiry was the story of the hour , it seemed .   
Heroes stood by to step in and take him away to get help if officials were suspicious he ’d been manipulated , but it was sounding like he would go home with his new family .   
That sucked . 

Other articles , further down the pages .   
Fume Hood was alive , and she was a contentious topic .   
The actions on the part of the shooter seemed to have split people into two factions , with the ones supporting Fume Hood slightly edging out the ones who condemned her .   
Strange to see . 

I wanted more info on her situation , and unfortunately , that was all I got . 

I added another note to my to - do list .   
I ’d reach out to Fume Hood , check in .   
I ’d satisfy my curiosity and nag her about the name choice , which I ’d been meaning to do but had n’t had the chance to . 

My eye traveled up to the unread messages .   
Crystal ’s responses . 

It all felt like I was taking a massive backward step .   
Like I was back in the immediate aftermath of Gold Morning .   
Two legs , two arms , bewildered , emotional .   
I was bothered , upset .   
I did n’t know what to do with myself . 

I ’d been angry at my parents then too .   
For various reasons .   
Angry at a lot of people and things . 

I had n’t and did n’t want that to define me . 

I clicked on Crystal ’s account name again .

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : S’okay . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : I know how these things go . 

Point_Me_@_The_Sky : I saw this sort of thing play out when it was n’t aimed at me .   
I can read between the lines and speak Carol - ese
and I picked up on what she was saying about you being skeptical about the situation 
 Point_Me_@_The_Sky :
I absolve you on the condition of one get together where we have some good eating , your treat , and you need to let me know if you hear of any good apartments or things because I am not good going back to my dads 

I drummed my fingers on my desk , mused that my motivations might have to do with my being hungry . 

More news articles .   
Some capes were taking on roles as icons and iconoclasts for the various movements in the civilian sectors .   
Four hero teams led the ‘ icon’ groups .   
Advance Guard , Foresight , the Shepherds and the Attendant . 

The first two were aimed at pushing forward .   
New approaches , doing things right this time .   
The opinions on what that way forward looked like it differed , feeding into the division between the two groups . 

Things were changing .   
The Shepherds and Attendant had been groups divided along similar lines , but the Shepherds were self - combusting , and the remaining members were folding into the Attendant .   
There was some debate over what the name of the resulting team would be . 

And then there were three , I thought . 

I idly browsed , caught between liking the Shepherd ’s aesthetic and icons better while liking the Attendant ’s mindset of moving slowly , with caution .   
I was suspicious
it might end up being the opposite .   
As it was , the Attendant ’s approach tacked on a bit too much ‘ remember what we lost’ for my liking , clinging to the past , being defined by it , but- 

There was a knock on the door . 

“
Come in , ” I said . 

Gil opened the door .   
He had two coffees in a tray in one hand and a bag in the other , and he had to juggle them both as he opened the door . 

I rose to my feet . 

“
Sit , ” he said .   
He nearly dropped his drink as he saw the boxes .   
“ Shit on me , you ’re packed .
” 

“ I ’ll be done in time to be gone before the students turn up , ” I said , sitting . 

“
I ’m not so concerned about that right now , ” he said .   
He put the bag and coffees on the desk .   
“
How are you ?
” 

I shrugged . 

“
You look better .
” 

I had a headache from not sleeping and not eating , and from the post - stress hangover , but I also felt lighter than air in a euphoric , fragile way .   
It was as if I ’d just gotten over a bad round of the flu , and I was at the point where I was getting over the worst of it , but if I did the wrong thing or tested my body in the wrong way I ’d be sick and hurting again . 

Better . 

I shrugged again .   
“
Yeah .   
That word could apply .
” 

“
Did you sleep at all ?
” 

I snorted air out of my nose .   
“
I ’ll sleep when I ’m so tired
I have no other choice .
” 

“
But you ’re feeling better than you were ?
” 

“
Yeah .   
Better than I was .   
Thanks for letting me stay over , ” I said . 

He pulled a breakfast burger out of the paper bag , and my eyes must have lit up , because he smiled , passing it to me . 

A double - decker English muffin , with bacon , two eggs , lettuce , tomato and very sharp mustard . 

I was n’t normally one to eat egg , but I did n’t let that stop me . 

I ’d taken too big of a bite .   
I swallowed hard . 

It was good .   
Visceral .   
Like Snag ’s power , the hit of emotion as I enjoyed it was like a bit of metal , closing an electrical connection .   
Rounding off a thought I had n’t wanted to make . 

Feeding tubes .   
The insertions , the removals .   
The tube being there , one eye watching the beige fluid moving through steadily .   
Really wanting something good .   
Going almost four months without , because they were n’t sure I could .   
Then having it be a chore .   
It had been better than the alternative , but a chore , to force myself to eat it right , to chew it thoroughly enough . 

I swallowed hard again , not because I had another bite to swallow . 

Gilpatrick was looking at my files and notes , his back to me , my English muffin sandwich in my hands . 

He glanced at me , saw the blinking , and looked away .   
“
If you want to talk , I ’m all ears .
” 

“ I do n’t , thank you , ” I said .   
“
I had a bad day , the part you knew about , then it got worse .   
Now I ’m trying to get centered .
” 

He nodded . 

“
This is really good , ” I said . 

“
They are , I took a bite of mine in the car and then ate it before I got here , ” he said .   
He bent over a box , looking at the notes .   
“ Man , I wish I still had access to these files and books .   
I ’d try bribing you if I could do it in good conscience .
” 

I swallowed again .   
“
They ’re mine
and I ’m too straightlaced to be bribed .   
You can call me if you want to ask about any of it .
” 

“
Then I owe you more favors , am I right ?
” 

“ I thought we were n’t counting anymore , ” I said . 

He did n’t respond to that .   
He picked up a file , paging through it . 

“
Which one is that ?
” 

“ Ossuary .   
Why leave it out ?
” 

“
They ’re back , or they will be soon , ”
I said .   
“ Activist villains with a heavy focus on environment .   
They would n’t call themselves villains , I do n’t think .   
Long list of really messy executions , longer list of leaders with very short tenures , who try to pull a very disparate group together , fail , and abdicate .
” 

“ Were they the ones who used to call themselves Elephant Graveyard ?
” 

“
That ’s the one .   
One of the early leaders pushed the name change along with a shift away from focusing on animals and animal welfare , ” I said .   
“
I liked Elephant Graveyard more , I think .   
Clunky , but clunky in a way that stands out , and it made for really good imagery , when they left a spray painted calling card .
” 

“ I do n’t want to pry , ” Gilpatrick said . 

“
About Ossuary ?
” 

“
About you .   
I spent a while thinking about what to do .   
I ’ve had some good bosses and bad bosses over the years .   
When you throw yourself into the fray like you do when you ’re a PRT squaddie , you really need to know that the people above you are looking out for you .   
That your back is covered .
” 

“
Yeah , ” I said .   
Same applied to family , to parents . 

“ I do n’t want to push boundaries or cross any lines , and I do n’t want to ask the wrong thing .   
When you say you do n’t want to talk , can I ask why ?   
Any answer you gave could help me make sure
I ’m
covering your back as you move on to better things .
” 

“
Because I ’d have to fill you in on years of background and that ’s not stuff
I want to relive ,
” I said . 

“
Ah .
” 

“
Because it ’s confidential , because it ’s messy , because … as cool as a guy as you can be , you ca n’t make it better .   
You ca n’t give me the answers or guidance I need because there ’s a whole ream of things that ’s separate and aside from the years of my background that you ’d need to get into or know
and … I ’m going overboard with this .
” 

“ I do want to hear , ” he said .   
“
Anything else ?
” 

“
That ’s mostly it , ” I said . 

He nodded .   
He rubbed his head for a second , thinking .   
“
You want company ?
” 

“
Nah , ”
I said .   
“
I ’d just be packing the last few boxes .   
I would n’t mind a hand getting them out to the car , just to speed things up when the time comes .
” 

“ You have a car ?
” 

“ I ’ll get someone off of a listing or something .   
I ’ve got to figure out what I ’m doing ,
so there ’s that too .   
I would n’t be good company , while I ’m working through all of that .
” 

“ You do n’t have to be packed up and gone today , ” he said . 

“
I kind of need to , ” I said . 

He nodded , rubbing his head again .   
“ I ’ll cover the car .   
I ’ll pay the driver .
” 

“
Thank you , ” I said . 

“ You know where to find me .   
Place is empty , so you can shout from the stairs
and I ’ll hear you .
” 

“
Right , ” I said . 

“
I ’m going to head to my office .   
I ’ve got something to do .
” 

I gave him a little salute . 

Energized by food and coffee , still feeling lightweight , I worked on getting my boxes packed up .   
Along the way , I slotted my files and folders into the box I ’d reserved for the most pertinent factors .   
The villains of the area , the heroes , and the villains turned hero .   
The hoods . 

The day was warming up .   
The light from the sun was warm enough to counteract the lower temperature .   
By midday , if yesterday was any indication , it would be short - sleeves and shorts weather again . 

A message popped up on my screen .

Private Messages from Glitzglam : 

Glitzglam : game plan .
u situate yourself at my place until you have apartment ur happy with .   
u & I raid ur dads place while he at work , get ur stuff .   
standard attack formation , I play defense , make sure coast is clear , I support you , u take point and do what u need 
 I fired off my response .   
That worked .   
I had a couch to sleep on . 

One thing off of my to - do list .   
I liked the progress .   
Progress was good .   
So long as I moved forward , I could stay aloft . 

I cleared off the remainder of the bookshelves , stacking the boxes .   
I scribbled out my notes on the lid , checking the contents . 

There was a knock at the door . 

“
Come in , ” I said . 

Gilpatrick . 

“ Time for me to go ?
” I asked . 

“
Nah , ” he said .   
“
There ’s a bit .   
I do n’t want to force you out the door like that .
” 

“
Okay , ” I said .   
I raised an eyebrow . 

“ I was thinking , over the past twelve hours , if you were my student , I would n’t want to let you go with things like this .   
Normally I ’d contact a guardian .
” 

My heart skipped a beat at that .   
No . 

“
But you said last night you had a family thing to do .   
I can connect dots .
” 

I nodded . 

“
I made some phone calls , ” he said . 

He stepped out of the doorway . 

Mrs. Yamada .   
Shorter than me , hair tied back in a simple ponytail , wearing a skirt , white top , and jacket , with a simple , short string of pearls at her collarbone . 

“
Oh wow , ” she said .   
“ Look at you .
” 

I did n’t have words , so I just lifted my arms to either side and let them fall . 

“
Is this okay ?
” Gilpatrick asked . 

“
Yeah , ” I said .   
I swallowed .   
“
Yeah .   
Just about perfect .
” 

“
I ’ll leave you to it , ” he said . 

Jessica blinked a few times , before fanning herself .   
“
I ’m a little misty eyed .   
Sorry .
” 

I was a little misty eyed myself . 

“
Can I give you a hug ?
” she asked .   
When I nodded , she did so .   
I hugged her back . 

“
You put me down as your emergency contact ?
” she asked . 

“
Sorry , ” I said .   
“ I-
I honestly forgot
I did that .   
It was more than a year ago .
” 

I ’d had to name someone , and I had n’t named my parents because- 

Because . 

“
It ’s more than alright , ” she said .   
“
Your boss said he was worried about you .
” 

I opened my mouth to reply , and then the waterworks started instead . 

⊙ 

Jessica slammed the back hatch of her car , most of the boxes settled inside . 

“
Do you want to walk ?
” she asked .   
“ Around the block , maybe ?   
Or we could step back inside .
” 

If I was going to start crying again . 

Students were just now starting to appear , and I did n’t want to sit still . 

“ We can walk , ” I said . 

“
It ’s been amazing to hear your voice , ” she said .   
“ I know you were often frustrated , trying to communicate with the means you had available .   
I was frustrated too , but I was n’t allowed to say that .
” 

“
I could tell , ” I said . 

“
You were a challenging patient , those first few months- ” 

I snorted . 

“
-but much like many teachers say they grow to care most about the class clowns and problem students , I came to hold you close to my heart .   
I wanted so badly to give you answers and to hear you out without having to rely on text to speech and letters you wrote between appointments .   
I wanted to dialogue , and it was so very hard to do that .
” 

“
It was , ” I said . 

Why was it so much easier to talk about the things that I could n’t normally even think about , like this ? 

“
How did you find your way back from that ?
” 

How did I become Victoria again , instead of the wretched thing in the hospital room , or in the home for invalids ? 

“
My sister , ” I said , my voice soft . 

“
Oh .   
That ’s not an easy thing , ” she said . 

“
No , ” I said , my voice even softer . 

I ’d already filled her in on the details of yesterday and the past few months .   
She ’d offered a listening ear .   
I ’d spent all night working out my next few steps , I knew what the situation was , I did n’t really need more angles to view it from . 

This , though … if I was going to make the most of the time I had with her here , then I wanted to at least get a handle on this . 

“ We were all brought to the battlefield during Gold Morning .   
There ’s …
that ’s a hard topic to field .
” 

“
There ’s an unspoken agreement that the civilians do n’t get to know , ” she said . 

“
But you ’re not really a civilian , ” I said . 

“
No , ” she said .   
“
I ’ve heard reports .   
Some from very close to the center of the action .   
I know what happened .
” 

“
Body , mind , and heart , you know how that ’s a thing ?
” I asked . 

“
Yes .
” 

“
I lost my body , two years before Gold Morning .   
My heart was … twisted into something unrecognizable .
” 

“
Yes .
” 

“
And … Gold Morning hit .   
And the-
” I paused .   
There were people on the street , walking toward the school gate and the various block buildings as we walked away from it all .   
A tide we walked against .   
I had to shut up until people were mostly out of earshot .   
“
And I was controlled in mind .   
I did n’t have much , but I could make my decisions .   
I could decide to use my power or not .   
She took that away from me , for a brief time .
” 

“
I ’ve talked to a number of people who had a very hard time with that .
” 

“ You know who she was ?
” 

“ I do .
” 

I nodded to myself . 

“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
My sister told me .
” 

Even if I was free to talk , the words still carried their ugly weight .   
The words and associated mental pictures still dragged my mood down . 

“
She knew me or knew of me , or she knew my sister .   
She decided in the end that she ’d put my sister right next to me .   
She did n’t do that for many people at all , as far as I can tell .
” 

“
And your sister healed you ?
” 

“ Gave me a body again .   
Um .   
She made me seventeen again .   
Walked back the clock , as if it …
I do n’t know .   
So she did n’t take two years of my life from me in body , like she did in everything else .   
I ’m
physically nineteen now , apparently .
” 

“
You said body , mind and spirit .   
She fixed one of the three .   
Did she undo the effect on your emotions ?
” 

I drew in a breath , sighed heavily .   
I nodded .   
“
She actually- she turned off my emotions .   
Suppressed them .   
Then she asked me what I wanted .
” 

“
What did you want ?
” 

“ I remember thinking , you know , it was really possible
she wanted me to say that I wanted to go back to liking her .   
And if she did think that , then it was unconscionable .   
Divorced from all emotion , I thought it was unconscionable .
” 

“
Okay .
” 

“ And
divorced from all emotion , I thought I ’d be fair .   
That I ’d give her the benefit of a doubt .   
That I ’d assume that was n’t what she meant or wanted .   
I told her I wanted to remember .
” 

“
To remember ?
” 

“
Those two years , ” I said , my voice hollow .   
I drew in another deep breath . 

Further down the street , a nine or ten year old boy with straight black hair and brown skin looked at Jessica , his eyes widening , then he looked at me .   
He raised his hand , extending it toward Jessica as they passed one another . 

She gave him a high five , then pushed his head , sending him on his way , toward the school . 

“
They were n’t good years .
” 

“ Rationally ?   
Divorced from emotion ?   
I knew .   
I ca n’t forgive her .   
Ever .   
I ca n’t forget what she did , or she might do it again .   
To someone else .   
To me .   
I told her to fix my feelings and leave my brain alone otherwise .
” 

“
It ’s a heavy weight to carry , ” she said . 

“
Those two years are really damn heavy , ” I said .   
“ Everything else is .   
But I ’ve been holding on to that moment .   
I hate that I hold onto it , because she did it , but everything is tainted by her , so what can I do ?
” 

“
You hold onto it ?   
How ?
” 
 “
Being emotionless , putting those feelings away .   
My feelings and impulses got me into that whole mess in the first place .   
I hurt an awful lot of awful people , you know .
” 

“ We ’ve talked about that .   
You wrote letters outlining your thoughts and how you wanted to apologize to some of those affected .
” 

“
My entire life leading up to that basketball game , I wanted so horribly badly to be a hero , you know ?   
It felt like I thought about it every ten minutes .   
My parents were heroes , my cousin was , my aunt and uncle were , and everything revolved around it .   
I wanted it all so badly it hurt , and I did n’t have it for years .   
Then that basketball game , and I wanted to have something where I was the hero , where I got to stand out .   
Because sometimes it felt like my parents did n’t see me .
” 

“ That ’s been a recurring idea .   
You talked about their missed visits .
” 

“
They came a lot , ” I said .   
“
I know that .   
My dad more than my mom .   
But every missed visit was a horrible thing , and the little things mattered so much when I had nothing else .   
Um .   
And this basketball game , I know I ’ve talked about this before .   
But this one girl kicked my freaking ass .   
In my face , knocking me over , intercepting every pass , blocking every shot .   
She did n’t have any powers or anything , she was just … good .   
Better .
” 

“
A lot of things came into focus in that moment .
” 

“ Every time she or one of her teammates beat me , I could see the look of disappointment on my parent ’s faces .   
In the other moments , they looked so bored .   
And it was boring , you know .   
No parent wants to go sit through amateurs doing badly at a high school sport .
” 

“ Some do .
” 

“
Anyway , she hit me hard , she said something about me being overrated , and it was the last straw .   
Realizing I stood so far from family , that I did n’t want to be there , but I had no other choice , my sternum was hurting where she ’d driven her elbow into me .   
I got my powers .
” 

“
Years of wanting , leading up to that .
” 

She ’d caught the thread I ’d wanted to lay out .   
It helped .   
“
And then just under three years as Victoria - slash - Glory - Girl .   
And then … hospital .
” 

“
Which was undeniably horrible .
” 

“
It felt like my life had ended .   
No hope or help .   
All I had to cling to were those memories of the three years I was Glory Girl .   
I could look back , think about every fight , every encounter .   
The ones I was proud of .   
The ones I was n’t .   
I had so much regret , replaying events out in my head .   
It started with me thinking about- that moment when it all went so wrong .   
When she messed with my emotions , then going backward .
” 

Emotions caught me .   
I made my expression a scowl , because I was worried what my face might do otherwise . 

“
I was such a stupid fucking kid , ” I said . 

“
That ’s allowed , ” she said . 

I shook my head .   
“
Not when you ’re as strong as I am .
” 

“
And you want to be emotionless ?   
I do n’t know if that ’s healthy .
” 

“ Not emotionless .   
But … smarter about it .   
The idea I keep coming back to is I want to be a warrior monk .
” 

“
A warrior monk ?
” 

“ Just- centered when it counts , I guess ?
” 

“ Why the warrior part ?   
Do you envision yourself fighting ?
” 

“ I do n’t honestly know .   
It never occurred to me .
” 

Jessica smiled . 

“
What ’s next for Victoria Dallon ?
” she asked . 

“
You need to mock me , say Victoria Dallon , warrior monk , ” I said .   
“
I deserve it .
” 

“ I would n’t , ” she said .   
“ If everyone in costume could remain centered while doing what they do , it would make a world of difference .   
I think it ’s good .   
I ’d think about that more as you take your next steps .
” 

“ I know I want to move forward , because … I dunno .   
I feel like I ’m a shark that drowns if it stops moving , or a bird that drops out of the air like a stone if I ’m not flying forward .   
I know I need to get some of the basics of life squared away .   
I ’m
okay for money for a couple of months , but
I ca n’t stay on Crystal ’s couch .
” 

“
In my brief interactions with Crystal , I did like her , ” Jessica said . 

“
She ’s great .   
But not great to live with long - term , I do n’t think .   
You ’d never know it to look at her
, she ’s beautiful ,
she ’s fashionable , and very well put together , but if you looked at her apartment …
” 

I trailed off , using my expression to convey a bit of the horror to Jessica . 

“
Ah , ” Jessica said .   
She smiled again . 

“
I do n’t know what to do next .
” 

“
Well , I ’d think about how to apply the warrior monk role to your day to day life , ” she said .   
She pulled off her jacket .   
The weather had warmed up enough .   
“
What it means to you , why it ’s the first thing or the recurring thing in your thought processes .
” 

“ I just want to … do .
” 

“
You said you regretted yesterday , but Jasper thanked you .   
Would you rather have not done it ?   
Is it the ‘ want’ in wanting to do things that ’s problematic , or is it the ‘ do’ ?
” 

I drew in a deep breath .   
“
That ’s … a very complicated question , I think .
” 

“ You do n’t have to answer it right now , ” she said . 

“
I think I can , though .   
I think …
I had to .   
And as much as it was hard and cost me my job , I preferred it to the alternative .   
I ca n’t not do things that help out .   
I just want to do it in a good , centered way .
” 

“
Could it be a mundane job ?   
Construction ?   
Desk work ?   
Would you want to do something like you were doing with the patrol ?
” 

I thought about it . 

I could n’t see it .   
Not long - term . 

“
What ’s the first thing that comes to mind ?
” she asked . 

“
I think … fuck me , I think even now , I ca n’t quite see myself being anything but a hero .   
There are good people I ’ve gotten to know .   
People I want to protect and help .   
Like Gilpatrick , like Weld and Vista and my cousin and a couple of the teenagers I was working with in patrol block .   
You .   
I want good things for them .
” 

“
Thank you , ” she said .   
“
That means a lot to me .
” 

“ I ’ve been trying to convince myself there ’s some other way , but … I ca n’t not do anything .
” 

“
There ’s worse things .   
Especially if you can do it smart and centered .
” 

“ I do n’t want to be Glory Girl , ” I said .   
“
Someone remarked yesterday that they ’d thought she died and … good .   
She can stay dead .
” 

“
Sounds like you have an idea of what you ’re doing next .
” 

“
It ’s the wrong climate for it , ” I said .   
“
I just watched a team of heroes get eaten alive by the public .   
One took a bullet .
” 

“ Figure it out , ” she said . 

I frowned . 

“
Again , there ’s no rush , ” she said . 

“ I ca n’t sit still , ” I said .   
“
There ’s a bit of a rush .
” 

“ Touch base with me , ” she said .   
“
We ’ll go out for coffee , catch up .   
I can offer unofficial , more - friend - than - therapist advice .   
I think you ’ll figure it out , and I can give you a few nudges here and there .
” 

That gave me pause . 

“
You ’re not a therapist anymore ?
” I asked . 

“
Just the opposite , ” she said .   
“
I ’m very much a therapist .   
Ten hour days , six or seven days a week , and other peripheral obligations .   
I ’m afraid
I ’m not in a position to take you on as a patient again , Victoria , as much as I would dearly like to .
” 

That hurt .   
I did n’t want to say it , but it did hurt . 

“
I just joined the Wardens as a staff psychologist for their junior members and some special cases , and I ’m just not equipped , unfortunately .   
If you want it , I could try finding a colleague who you could talk to .   
Most are as busy as I am , so it might take a bit of time .
” 

I want you . 

I want- 

“
Sorry to take up your time today , when you ’re as busy as you are .
” 

“
It ’s more than alright , Victoria , ” she said .   
She was looking straight ahead as she talked , one hand on her jacket as she walked .   
“ With the hours I work , I lose objectivity .   
It becomes the work , and I lose sight of the patients .   
Sometimes it ’s hard to see the wins .   
Like
I said , you were a patient close to my own heart , and I thought you were one of the ones we lost .   
Seeing you , hearing you ?   
It means the world to me .   
It gives me a measure of hope .
” 

I nodded . 

She looked over at me .   
“
I ’ll reach out to a colleague .   
I ’ll see what I can do , if that ’s okay .   
Give you some reassurance there .
” 

“ I-
” I started . 

“
Yes ?
” 

“
It ’s okay , but
… if you wanted to reassure me-
” I said . 

It felt a little less like I could talk about certain topics with her , now . 

“
If it ’s within my power , I ’ll try anything , ” she said . 

“
My sister , ” I said , my voice soft .   
“ Send someone her way .
” 

Mrs. Yamada raised one eyebrow . 

I knew what she was thinking .   
She wondered if it was selflessness , or if I was a surprisingly good person .   
I was n’t . 

“
She ’s the scariest damn person in the world , Jessica , ” I said .   
“
And I do n’t think that ’s bias .   
There ’s a chance she ’s going to do something bad , and she ’s so damn powerful , that when and if it happens , it ’s going to be so much worse than what happened to me , and it ’s going to affect an awful lot more people .

Daylight streamed in at a low angle as I stepped back into my office .   
The light was blurred as it came through the condensation on the window , spotted with dots of darkness due to the melted frost that still clung to the window
’s surface in lines and constellations of droplets .   
Ninety percent of my books were packed up , the boxes that were still here were stacked near the door and the bookshelf , labeled in thick marker , with shorthand notes on the most interesting and essential files within written on the boxes in pen .   
I ’d left a few of the more interesting files available .   
I ’d put them in a box on their own , in case I needed something to read .
My phone was plugged into the computer .   
I checked it , and made a small and sleepy pump of my fist as it lit up .   
Then I saw the red number on the digital - display dial , and let my hand drop .   
Missed messages : too many .
It was n’t that I cared that much about the phone .   
It was that the phone being on meant there was power again .   
That the power was on again meant I could turn the space heater on .   
I flicked the switch , turned on my computer , then lit the candles for what little good heat they offered and wrapped a blanket around me before settling in my computer chair .
I was freshly showered , towel around my hair , and I ’d gotten dressed in a slightly musty spare change of clothes .   
I had a blanket , candles , and a computer booting up .   
I watched as it started the struggle of fighting every other computer out there that was wanting a piece of the web .
There were worse ways to take things easy on myself .
I slid my to - do list across the desk until it was beside my keyboard .   
I ’d need a car .   
Plenty of people were willing to offer the use of theirs in order to pay for fuel .   
Food , a place to stay .
Living accommodations might be tricky .   
Demand was high , and it was a pretty steep drop in quality from the central areas and the fringes .   
Many companies were putting up five or more houses a day or an apartment complex over the course of a week , slapping them together like there was a gun to their heads .   
When it came time to find renters , they were more interested in filling the spaces fast .   
They had no reason to answer questions or have a potential buyer investigating the nooks and crannies or checking the plumbing if they could turn that person away and have someone else on their doorstep within minutes .
It was a minefield .   
Word of mouth , cash , contacts , or luck were required to get a proper house that would n’t start falling apart after the fact .   
Fume Hood was one of the ones who ’d been unlucky .
In more than one way .
My homepage was parahumans online , though .   
On top of the missed calls and messages on my phone , I had a slew on the site .

I had no part in this .
I should have been smarter .
I did not know really
truly I marked it as unread and minimized it .   
I did n’t want to think about it for the moment .
News .   
Inquiry into the circumstances of Lachlan Hund .   
Not a trial , but an inquiry , some questions by people with more official standing .   
He ’d fallen in with some sketchy people , and there were thoughts about there being powers involved .
The inquiry was the story of the hour , it seemed .   
Heroes stood by to step in and take him away to get help if officials were suspicious he ’d been manipulated , but it was sounding like he would go home with his new family .   
That sucked .
Other articles , further down the pages .   
Fume Hood was alive , and she was a contentious topic .   
The actions on the part of the shooter seemed to have split people into two factions , with the ones supporting Fume Hood slightly edging out the ones who condemned her .   
Strange to see .
I wanted more info on her situation , and unfortunately , that was all I got .
I added another note to my to - do list .   
I ’d reach out to Fume Hood , check in .   
I ’d satisfy my curiosity and nag her about the name choice , which I ’d been meaning to do but had n’t had the chance to .
My eye traveled up to the unread messages .   
Crystal ’s responses .
It all felt like I was taking a massive backward step .   
Like I was back in the immediate aftermath of Gold Morning .   
Two legs , two arms , bewildered , emotional .   
I was bothered , upset .   
I did n’t know what to do with myself .
I ’d been angry at my parents then too .   
For various reasons .   
Angry at a lot of people and things .
I had n’t and did n’t want that to define me .
I clicked on Crystal ’s account name again .

More news articles .   
Some capes were taking on roles as icons and iconoclasts for the various movements in the civilian sectors .   
Four hero teams led the ‘ icon’ groups .   
Advance Guard , Foresight , the Shepherds and the Attendant .
The first two were aimed at pushing forward .   
New approaches , doing things right this time .   
The opinions on what that way forward looked like it differed , feeding into the division between the two groups .
Things were changing .   
The Shepherds and Attendant had been groups divided along similar lines , but the Shepherds were self - combusting , and the remaining members were folding into the Attendant .   
There was some debate over what the name of the resulting team would be .
And then there were three , I thought .
I idly browsed , caught between liking the Shepherd ’s aesthetic and icons better while liking the Attendant ’s mindset of moving slowly , with caution .   
I was suspicious
it might end up being the opposite .   
As it was , the Attendant ’s approach tacked on a bit too much ‘ remember what we lost’ for my liking , clinging to the past , being defined by it , but-
There was a knock on the door .
“
Come in , ” I said .
Gil opened the door .   
He had two coffees in a tray in one hand and a bag in the other , and he had to juggle them both as he opened the door .
I rose to my feet .
“ Sit , ” he said .   
He nearly dropped his drink as he saw the boxes .   
“ Shit on me , you ’re packed .
”
“ I ’ll be done in time to be gone before the students turn up , ” I said , sitting .
“
I ’m not so concerned about that right now , ” he said .   
He put the bag and coffees on the desk .   
“
How are you ?
” I shrugged .
“ You look better .
”
I had a headache from not sleeping and not eating , and from the post - stress hangover , but I also felt lighter than air in a euphoric , fragile way .   
It was as if I ’d just gotten over a bad round of the flu , and I was at the point where I was getting over the worst of it , but if I did the wrong thing or tested my body in the wrong way I ’d be sick and hurting again .
Better .
I shrugged again .   
“
Yeah .   
That word could apply .
”
“
Did you sleep at all ?
”
I snorted air out of my nose .   
“
I ’ll sleep when I ’m so tired
I have no other choice .
”
“
But you ’re feeling better than you were ?
”
“
Yeah .   
Better than I was .   
Thanks for letting me stay over , ” I said .
He pulled a breakfast burger out of the paper bag , and my eyes must have lit up , because he smiled , passing it to me .
A double - decker English muffin , with bacon , two eggs , lettuce , tomato and very sharp mustard .
I was n’t normally one to eat egg , but I did n’t let that stop me .
I ’d taken too big of a bite .   
I swallowed hard .
It was good .   
Visceral .   
Like Snag ’s power , the hit of emotion as I enjoyed it was like a bit of metal , closing an electrical connection .   
Rounding off a thought I had n’t wanted to make .
Feeding tubes .   
The insertions , the removals .   
The tube being there , one eye watching the beige fluid moving through steadily .   
Really wanting something good .   
Going almost four months without , because they were n’t sure I could .   
Then having it be a chore .   
It had been better than the alternative , but a chore , to force myself to eat it right , to chew it thoroughly enough .
I swallowed hard again , not because I had another bite to swallow .
Gilpatrick was looking at my files and notes , his back to me , my English muffin sandwich in my hands .
He glanced at me , saw the blinking , and looked away .   
“
If you want to talk , I ’m all ears .
”
“ I do n’t , thank you , ” I said .   
“
I had a bad day , the part you knew about , then it got worse .   
Now I ’m trying to get centered . ”
He nodded .
“
This is really good , ” I said .
“ They are , I took a bite of mine in the car and then ate it before I got here , ” he said .   
He bent over a box , looking at the notes .   
“ Man , I wish I still had access to these files and books .   
I ’d try bribing you if I could do it in good conscience .
” I swallowed again .   
“
They ’re mine
and I ’m too straightlaced to be bribed .   
You can call me if you want to ask about any of it .
”
“
Then I owe you more favors , am I right ?
”
“ I thought we were n’t counting anymore , ” I said .
He did n’t respond to that .   
He picked up a file , paging through it .
“
Which one is that ?
”
“ Ossuary .   
Why leave it out ?
”
“
They ’re back , or they will be soon , ”
I said .   
“ Activist villains with a heavy focus on environment .   
They would n’t call themselves villains , I do n’t think .   
Long list of really messy executions , longer list of leaders with very short tenures , who try to pull a very disparate group together , fail , and abdicate .
”
“ Were they the ones who used to call themselves Elephant Graveyard ?
”
“
That ’s the one .   
One of the early leaders pushed the name change along with a shift away from focusing on animals and animal welfare , ” I said .   
“
I liked Elephant Graveyard more , I think .   
Clunky , but clunky in a way that stands out , and it made for really good imagery , when they left a spray painted calling card .
”
“ I do n’t want to pry , ” Gilpatrick said .
“ About Ossuary ?
”
“ About you .   
I spent a while thinking about what to do .   
I ’ve had some good bosses and bad bosses over the years .   
When you throw yourself into the fray like you do when you ’re a PRT squaddie , you really need to know that the people above you are looking out for you .   
That your back is covered .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
Same applied to family , to parents .
“ I do n’t want to push boundaries or cross any lines , and I do n’t want to ask the wrong thing .   
When you say you do n’t want to talk , can I ask why ?   
Any answer you gave could help me make sure
I ’m
covering your back as you move on to better things .
”
“
Because I ’d have to fill you in on years of background and that ’s not stuff
I want to relive ,
” I said .
“
Ah .
”
“
Because it ’s confidential , because it ’s messy , because … as cool as a guy as you can be , you ca n’t make it better .   
You ca n’t give me the answers or guidance I need because there ’s a whole ream of things that ’s separate and aside from the years of my background that you ’d need to get into or know
and … I ’m going overboard with this .
”
“ I do want to hear , ” he said .   
“
Anything else ?
”
“
That ’s mostly it , ” I said .
He nodded .   
He rubbed his head for a second , thinking .   
“
You want company ?
”
“ Nah , ” I said .   
“
I ’d just be packing the last few boxes .   
I would n’t mind a hand getting them out to the car , just to speed things up when the time comes .
”
“ You have a car ?
”
“ I ’ll get someone off of a listing or something .   
I ’ve got to figure out what I ’m doing ,
so there ’s that too .   
I would n’t be good company , while I ’m working through all of that .
”
“ You do n’t have to be packed up and gone today , ” he said .
“
I kind of need to , ” I said .
He nodded , rubbing his head again .   
“ I ’ll cover the car .   
I ’ll pay the driver .
”
“
Thank you , ” I said .
“ You know where to find me .   
Place is empty , so you can shout from the stairs
and I ’ll hear you .
”
“
Right , ” I said .
“
I ’m going to head to my office .   
I ’ve got something to do .
”
I gave him a little salute .
Energized by food and coffee , still feeling lightweight , I worked on getting my boxes packed up .   
Along the way , I slotted my files and folders into the box I ’d reserved for the most pertinent factors .   
The villains of the area , the heroes , and the villains turned hero .   
The hoods .
The day was warming up .   
The light from the sun was warm enough to counteract the lower temperature .   
By midday , if yesterday was any indication , it would be short - sleeves and shorts weather again .
A message popped up on my screen .
♦   
Private Messages from Glitzglam :
Glitzglam : game plan .

u & I raid ur dads place while he at work , get ur stuff .   
standard attack formation , I play defense , make sure coast is clear , I support you , u take point and do what u need I fired off my response .   
That worked .   
I had a couch to sleep on .
One thing off of my to - do list .   
I liked the progress .   
Progress was good .   
So long as I moved forward , I could stay aloft .
I cleared off the remainder of the bookshelves , stacking the boxes .   
I scribbled out my notes on the lid , checking the contents .
There was a knock at the door .
“
Come in , ” I said .
Gilpatrick .
“ Time for me to go ?
” I asked .
“ Nah , ” he said .   
“
There ’s a bit .   
I do n’t want to force you out the door like that .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .   
I raised an eyebrow .
“ I was thinking , over the past twelve hours , if you were my student , I would n’t want to let you go with things like this .   
Normally I ’d contact a guardian .
”
My heart skipped a beat at that .   
No .
“
But you said last night you had a family thing to do .   
I can connect dots .
” I nodded .
“ I made some phone calls , ” he said .
He stepped out of the doorway .
Mrs. Yamada .   
Shorter than me , hair tied back in a simple ponytail , wearing a skirt , white top , and jacket , with a simple , short string of pearls at her collarbone .
“
Oh wow , ” she said .   
“ Look at you .
”
I did n’t have words , so I just lifted my arms to either side and let them fall .
“
Is this okay ?
” Gilpatrick asked .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
I swallowed .   
“
Yeah .   
Just about perfect .
”
“
I ’ll leave you to it , ” he said .
Jessica blinked a few times , before fanning herself .   
“
I ’m a little misty eyed .   
Sorry .
”
I was a little misty eyed myself .
“
Can I give you a hug ?
” she asked .   
When I nodded , she did so .   
I hugged her back .
“ You put me down as your emergency contact ?
” she asked .
“
Sorry , ” I said .   
“ I-
I honestly forgot
I did that .   
It was more than a year ago .
”
I ’d had to name someone , and I had n’t named my parents because-
Because .
“
It ’s more than alright , ” she said .   
“
Your boss said he was worried about you .
”
I opened my mouth to reply , and then the waterworks started instead .
⊙ Jessica slammed the back hatch of her car , most of the boxes settled inside .
“
Do you want to walk ?
” she asked .   
“ Around the block , maybe ?   
Or we could step back inside .
”
If I was going to start crying again .
Students were just now starting to appear , and I did n’t want to sit still .
“ We can walk , ” I said .
“ It ’s been amazing to hear your voice , ” she said .   
“ I know you were often frustrated , trying to communicate with the means you had available .   
I was frustrated too , but I was n’t allowed to say that .
”
“
I could tell , ” I said .
“ You were a challenging patient , those first few months- ” I snorted .
“
-but much like many teachers say they grow to care most about the class clowns and problem students , I came to hold you close to my heart .   
I wanted so badly to give you answers and to hear you out without having to rely on text to speech and letters you wrote between appointments .   
I wanted to dialogue , and it was so very hard to do that .
”
“
It was , ” I said .
Why was it so much easier to talk about the things that I could n’t normally even think about , like this ?
“
How did you find your way back from that ?
”
How did I become Victoria again , instead of the wretched thing in the hospital room , or in the home for invalids ?
“
My sister , ” I said , my voice soft .
“
Oh .   
That ’s not an easy thing , ” she said .
“
No , ” I said , my voice even softer .
I ’d already filled her in on the details of yesterday and the past few months .   
She ’d offered a listening ear .   
I ’d spent all night working out my next few steps , I knew what the situation was , I did n’t really need more angles to view it from .
This , though … if I was going to make the most of the time I had with her here , then I wanted to at least get a handle on this .
“
We were all brought to the battlefield during Gold Morning .   
There ’s …
that ’s a hard topic to field .
”
“
There ’s an unspoken agreement that the civilians do n’t get to know , ” she said .
“
But you ’re not really a civilian , ” I said .
“
No , ” she said .   
“
I ’ve heard reports .   
Some from very close to the center of the action .   
I know what happened .
”
“ Body , mind , and heart , you know how that ’s a thing ?
” I asked .
“
Yes .
”
“ I lost my body , two years before Gold Morning .   
My heart was … twisted into something unrecognizable .
”
“
Yes .
”
“
And … Gold Morning hit .   
And the-
” I paused .   
There were people on the street , walking toward the school gate and the various block buildings as we walked away from it all .   
A tide we walked against .   
I had to shut up until people were mostly out of earshot .   
“
And I was controlled in mind .   
I did n’t have much , but I could make my decisions .   
I could decide to use my power or not .   
She took that away from me , for a brief time .
”
“
I ’ve talked to a number of people who had a very hard time with that .
”
“ You know who she was ?
”
“ I do .
”
I nodded to myself .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
My sister told me .
”
Even if I was free to talk , the words still carried their ugly weight .   
The words and associated mental pictures still dragged my mood down .
“
She knew me or knew of me , or she knew my sister .   
She decided in the end that she ’d put my sister right next to me .   
She did n’t do that for many people at all , as far as I can tell .
”
“
And your sister healed you ?
”
“
Gave me a body again .   
Um .   
She made me seventeen again .   
Walked back the clock , as if it …
I do n’t know .   
So she did n’t take two years of my life from me in body , like she did in everything else .   
I ’m
physically nineteen now , apparently .
”
“
You said body , mind and spirit .   
She fixed one of the three .   
Did she undo the effect on your emotions ?
”
I drew in a breath , sighed heavily .   
I nodded .   
“
She actually- she turned off my emotions .   
Suppressed them .   
Then she asked me what I wanted .
”
“
What did you want ?
”
“ I remember thinking , you know , it was really possible
she wanted me to say that I wanted to go back to liking her .   
And if she did think that , then it was unconscionable .   
Divorced from all emotion , I thought it was unconscionable .
”
“ Okay .
”
“ And divorced from all emotion , I thought I ’d be fair .   
That I ’d give her the benefit of a doubt .   
That I ’d assume that was n’t what she meant or wanted .   
I told her I wanted to remember .
”
“
To remember ?
”
“
Those two years , ” I said , my voice hollow .   
I drew in another deep breath .
Further down the street , a nine or ten year old boy with straight black hair and brown skin looked at Jessica , his eyes widening , then he looked at me .   
He raised his hand , extending it toward Jessica as they passed one another .
She gave him a high five , then pushed his head , sending him on his way , toward the school .
“ They were n’t good years .
”
“ Rationally ?   
Divorced from emotion ?   
I knew .   
I ca n’t forgive her .   
Ever .   
I ca n’t forget what she did , or she might do it again .   
To someone else .   
To me .   
I told her to fix my feelings and leave my brain alone otherwise .
”
“
It ’s a heavy weight to carry , ” she said .
“
Those two years are really damn heavy , ” I said .   
“ Everything else is .   
But I ’ve been holding on to that moment .   
I hate that I hold onto it , because she did it , but everything is tainted by her , so what can I do ?
”
“ You hold onto it ?   
How ?
”
“ Being emotionless , putting those feelings away .   
My feelings and impulses got me into that whole mess in the first place .   
I hurt an awful lot of awful people , you know .
”
“ We ’ve talked about that .   
You wrote letters outlining your thoughts and how you wanted to apologize to some of those affected .
”
“ My entire life leading up to that basketball game , I wanted so horribly badly to be a hero , you know ?   
It felt like I thought about it every ten minutes .   
My parents were heroes , my cousin was , my aunt and uncle were , and everything revolved around it .   
I wanted it all so badly it hurt , and I did n’t have it for years .   
Then that basketball game , and I wanted to have something where I was the hero , where I got to stand out .   
Because sometimes it felt like my parents did n’t see me .
”
“ That ’s been a recurring idea .   
You talked about their missed visits .
”
“ They came a lot , ” I said .   
“
I know that .   
My dad more than my mom .   
But every missed visit was a horrible thing , and the little things mattered so much when I had nothing else .   
Um .   
And this basketball game , I know I ’ve talked about this before .   
But this one girl kicked my freaking ass .   
In my face , knocking me over , intercepting every pass , blocking every shot .   
She did n’t have any powers or anything , she was just … good .   
Better .
”
“ A lot of things came into focus in that moment .
”
“ Every time she or one of her teammates beat me , I could see the look of disappointment on my parent ’s faces .   
In the other moments , they looked so bored .   
And it was boring , you know .   
No parent wants to go sit through amateurs doing badly at a high school sport .
”
“ Some do .
”
“
Anyway , she hit me hard , she said something about me being overrated , and it was the last straw .   
Realizing I stood so far from family , that I did n’t want to be there , but I had no other choice , my sternum was hurting where she ’d driven her elbow into me .   
I got my powers .
”
“ Years of wanting , leading up to that .
”
She ’d caught the thread I ’d wanted to lay out .   
It helped .   
“
And then just under three years as Victoria - slash - Glory - Girl .   
And then … hospital .
”
“
Which was undeniably horrible .
”
“
It felt like my life had ended .   
No hope or help .   
All I had to cling to were those memories of the three years I was Glory Girl .   
I could look back , think about every fight , every encounter .   
The ones I was proud of .   
The ones I was n’t .   
I had so much regret , replaying events out in my head .   
It started with me thinking about- that moment when it all went so wrong .   
When she messed with my emotions , then going backward .
”
Emotions caught me .   
I made my expression a scowl , because I was worried what my face might do otherwise .
“ I was such a stupid fucking kid , ” I said .
“
That ’s allowed , ” she said .
I shook my head .   
“
Not when you ’re as strong as I am .
”
“
And you want to be emotionless ?   
I do n’t know if that ’s healthy .
”
“ Not emotionless .   
But … smarter about it .   
The idea I keep coming back to is I want to be a warrior monk .
”
“ A warrior monk ?
”
“
Just- centered when it counts , I guess ?
”
“
Why the warrior part ?   
Do you envision yourself fighting ?
”
“ I do n’t honestly know .   
It never occurred to me .
” Jessica smiled .
“
What ’s next for Victoria Dallon ?
” she asked .
“ You need to mock me , say Victoria Dallon , warrior monk , ” I said .   
“
I deserve it .
”
“ I would n’t , ” she said .   
“ If everyone in costume could remain centered while doing what they do , it would make a world of difference .   
I think it ’s good .   
I ’d think about that more as you take your next steps .
”
“ I know I want to move forward , because … I dunno .   
I feel like I ’m a shark that drowns if it stops moving , or a bird that drops out of the air like a stone if I ’m not flying forward .   
I know I need to get some of the basics of life squared away .   
I ’m
okay for money for a couple of months , but
I ca n’t stay on Crystal ’s couch .
”
“ In my brief interactions with Crystal , I did like her , ” Jessica said .
“
She ’s great .   
But not great to live with long - term , I do n’t think .   
You ’d never know it to look at her
, she ’s beautiful ,
she ’s fashionable , and very well put together , but if you looked at her apartment …
”
I trailed off , using my expression to convey a bit of the horror to Jessica .
“
Ah , ” Jessica said .   
She smiled again .
“ I do n’t know what to do next .
”
“
Well , I ’d think about how to apply the warrior monk role to your day to day life , ” she said .   
She pulled off her jacket .   
The weather had warmed up enough .   
“
What it means to you , why it ’s the first thing or the recurring thing in your thought processes .
”
“
I just want to … do .
”
“ You said you regretted yesterday , but Jasper thanked you .   
Would you rather have not done it ?   
Is it the ‘ want’ in wanting to do things that ’s problematic , or is it the ‘ do’ ?
” I drew in a deep breath .   
“
That ’s … a very complicated question , I think .
”
“ You do n’t have to answer it right now , ” she said .
“ I think I can , though .   
I think …
I had to .   
And as much as it was hard and cost me my job , I preferred it to the alternative .   
I ca n’t not do things that help out .   
I just want to do it in a good , centered way .
”
“
Could it be a mundane job ?   
Construction ?   
Desk work ?   
Would you want to do something like you were doing with the patrol ?
”
I thought about it .
I could n’t see it .   
Not long - term .
“
What ’s the first thing that comes to mind ?
” she asked .
“ I think … fuck me , I think even now , I ca n’t quite see myself being anything but a hero .   
There are good people I ’ve gotten to know .   
People I want to protect and help .   
Like Gilpatrick , like Weld and Vista and my cousin and a couple of the teenagers I was working with in patrol block .   
You .   
I want good things for them .
”
“
Thank you , ” she said .   
“
That means a lot to me .
”
“ I ’ve been trying to convince myself there ’s some other way , but … I ca n’t not do anything .
”
“
There ’s worse things .   
Especially if you can do it smart and centered .
”
“ I do n’t want to be Glory Girl , ” I said .   
“
Someone remarked yesterday that they ’d thought she died and … good .   
She can stay dead .
”
“
Sounds like you have an idea of what you ’re doing next .
”
“
It ’s the wrong climate for it , ” I said .   
“
I just watched a team of heroes get eaten alive by the public .   
One took a bullet .
”
“ Figure it out , ” she said .
I frowned .
“
Again , there ’s no rush , ” she said .
“ I ca n’t sit still , ” I said .   
“
There ’s a bit of a rush .
”
“ Touch base with me , ” she said .   
“
We ’ll go out for coffee , catch up .   
I can offer unofficial , more - friend - than - therapist advice .   
I think you ’ll figure it out , and I can give you a few nudges here and there .
”
That gave me pause .
“
You ’re not a therapist anymore ?
” I asked .
“
Just the opposite , ” she said .   
“
I ’m very much a therapist .   
Ten hour days , six or seven days a week , and other peripheral obligations .   
I ’m afraid
I ’m not in a position to take you on as a patient again , Victoria , as much as I would dearly like to .
”
That hurt .   
I did n’t want to say it , but it did hurt .
“ I just joined the Wardens as a staff psychologist for their junior members and some special cases , and I ’m just not equipped , unfortunately .   
If you want it , I could try finding a colleague who you could talk to .   
Most are as busy as I am , so it might take a bit of time .
” I want you .
I want-
“
Sorry to take up your time today , when you ’re as busy as you are .
”
“
It ’s more than alright , Victoria , ” she said .   
She was looking straight ahead as she talked , one hand on her jacket as she walked .   
“ With the hours I work , I lose objectivity .   
It becomes the work , and I lose sight of the patients .   
Sometimes it ’s hard to see the wins .   
Like
I said , you were a patient close to my own heart , and I thought you were one of the ones we lost .   
Seeing you , hearing you ?   
It means the world to me .   
It gives me a measure of hope .
” I nodded .
She looked over at me .   
“
I ’ll reach out to a colleague .   
I ’ll see what I can do , if that ’s okay .   
Give you some reassurance there .
”
“ I- ” I started .
“
Yes ?
”
“
It ’s okay , but
… if you wanted to reassure me-
” I said .
It felt a little less like I could talk about certain topics with her , now .
“
If it ’s within my power , I ’ll try anything , ” she said .
“
My sister , ” I said , my voice soft .   
“ Send someone her way .
”
Mrs. Yamada raised one eyebrow .
I knew what she was thinking .   
She wondered if it was selflessness , or if I was a surprisingly good person .   
I was n’t .








“ The Wardens are cooperating with seven major cape teams and , last I checked , ten minor teams .   
We are not a monolithic entity .   
We are not an authority .   
We are not the bad guys , Julia .
”
I rummaged through a cabinet .   
My life was in boxes , from my clothes to my hair and skin stuff to my files .   
If it were that alone , it would have been tolerable .   
I ’d tried using logic and going to the most common sense places .  
Not in or among the dirty dishes , not in the various jars and vases of spoons and spatulas on the counter , not behind or under something .   
I ’d checked the other rooms in the apartment .
“ People are worried .   
You have Legend as a second in command , and memories are n’t so short that we do n’t remember the Alexandria fiasco .
” I moved methodically through the kitchen , left to right , while the television played on a low volume .
“ I can tell you this : all we want to do is help .   
We want to find the right capes for the major crises and we want to equip the teams out there with information and resources .
“
“
That ’s admirable , but- “ “
No , wait , hold on , Julia .   
You told me when you asked me to have a chat with you on camera that you wanted to have a conversation .   
Let me say this .
”
I looked at the little TV in the corner of the kitchen .
“ … that people are going to draw on what they know to fill the blanks , when they do n’t have enough information .   
I understand that the closest parallel that many Americans draw to the Wardens is the PRT .   
Give us time to make our impression and show how we operate , ” Chevalier said .
“
Would you not say there are quite a few of those blanks when it comes to your organization ?
” the reporter asked .
“
I accepted this interview because I want to fill some of those blanks .
”
“
Are you an open book , then ?
”
My eyebrows went up .   
That was dirty pool from reporter Julia .   
There was no way that question would n’t be followed by something that Chevalier could n’t or would n’t want to answer , cornering him .
“
Some of those blanks , ” Chevalier said , stressing the ‘ some’ .   
“
We ’re still figuring things out , we ’re still finding our footing and we ’re negotiating a comfortable and healthy position with the public , the various teams under our umbrella , teams that are n’t under our umbrella , and the authorities .   
The lack of answers and the number of blanks is n’t me being evasive or underhanded .   
It ’s that the Wardens and society as a whole have a lot of figuring out to do .
”
He was good at what he did , and he did a lot .   
I wished I was in a position to study what he was saying and how he was fielding the questions , but I had more hunting to do .
I went back to the drawers I ’d already checked , pulling out the cutlery drawer enough that I could check the back , behind the tray that held the forks and knives .   
I was too used to drawers having a mechanism that stopped them once they were pulled out to their limit , and I ’d expected it to be longer , which led to me pulling the drawer straight out of its housing .
I only barely caught it , sticking my knee out under it and moving my hands to grab the sides .   
The cutlery rattled loudly , with a few miscellaneous cheese and holiday themed knives clattering to the floor .
“ … would you say about the rumors circulating around Valkyrie , then ?
” I put the drawer on the countertop , collected the fallen knives , and sorted through the contents , lifting up the tray to make sure nothing had fallen beneath .   
No luck .
I tried to put the drawer back , failed a few times before realizing that the construction was n’t especially sturdy , and that the back end had pulled a bit loose .   
I fixed it , then resumed trying to put it back inside the hole it was meant for .
There was the saying : affordable , nice , or safe and sane .   
Pick one .   
It was a chronic problem with the speed they were trying to get buildings and houses up .   
Shoddy construction , rush jobs , cut corners , mistakes , and general ugliness were pretty normal .   
I was hopeful that in a little while we might be able to get to a point where it was ‘ pick two’ instead of ‘ pick one’ , but we had a ways to go .
I tried to squeeze the end together where two pieces did n’t quite meet and simultaneously push it in with my stomach .   
It refused to slide in .
“
What are you doing to my kitchen ?
”
Crystal was in the doorway , her hair a mess .   
She wore an oversized t - shirt and pyjama shorts , and she still looked half asleep .
“
Did I wake you ?
” I asked .
“
Uh huh , ” she said , sleepy .   
“
Do n’t tell me you ’re a morning person .   
That would be a problem .
”
“
I ’m not .   
I ’m a person who fell asleep early last night-
”
“ Almost right after eating .   
Yep .   
And now you ’re up , showered , dressed , and you ’re dismantling my kitchen .   
For reasons .
”
“ I woke up and thought I ’d keep my normal work routine while I figure out what I ’m doing .
”
“
Renovating my kitchen ?
”
“
I ’m trying to find scissors , ” I said .   
“
I ’d settle for a sharp knife .
”
Crystal smiled wide , her eyes still sleepy .   
She grabbed a glass from a cabinet , and she half - walked , half - floated across the kitchen .
“
Do n’t laugh , ” I said .
“
You ’re such a cliche , ” she said , as she passed me on her way to the sink .   
“
Oh my god , Victoria .   
You ’re that person with super strength that trashes everything she touches .
”
“ Just help me , ” I said .
She reached over and helped me hold the drawer together .   
As it slid into the confines of the front of the counter , the framing held it together where the drawer ’s own construction would n’t .
“
I was n’t using my super strength , for the record , ” I said .
“
Yeah .   
I ’ve done that with the drawers before ,
I ’m just making fun of you .   
It ’s a funny image , to walk into the kitchen and see that .
”
“ Ah ha , ” I said .   
“
Then can I make fun of you for having two big jars of spatulas , whisks , spaghetti scoops , having two food processors-
”
“
One was a gift .
”
“ -And
no scissors or shears anywhere I can find ?   
I ’d settle for a sharp knife .   
You have those steak knives , but they look nice and I do n’t want to use them for the wrong thing and ruin them .
”
She reached across the counter to get the package of bacon , holding it up .   
It was inside a hard plastic tupperware - like container with a small black and white label stuck to it .   
A mark stamped on it had it sourced from another world .   
Even without the mark , the pricetag might have given it away .
“
Thought
I ’d treat you to breakfast , ” I said .   
“ Went for a walk to get some stuff .
”
Still appearing half asleep , she moved one hand , creating a deep red forcefield behind the bacon , then she produced a thin laser from her fingertip , slicing off the end of the package .
She handed the bacon to me , open end up .
“ You do n’t have scissors ?
”
She shook her head , smiling .
I sighed , picking up the bowl where I ’d already mixed the dry ingredients .   
“ Fruit crepes , bacon on the side ?
”
“
Sounds amazing , ” she said , leaning against the counter , eyes mostly closed .
“
You look beat , ” I said .
“ It was pretty unforgiving , being there .   
I timed everything so I could unwind starting with the barbecue , and unwinding did n’t happen .
” I nodded .   
“ Sorry .
”
“
That ’s not on you .
”
“
I ’m still sorry it happened .
”
“ You slept okay though ?
”
“ I slept a solid ten hours .   
I just … started sleeping at six thirty or something .   
Then I woke up ,
I started thinking , and I decided to be productive .   
I ’m talking to some teams today .
”
“ If you want me to put a good word in with my guys , I ’d be happy to .
”
“ I do n’t want to do the quasi - military cape thing , ” I said .   
“ A little bit too intense .
”
“
Yeah , ” Crystal said .   
“
I ’m so physically tired , two days out ,
that I ’m not
sure I would be standing if I could n’t fly .
”
I looked down at the ground .   
Her feet were barely touching the ground .
It was n’t the physical intensity that worried me .   
It was the mental and emotional cost .   
It was the fact that when it came to the military and the military - like stuff , the trend was to beat the individual into shape .   
Organization , conformity .
I could n’t take much more of the harsh lessons on identity or the forced redefining of the self .
“
I ’m just waking up , so forgive me if I got something wrong , but did you already find a place ?
”
I shook my head .
“
You    took the sheets off the couch .
” I looked over at the living room .   
There were boxes stacked around , and only half were mine .
“
You said you might have friends over at some point , I thought it ’d be weird if you had to navigate around my stuff , so I moved it out of the way .
”
“
Okay , ” she said .   
She paused .   
“
I ’m tired , so I want to make sure I say this right .
”
I went to the fridge to get the fruit stuff I ’d already prepared .
“
I do n’t care , ” she said .   
“
First of all , I know I have a lot of stuff .   
You know I have a lot of stuff .
”
I looked at the stuff around the kitchen and adjacent living room .   
It was a bit messy , to the point counter space and table space was occupied .
“
Just-
I really do n’t care if you add your stuff to it .   
I like my places feeling lived in .   
Some of the stuff is a friend ’s , and they ’ll take it when they get set up .   
Some is mom and dad
’s .   
Some is yours , and that ’s fine .   
That leads me to my second point .   
I want you to be here .   
I want you to feel comfortable .
”
“ Thank you .
”
“ I know my couch is n’t much , but you need a place that you can kick your shoes off and leave them where they are .
”
I might have mentioned that I was n’t quite that personality type , but I held my tongue .   
I understood the sentiment , what she wanted .
“ I want you to have a place that ’s yours , Vic .
” ⊙ “ I ’ll start by asking this : why not be independent ?
”
Foresight had a strong aesthetic running through their costumes .   
Primary among those things was a mask or helmet design where each of the members of the team lacked eyeholes .   
Helmets with opaque visors , masks without eyes .   
The aesthetic involved lots of paneled body armor and loose fabric elsewhere , with iconography worked into the panels .   
It made me think of ninjas from movies , with the mix of lightweight costumes and armor , but without the Eastern style .
Their team symbol was a stylized eye , sans pupil , with a wildly exaggerated ‘ 4’ struck out in bold lines that extended well past the curved lines of the eye .
I was wearing my best civilian clothes .   
I ’d opted to leave the mask off .   
I sat in a chair .   
Two of them sat in chairs in the office , and another two stood at the side .
I gave my answer .   
“
If I ’m being entirely honest , independent does n’t pay unless you ’re really good .   
At the risk of sounding arrogant , in another time and place , I think I could scrape by because I do have that experience , I have the knowledge , and I can hold my own .
”
“ You do n’t think you could do it now ?
”
Countenance asked .   
He was the second in command and the highest ranking team member in the room .   
His outfit was heavier and draped more than the others , both in how the cloth hung loose and how the armor panels were connected so they dangled from the piece above .   
The Foresight icon was in the center of his mask , like a cyclopean eye .
“ I know who Foresight is and how you operate , ” I said .   
“ I know you want to move forward , you ’re interested in helping the little guys , tackling the right issues , and take decisive , needed action in a calculated , smart way .
”
“ You read our webpage .
”
“ I ’ve been following Foresight since it started , ” I said .   
“
Whatever answer    you give me today
, I ’ll be following you guys from here on out , because I think it ’s important to know the lay of the land .   
Which goes back to what I was saying .   
Being calculated , being smart .   
I ’ve been watching and researching you guys , and I ’m sure you have the mentality where , from the time I reached out about an interview , you were looking me up and asking questions .   
Which means you heard about the incident at the Norfair community center .
”
“
Yes .   
We talked to your reference about it .   
I imagine he talked to you ?
”
“ He did n’t , but he ’s busy and this interview happened on short notice , ” I said .   
“
Everything that unfolded there and a lot of what I see elsewhere
, it suggests that it would be really hard to make it as an independent .   
Too many want to blame parahumans for what happened , and both independents and fledgling teams are easily targeted .   
Established teams absorb and diffuse that impact .   
That aside , being part of a team , cooperating , having the information and sharing that information , it ’s too crucial .   
That ’s why I ’m not going independent , given the chance .   
I want to help build something .
” Countenance nodded .   
He reached over to his friend , who handed over the paperwork he ’d been reading .   
He looked down .   
“
Your reference sang your praises .
”
“
He ’s a great guy .   
I really respect what he ’s trying to do with something as tricky as the patrol block .
”
“ Our problem , when it comes to assessing any candidate , is that each person we add to our teams is added strength , added power , but they ’re also a possible set of complications .   
It forces us to strike a balance .   
We ’re smaller than many of our peers because we ’re selective .   
We want to make sure anyone we add will be a good fit , with minimal complications .
”
“ I reached out to Foresight first , to you , because I like how you do things .   
It ’s what and who I want to be .
”
“
Then my next question to you would be what you think is going to happen next , ” Countenance said .
“ What I think is going to happen ?   
I think trouble is incoming .   
We see hints of it , the out - of - control triggers , we hear about some scary monsters and then the big names go and try to handle it
, then we have other circumstances where the big names are running off to go handle things that they do n’t tell anyone about .   
I think those situations might be worse than the monsters .   
So far , Gimel is untouched by the worst of it .   
We ’ve been on top of things .   
But sooner or later , something is going to hit us that we are n’t prepared for and ca n’t neatly handle .
”
“
What do you think happens then ?
”
“ I think it depends a lot on us having the right information and tools .
”
Beside Countenance , Anelace was nodding .   
Anelace was a young guy , his costume the opposite of Countenance ’s in how it was tighter - fitting , his mask bearing a dark gray dagger illustration on the right side of the white surface in the same exaggerated style the ‘ 4’ was drawn on the emblem on his chest .   
The knotted area where hilt , blade , and the two prongs of the guard all met was located where one of his eyes would be .
“
You said you know how we operate ?
”
“ Support work with the megalopolis and police , patrols and events for the day to day .   
Several times a week you make calculated , strategic strikes on priority targets .   
It ’s like what the Wardens are doing with the big , scary threats , but you ’re more city - focused than whatever ’s going on outside of Gimel .   
A lot of your members go on to work with them , which is why you have openings .
”
“ She does her research , ” Anelace said .
“ She does , ” Countenance said .   
He said it in a way that suggested he was admitting it , almost reluctant .
My heart sank .
I looked over my shoulder .   
The two at the side of the room were Effervescent and Relay .
Effervescent was an emotion manipulator with an emphasis on stunning people .   
Relay was capable of some complex moves with teleportation
I was n’t sure I had a grasp on , most of which seemed to amount to them teleporting to where others were , shunting that person to a random position elsewhere , and he also had some ability to communicate without words , both sending and receiving .
“
Can I ask ?
” I asked .
“
Ask ? ”
Countenance asked me .
I indicated the pair .   
“
I get the impression they ’re communicating something to you , and you sound like you ’re winding up to tell me no .   
Both took some shifts at the portals , watching the refugees as they came in to make sure there was no trouble , which makes me think they ’re thinkers , they read people , and they ’re reading me .
”
Countenance turned his head to fix the cyclopean , drawn eye on the pair .
“
I ca n’t get a consistent read on you emotionally , ” Effervescent said .   
“
It ’s repressed .
”
“
My long - time boyfriend was an emotion manipulator .   
He had a hard time getting a read on me too ,
” I said .
“
I ’m better than most when it comes to getting reads , ” Effervescent said .   
“
No offense , but it ’s what is n’t as repressed that concerns me .
”
“
Enough
you ’d say no , ” Countenance said .
Effervescent nodded .
“ Relay ?
”
“
My read was fine .   
Minimal secondary noise .
”
“
Sorry , ” Countenance said .   
“ For reading you without permission .   
It ’d be a point in your favor that you caught on , but- ”
“
But you have to put stock in what the others say .   
No hard feelings , ” I said .   
I made myself smile as I stood from my seat .   
Countenance stood too .   
He shook my hand .   
“
I ’ll see you around , I hope we can work together then .
”
“ I hope so too .   
Good luck , ” Countenance said .
“
Let me get the door for you , ” Anelace said .   
He jumped to his feet and opened the door for me .   
His voice was quiet as he said .   
“
Sorry to see you go .
”
The thinkers would have noticed that .
I wondered what Effervescent and Relay would be reporting about my emotional state as I left .
⊙ “ Mrs. Dallon ?
”
I stood from my seat in the waiting room .
The cape had a costume that looked like a suit , metallic silver fabric , with a black dress shirt underneath .   
His mask consisted of two panels that met and ran down the center of his face , creating an almost beak - like profile with how the two sides swept along the sides of his face and back .   
Not bird - like , but as if his entire head was the beak .   
The hair I could make out above the ‘ v’ where the mask parted was longer and heavily styled .
It reminded me of the Ambassadors from Boston , but I was pretty sure they would n’t have worn suits as ostentatious as this , nor such a dramatic full - face mask .
“ You did n’t come in costume ?
” he asked .   
He sounded surprised .
“
I ’m pre - identity adjustment , ” I said , caught in trying to find my footing with my rehearsed explanation as I simultaneously crossed to where he was to shake his hand .   
“ Moving on from the identity and methodology I had as a teenage heroine .   
I ’m a blank slate , and there ’s a lot of room to adjust my brand moving forward .
”
“
Are you ex - Protectorate ?
” he asked .   
“
I might have missed that if it was in your application .
”
“
No .   
Ex - Ward , but only very briefly .
”
“
I only ask because you went straight to the term ‘ brand’ .   
I ’m used to hearing it from people who were in the PRT and people from other corporate teams .   
I know I read your file and there was no mention of a corporate background .   
I ’m Lark .   
You ’ll meet Dido soon , all going well .
”
“
It ’s nice to meet you , Lark .
”
“
My office is this way , if you ’ll join me , ” he said .   
He briefly touched the small of my back to guide me in the direction his other hand was indicating .
I was bothered by the contact .   
Unsolicited touching , the presumed closeness , and the fact it was a hot day
, my back was damp from the walk and he would have felt that .
It was such an unnecessary thing and it made both of us uncomfortable .
“ Brockton Bay , ” he said .
“
Yes .   
From birth to Endbringer and immediate aftermath .
”
“
A mom and pop small town team ?
”
“ Aunt and uncle and cousins too ,
” I said .   
“
Extended family .   
They passed the fifteen year mark with just donations and small events .   
I think that counts for something .
”
“
It ’s better than what Dido and I have managed , but give us time .   
We have five parahumans on the team , and we ’re already in the black when it comes to the business end of things .
”
“ I spent most of my childhood watching my mom balance the books , I did the events , the photoshoots , the merchandising as a PRT - acknowledged team .   
I have something of a sense of what you ’re probably going for .
”
“
Ah , the merchandising .   
I think I have your PRT trading card from that time period in a binder in my office .
” I smiled .   
“
Which one ?   
I had one that was holographic , which you could swipe through the controller for the video game to have me as a polygon - rendered helper , and the higher quality one that had the bio on the back .
”
“ I think it was the second one .   
My office is through this door .
”
I took a seat opposite the glass - top desk while he closed the door .   
He undid the button in his suit jacket before sitting down .
“
Typically those of us at Auzure like to work with new parahumans , ” he said .   
“
They ’re easier to brand .   
When we work with capes with a history , we like that history to be a strong one .
”
“ I think you get the best of both worlds with me , ” I said .   
“
Most people assumed I was dead when everything happened in Brockton Bay , and nobody corrected that misunderstanding .   
If you do dig up information about me , a lot of it is strong .
”
“ I think that ’s where we run into problems , ” he said .   
“
A lot of your history and presence is tied into your family ’s group identity .   
‘ Glory Girl’ is n’t famous beyond a certain range .   
Hometown heroine , yes , with some people in Boston and New York who might know of you , but not famous .
”
“ Then consider me new .   
Untainted by the past .
”
“ I would , but we use things we term perception turns , or just turns .
”
“ I know the term , ” I said .
“ I like that you do .   
Branding , turns .   
You do seem to know what you ’re getting into here .   
When we ’re tracking someone
’s marketability , we map out the turns .   
You ’re fine , nothing exceptional , for most of your career , with an upturn if you count your disappearance , after the Slaughterhouse Nine .
”
I took a deep breath , then nodded .
“
But if we include your family , there ’s a lot of baggage .
”
“
You could say that , ” I said .
“ Downturn , death of Fleur .   
Downturn , times when New Wave was subsisting , but not in the eyes of the media .
”
“
Four adolescents and two couples , there were weeks where school or work took priority .   
That got better as my cousins
and I got older .
”
“ Cousins … and your sister ?
” he asked .
I felt the shock like it was cold water .
He continued , “ I think if it were up to the turns and the background alone , it would have to be a no .   
At the time you should have been drawing the most attention , given your age and potential ,
you … died , as you put it .   
You were gone for the two years before Gold Morning .
”
“
Yes , ” I said .
“ We ’re offering cape services for the reconstruction , with Spell offering some massive assistance with the agriculture .   
It ’s a big part of what ’s driving us to the front pages , giving us some upturn in the most general sense , for public perception .   
What we really want is the human angle , something where we could have an attractive young lady like yourself in a photo op , or your sister- ”
“
No , ” I said .
“
Her and the right person in a photograph ?   
If you two paired up , Auzure could make you big .
”
I winced , and I stood from my seat .
“ Victoria ?
”
They had n’t accepted the interview to get me for me .   
I was just a stepping stone to the person they really wanted .
“
Thank you for your time , ” I said .
I managed to restrain myself from slamming the door on the way out .
⊙ “ Thanks for meeting us out here , ”
Whorl said .   
He did n’t shake my hand , but instead reached out to clasp my wrist .   
I clasped his .
“
Not a problem , ” I said .   
I looked up at the structure that had been erected around the portal .   
It cast a shadow .   
“
It ’s nice to be in the shade , with a decent breeze .
”
Whorl wore a blue mask with a white border around the eyes and outermost edge , and his costume was a ‘ preppy’ bodysuit , complete with a folded collar , like a polo shirt , a narrow belt , and leggings .   
His icon was large on his chest , a circle with angled spokes at the edges .   
He had an armband with the gold morning symbol on it , but the colors were the blue and white of his costume .
He grinned , showing off white teeth .   
“
You should have been here at noon .   
It was brutal .
”
“ The people were n’t too irritable , with the heat ?
”
All around us , people were coming through the portal , forming lines .   
There were buildings to the left and right of the street that people were heading into , to get the instructions and things necessary to start their lives in Gimel .
“ I think they were happy for it , ” Whorl said .
“ I ’ve been going back and forth , and it ’s miserable on the other side .
”
“ I just realized I got us started on a conversation about the weather , ” I said .
“
I ’m
kind of a weather manipulator , not really ,
but it ’s fun to say .   
Talking about the weather happens more than you ’d think , when it comes to me , ” he said .
Again , that smile with those very white teeth .
“ I read up on you online , ” I said .
“
Ah , did you ?   
Should I be flattered or worried that I ’ve been stalked ?
”
I was reminded of the segment on television , the reporter trying to corner Chevalier by getting him to claim a certain attitude .
“
It ’s not stalking , ” I said .   
“
I ’m doing my homework , is all .
”
I had to admit , the preppy look with the wide shoulders , narrow waist , clean cut and nicely taken care of ,
it appealed to me , and it had always .   
Not that I was even remotely thinking of actually moving forward with a relationship .
“
I ’m probably going to have to duck out and handle some minor crisis or another , but stick around and do n’t disappear on me , we ’ll find the time and figure out if we can place you with the Attendant .
”
“ That ’d be great .
”
“ If I get caught up in something , find one of the others .   
Chat with them , they ’ll tell you what they think of the team .
”
There were a few other capes distributed across the crowd .   
It was interesting how people seemed so keen on them , even approaching them , happy to see them .   
The sentiment of blame had n’t gripped the refugees here .
A teenager with a moon design on her mask and dress - like costume .
I saw a humanoid mech the size of a car , with a glass tank for the ‘ body’ , something large and fishlike within the tank .   
The mech sat on its ass , feet sticking out , and children were crowding around to tap the glass and climb on the feet .   
The tinker , as I took it , was the one sitting on the suit
’s shoulder .   
Another cape was standing on the end of a rod , three stories above the ground , the end of the rod stuck into the side of the building .   
He looked stern as he looked down at the scene , his arms folded , until someone waved up at him and he waved back .
“ Is that the whole team ?
”
“ Not even close .    
With the teams merging , we ’re taking on a lot of others .   
We ’ll be breaking up into three sub - teams later , but all with the same name and brand .
”
“
I do n’t know if I ’m hurting my chances saying this , but I ’m kind of crossing my fingers
you guys are going with the Shepherd ’s name and brand , but the Attendant ’s approach .
”
Whorl smiled again .   
“ We might be .
”
“ I like the approach , ” I said .
“
How do you interpret it ?
”
“ Giving people security .   
Moving slowly , with measured steps , informed by the lessons of the past .   
You guys seem pretty focused on taking and holding territories , improving neighborhoods .   
After what happened at the Norfair community center , I think giving people time to get used to capes again is key .
”
“ I think it might be , ” Whorl said .
Above , the cape that was standing on the end of the horizontal pole whistled .   
As we looked up , he pointed .
“
That ’s my cue , ” Whorl said .   
“
No pun intended .   
I ’ll be right back .
”
Whorl headed toward the building that the people were filing out of , moving at a light jog , with a fog - like nimbus building at his shoulders and arms .
I looked at the various capes , debating my options .   
I worried that flying up to say hello to the one at the end of the pole would spook him and make him fall from his roost , and I was n’t that keen on flying .
That left two options .   
The tinker or the teenage girl with the moon iconography .
I made my way toward the girl , because she had less people around her .   
The crowd was a bit of a tide I had to work against .
“
Stuck ?
”
I heard a voice .
I turned my head .   
It was a man with tattoos , a cleft chin and eyes that looked like he was perpetually squinting , even in the shade of the gate that housed the Bet - Gimel portal .   
He was talking to a couple .
“
It ’s a big decision .   
We ’re not farmers .
”
“
It ’s hard , getting started again , ” the guy with the tattoos said .   
“
The tent cities are rough , while you wait for an available apartment .   
You can work your ass off , earn fake ‘ dollars’ that might not have value in a few weeks or months , you sweat , you hurt , and everyone around you is doing the same .   
Stinks , when everyone ’s working that hard and getting only a few minutes to shower .
”
“
We ’ve heard of things like that .
”
“ If you want another option , we ’ve got a settlement at Canaan .   
Small city , even .   
Or a big town .   
We ’ve got extra rooms , food , and dangerously strong alcohol .   
We ’re still trying to figure that out .
”
I heard the rustle of papers .
“ Canaan ?
” I asked .
“
Yes .   
Have you been ?
”
“
I ’ve heard stories , ” I said .   
I turned to the couple , “
I ’m
ninety percent sure the Canaan area is Fallen territory .   
Outskirts of the megalopolis .
”
“ We ’re not really holding fast to all of that anymore , ” the guy with the tattoos said .   
“
We said the world would end , we tried to draw attention to it , the world ended , we were right .   
Now we make the best of things .
”
“
That seems like a pretty skewed take , ” I said .
He rolled his eyes as he looked away from me .   
He turned back to the couple .   
“
You have the directions .   
Easy to catch a bus to New Haven , catch another bus to the Hartford Stretch .   
Go to the address , we almost always have someone with a ride waiting there for the buses , to drive you into Canaan .   
The hard work has been done
, it ’s easier , it ’s more fun , and there ’s actual community .   
It ’s one of the things that ’s strangely missing from most parts in this city .   
You ’ll notice that .
”
“ Maybe , ” the guy from the couple said .   
“
I ’ll keep this .
”
“ McVeay , Crowley , or Mathers ?
” I asked .
The guy shot me an annoyed look .   
“
What ? ”
“
Which family branch were or are you ?
”   
I asked .   
I turned to the couple .   
“
Three branches , each loosely themed after one of the Endbringers .   
There was a nascent fourth in twenty - thirteen that was based on one or all of the other three , but I missed the memo on that .
”
“ Crowley , ” the guy said .   
“
We were the jackasses .
”
“ McVeays were the ultra - religious , more violent ones , loosely themed after Behemoth , ” I said .   
“
Mathers were the ones themed after the Simurgh .   
They ’re still around too , they did a lot of the kidnappings of kids and capes , with intent to force marriages .   
Then you have the Crowleys , who were a little bit more than jackasses .   
Stirring panic , scaring people , violence .
”
“ To draw attention to the imminent end of the world , ” the guy with the tattoos said .   
“
Do you want us to apologize for trying to get people ’s attention and failing ?   
Or should we not have tried ?   
We were right .
”
“ Is there a problem ?
”
A woman ’s voice .   
I thought it was the girl with the moons on her costume .   
It was n’t .   
Another woman with tattoos , with friends .   
One of the tattoos was of a bat - winged schlong .   
Another was of a cartoon character I did n’t recognize getting spit - roasted , in the metal pole , open fire sense .
She had others , but I could n’t see enough of them to tell what they were .   
I could guess they were similarly tasteful .   
Her top was tied at the sternum , exposing ribs and stomach .
“
Just a bit of one , ” I said .   
“
You guys are openly recruiting from this crowd here ?
”
“
Recruiting is an strange way to put it , ” the guy with the tattoos said .
I looked at the couple .   
“ If it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .   
Free rent , free food , drinks , company ?
”
“ Cheap rent , ” the woman with the tattoos said .   
“
A lot of people stay just long enough to make some extra money while commuting to Hartford and paying rent to us .
”
“
All we ask is that people who decide to go make sure to tell people that hey , we are n’t assholes , ” the tattooed guy said .
“
We are n’t assholes !
”
the burly guys who were keeping the woman company cheered in near - unison .
“
Which Crowley is in charge ?
” I asked .
“
Hey , bitch , ” the woman said .   
“ Just move on .   
Fuck off .
”
The cheering had drawn attention .   
The teenage girl with the moons on her costume approached , ducking beneath one of the burly guy ’s arms .   
She spotted me , saw that last exchange , and drew close to me , putting one hand on my shoulder .
“
You ’re the one
Whorl was talking to ?
” she asked .
“
Yeah .
”
“ Take it from me , it ’s not worth it .   
Come on .
”
The guy with the tattoos smirked .
“ You know they ’re recruiting here , right ?
”
I asked .
“ We know , ” she said .   
“ We ’ve drawn attention to it .   
We were told to keep out of it , so long as they behave .
”
She put pressure on my shoulder , urging me to move .   
I took one step back .
I did n’t want to let this go .   
I would have more regrets if I walked away .
“
Which Crowley ?
” I asked .   
“
There were three brothers and one sister , last I heard .
”
“ Does n’t matter , ” the tattooed guy said .
“
Eldest brother was a murderer , got ousted from the family for that , back in twenty - eleven , when the Fallen were still minor .   
But around the time their numbers swelled in twenty - twelve , early twenty - thirteen , he got accepted back , head of the Crowley branch .   
He killed two of his own family members after that .   
I think that matters a lot , since if he ’s in charge , you ca n’t really call yourselves mere jackasses .
”
“ Not him .
”
There were a few more faces appearing in the crowd .   
Unfriendly .
The girl with the moon design leaned in close , murmuring in my ear , “ They have someone with powers in the crowd .   
They send people out to fish for recruits , and if there ’s trouble , they have these reinforcements summoned into the middle of the crowd and they ’ll shout you down .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .   
“
Middle brother and the sister were pretty skeevy too .   
They did n’t kidnap anyone directly , but they networked with the other families , gave shelter to some McVeays who needed to duck the attention of the law , and they traded a few of their family members for some of the kidnapped minors and capes the Mathers family had .   
I ’d be concerned about going to that camp .
”
“
The little brother , ” the guy with the tattoos said .
“
The party animal , ” I said .
“
That ’s what we ’re about !
” were the shouts .   
There was more of a raucous response from the other reinforcements .   
Cries and shouts of ‘ party’ .   
People throughout the crowd were looking .
“
He ’ll try to steal your girlfriend before he makes you welcome !
”
I had to raise my voice to be heard .   
The people who were pushing forward made it harder for me to see the couple .   
“
It ’s not worth it .   
You can look him up at a library .   
Jake Crowley !   
Four wives , all half his age !
”
There were shouts and bellows of denial , a few swears directed my way .   
One ‘ cunt’ , from someone close enough to have punched me if he ’d felt the desire .
“ Throw away the paper , ” I called out .   
“
It ’s not worth it !
”
With the press of bodies , I did n’t see the paper get thrown away .   
But I saw the guy hugging his girlfriend closer , I saw the fractional nod .
That was all I got .   
The moon girl pushed me harder , and I allowed myself to be pushed this time .
I walked backward out of the crowd , looking at the group .   
They were still making a lot of noise .
Whorl was waiting for me as I made my exit from the thicker part of the crowd .   
The mech tinker was standing on the head of his suit , now , and the suit was standing too , which gave him a decent vantage point overlooking everything .
“
It ’s going to take an hour before they settle down , ” Whorl said .   
“
What was that about ?
”
“ Fallen recruiters , ” I said .
“ I know that much .
”
“ I wanted to make sure the people they were talking to knew , ” I said .   
“ Told them who the family was , how they operated , who the leader was .
”
“ You think they listened ?
”
Moon girl asked .
“ They might have , ” I said .   
“
I did n’t get the impression I was going to start a riot , so I thought I ’d be okay trying .
”
“ Nah , ”
Whorl said , “ Your impression was fine .   
No riot .   
They know to keep their hands to themselves , and just to be loud .   
They stick to the rules so they can keep coming back .   
We were told to let them , which sucks , but we have to work with the authorities .
”
“ I told her that , ” Moon girl said .   
“
That we were supposed to leave it be .
”
“
Before or after she stirred them up ?
”
“
Before , ” I answered for her .   
“
I knew , I went ahead anyway .
”
Whorl frowned .
“ I knew it would probably cost me my spot on the team , ” I said .
Whorl nodded slowly .
“
But if it stops one person from going over to that town of theirs … I guess it ’s worth it .
”
“
It might have worked , ” Whorl said , “ But they ’ve got the reinforcements , they ’ll double down .   
They ’ll try harder , make up for it .
”
“ You guys are all about learning from the mistakes of the past , ” I said .   
“ Paying respect to the casualties .   
You have to know they ca n’t be allowed to get a foothold .   
They ’re too monstrous , and the people they ’re going after are too vulnerable .
”
“ They have a foothold already , ” he said .   
“
We ’re the guys who failed to stop the end of the world , and they ’re the ones who were right about it .   
To some people that ’s all that matters .   
It does n’t matter that they ’re scumbags or that they ’re dangerous .   
Not everyone , but even one out of every thirty is a lot .
”
“ We should go calm things down , ” Moon girl said .
“
Yeah , ” Whorl said .   
“
Distract the people from the tattooed hooligans .
”
“
Good luck with that , ” I said .
“ Take care , Victoria .   
Keep fighting the good fight , whatever you end up doing .
”
I gave him a casual salute , two fingers of one hand touching my brow .
I braced myself , both in balance and emotionally , then took to the air , moving slowly .   
I raised myself up to the same level as the guy at the end of the pole , staying within his field of vision so I would n’t surprise him .
They were using the powers to teleport people in .   
I could n’t see where the fade - in happened or where the teleportation destination was , but as the crowd shuffled , there were more of the people with tattoos , trashy people , and people that did n’t look like refugees .
The guy on the end of the pole pointed .   
I moved closer to him , and followed the line of his arm and finger to see .
A man with a daughter , sitting on a blanket at the base of a fence .
“
The girl or the man ?
” I asked .
“
The man .   
He ’s the one bringing them in .   
Keeps the kid close as a shield , in case someone catches on .   
Different kids , some days .
” I nodded .
“ I think every day of going over there and taking him out of the picture .   
Letting him know I know .
”
“ Would n’t be worth it , ” I said .
The noises of the crowd of Fallen increased , a fresh chant .   
Heads were turning and people were smiling , because they did n’t know , and positivity and high energy meant a lot when they were as tired and despondent as they were .   
Some would have spent a long time waiting for their chance to come through .








There was something to be said about the fact that the hospital was still in construction while it was running .   
There were patients in the waiting room , sitting in the chairs that had been bolted to the floor , and the unhappiness of needing a hospital visit was compounded by the fact that a third of the way across the room , behind a plastic sheet that had been taped to walls , ceiling and floor , a team was using power tools and calling out in loud voices as they built the rest of the room .
The hospital staff looked pretty miserable too , most of them sequestered on the other side of a counter , walled off from the patients by a plexiglass window .   
Security guards stood off to one side .
“
Can I help you ?
” a secretary asked .
“
I was wondering if it was possible for me to see a patient ?
”
“ Visiting hours are open .   
Patient ’s name ?
”
“ Fume Hood .   
I do n’t know her real name .
”
The secretary stopped , then looked at the male secretary , who sat at the other end of the counter .   
She looked past him at the security guard .
Of course .
“
I was one of the people giving her medical attention when the ambulance arrived , ”
I said .   
I knew it would n’t matter , that they would assume I ’d been lying , but I hoped it would temper the reaction .
“
She ’s not accepting visitors , ” the secretary said .
“ One second , ” I heard .   
A female voice .
Two overlapping sections of the plastic sheet peeled apart .   
Tempera ducked through , and put the tacky sides of the plastic back together .   
She was dusty from plaster and streaked with paint that was n’t from her power .   
She wore overalls , a black t - shirt for a top , and had a different pattern to the paint she ’d applied over her eyes with fingers , more like she had applied it to her fingers and pressed them to her eyes as a series of vertical bars , each bleeding into the one beside it .
“
Hi , Victoria , ” she said to me .
“
Hi .
”
She looked at the secretary , “
We know her .   
Can I take her back to the room ?
”
“
Let me get her information , and I ’ll buzz you two through .
”
I took the clipboard with the paperwork , and I filled out the information , checking my phone to remind myself of the specifics of Crystal ’s address .   
She took the clipboard , read it over , and let us through .
We walked down the back halls of the hospital , past individual clinics and their signs and separate waiting areas , past patient rooms and nurse ’s stations .   
Tempera indicated the turns .   
We did n’t rush it , an unspoken agreement that we ’d take our time , have a chance to talk .
“
There was one attempt on her life .   
We were worried there would be another , ” Tempera said .
“
Are you standing guard ?
” I asked .
“
I am keeping an eye on things , but mostly by accident .   
I ’ve been helping with the construction .   
I like getting my hands dirty , ” Tempera said .   
She smiled as she held up one hand , which was covered in wet white ‘ paint’ down to the elbow , the paint turning black before transitioning to her light brown skin .   
“ Look at you , though .   
You look tidy .
”
Tidy .   
It was an amusing choice of words , when Tempera looked anything but .   
I smiled .   
“ Looking around to see if any teams are looking to fill positions .
”
“
And ?
”
“ Only one was actually posting any openings , a corporate team , Auzure .   
Foresight and the Attendant were open to interviewing me .   
There are two other big teams ; one gave me a hard no , and the other is folding into the Attendant and wo n’t exist soon , they did n’t give me a response yet , and with how the talk with the Attendant went , I do n’t think it ’d work out .
”
“
They ’re pretty conservative .   
In a lot of respects .   
A lot of the religious capes went to the Shepherds and will be part of the Attendant .   
I ’ve been paying close attention to that .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“ One or two of the sketchy people from Empire Eighty - Eight , too .
”
“ Empire Eighty - Eight ?   
They sound familiar .
”
“ They had a presence for a while .   
A few years back they broke up into two other groups .   
The Pure and Fenrir ’s Chosen .
”
“
Ah .   
I know the Chosen .   
They were linked to the Clans , I think ?
”
“
Yes .   
The Clans spread out across multiple cities , and would funnel anyone who got powers over to the Empire Eighty - Eight core group , back before Leviathan broke the group
’s back .   
They were a background element in my childhood and cape career .
”
“ Ahh .   
Was that a factor in your wanting to join ?
”
A very carefully neutral question , that .   
I wondered if she was prodding me , not declaring a stance while feeling me out .   
I was still an unknown , in a way .
“
Violent racists on the team ?   
Definitely a factor , big point against .   
Question is , are they ex - violent , ex - racists ?   
Gets muddier .   
Even then , I might draw the line there , and not join .   
If they were contrite ?   
I could roll with that , I think .   
Barring one or two especially scummy individuals .   
Interview did n’t get far enough for me to raise the subject .
”
Tempera nodded , not saying anything .
“
I think … maybe I ’m being unsubtle , saying it , but I think there ’s a big difference between who those guys were and who Fume Hood is .
”
“ I think so too .
”
“
How is she ?
”
“
She ’s hurt by what happened .   
It ’s hard , to put yourself out there , face your shortcomings , try to be better , and get shot for it .
”
“ Partial facing of shortcomings , from what she and I talked about , ” I said .
“
It ’s why I said face , instead of ‘ admit’ , ” Tempera said .   
“
But I do n’t want to quibble .   
Change of subject .   
You said your meeting went badly .   
Can I ask what happened ?
”
“ Fallen , ” I said .
“
Did you get in another fight ?
”
“
No , ” I said .   
I sighed .   
“
No .   
They did what they often do , they caused a disruption , and that ’s a playing field that suits them well .   
I ’d call it a draw , but I ’m pretty sure they ’re still out there
recruiting
and I ’m not out there counteracting that .
”
“
There will always be bad guys .   
They will always be out there .   
There will always be murders , there will be theft , there will be drugs .
” I nodded .
“ Question is , ” Tempera said , “ Where do you want to be , in relation to that , as it happens ?
”
“
That is a deceptively tricky question , ” I said .
“ You definitely put yourself out there , backing us up when things went sideways at the community center .
”
“
I really appreciate that you see it that way , ” I said .
“
You put yourself in front of Lord of Loss .   
I do n’t know how your power works , but it ’s obvious you can bleed .   
There was some danger there .
”
I acknowledged that with a small nod .
“
And now you ’re interviewing for teams ?   
So soon after ?   
It sounds like you want to be out there , helping .
”
“ I do .   
I ’m zero for three , though .
”
“ You do n’t want to be independent ?   
Hold on a second .   
We ’re nearly at the room , but let ’s finish talking before we go in .
”
We stopped midway down the hallway .   
A nurse ’s station was a short distance away .
“ I- ” I started .   
“ I think , the way things are going , I might end up going that way .   
Teams are a complication of their own .
”
“ They are , ” Tempera said .   
“
I had a phone call earlier , offering a position .   
I can go right there and sign the paperwork if I want to .
”
“ With ? ”
“
The Attendant , as it happens , ” Tempera said .
I was momentarily lost for words .   
She ’d been doing what I ’d thought , inviting me to answer without declaring a position , but from a different angle .
“
I want to wait and see how the merger with the Shepherds shakes up , how it feels after , they said not to wait too long .   
It ’s decent money , decent exposure .   
A lot of decency .
”
“
Do n’t let what I said change your mind on anything .   
I ’m griping ,
it’s- ”
“
It ’s fine , ” she said .   
“
I invited you to gripe , if we ’re going to use your word .   
It ’s interesting to hear that take on them .   
I did n’t know about the racist ex - villains joining .   
I ’m curious about how they handled the Fallen there , too , in your situation .
”
“ I think , uh , do n’t tell them
I said this …
”
“
Of course .
”
“ … I think they or the people they ’re taking guidance from are approaching that stance of there always being bad guys to deal with , and they ’re deciding to conserve their energy .   
To not fight that fight .   
Maybe it ’s right to . ”
“ You got a draw .   
That ’s better than a win for the bad guys there .
”
“
It’s- yeah , ”
I said .   
“
I tried to use reason , draw on the stuff I studied , old knowledge I had about the group .   
Who they were , how they operate , the families , the names .   
Put that information out there , so the potential recruits would know the key facts .   
I tried to get them to say who their leader was , pressed the issue , and of course it was the least bad one , so the argument I was gunning for did n’t have much clout , and I lost steam .
”
“ I picture the Fallen as a group that ’s pretty comfortable defying reason .
”
“
Them , yes .   
The recruits , I think they were open to hearing it .   
I threw out some more information I remembered at the last second , but the Fallen were getting pretty loud , I did n’t want to start a riot , and that was more or less it .
”
“ And the Attendant ?
”
“ Were n’t keen on me making a point of things when the word from on high was to let the Fallen be .   
I did n’t get my invite to the team .
”
Tempera made a face .
“ I do n’t like ignoring the monsters .   
And I do think the Fallen are monstrous , as a collective force .
”
“
They ’re a headache
I was always glad I would n’t have to deal with , ” Tempera said .   
She scratched her nose as she scrunched it up , the paint there highlighting the creases .   
The scratching deposited more paint on the bridge .   
“ One
I guess I ’ll have to prepare myself for dealing with .   
Or possibly not dealing with , if I take the Attendant ’s offer .
”
“ Possibly , ” I said .   
“
Do n’t give my words too much weight .
”
“ I ’ll try to be sensible about it .   
I might end up asking those questions you did n’t get a chance to , if that ’s okay .
” I nodded .
“ I think I ’ll be okay , whatever happens .   
The Wardens facilitated Attendant ’s contact with me , and from their tone , I think they ’d push to get me on another team if I did n’t go with that one .
”
“
That ’s great , ” I said .
“ I could put in a word for you .
”
“
I would n’t say no ,
” I said .   
“
I do n’t think I ’ll get my hopes up , either .
” Tempera frowned .
“
Sorry .   
I did n’t mean to sound negative .
”
“
Are you finding your way , with these setbacks ?
” I shrugged .   
“
Complicated .   
Just wanted to check in on Fume Hood , while things are quiet .   
When the law or the system fail to outline a process , do what seems right .   
When it ’s not clear what ’s right , go with the law .   
When neither is clear , reach out .
”
“
For perspective ?
” I shrugged .   
“
That too .   
More eyes on a problem never hurts .
”
“
Another point for the team , instead of going independent , ” Tempera said .   
She looked back down the hall , in the direction we ’d been walking to .   
“
Hold on a moment ?   
I ’ll check if she ’s decent .   
I would n’t mind bringing Fume Hood into it , now that we ’re past the semi - confidential stuff about other teams .
” I nodded .
She touched the wall by the door as she rounded the corner , stepping into the room , and she knocked on the door as she entered .
There was a brief pause .   
The handprint of paint on the wall dropped to the floor with a splat as Tempera said , “ Come in .
”
The blob of paint on the door fell to the ground as well .   
Both moved along the ground as I entered , spattering against the back of Tempera ’s shoes and the back of her overalls .
Fume Hood had donned a mask , but she did n’t wear the hood .   
She lay down on the bed , which was angled so she could sit up at an angle .   
A blanket had been pulled up to her waist , covering her legs .
Crystalclear sat in the chair between her and the window , the crystal configuration on his head slightly different than before .   
He wore a t - shirt and shorts .   
There was something odd about a guy with crystals where his eyes and hair would be having very ordinary hairy legs .
“
Heya , ” Crystalclear said .
“
Hi , ” I said .
“
Hey , patrol girl with a name
I ca n’t remember , ” Fume Hood said .
“ Victoria , ” Tempera volunteered .
“ Victoria .   
Right .   
Thank you for helping to hold my blood in , ” Fume Hood said .
“
You ’re very welcome , ” I said .   
I noted the flowers and cards sitting beneath the window .   
“
Sorry I did n’t bring anything .   
This is my awkward ‘ I was in the neighborhood’ visit .   
I saw the hospital name and remembered you were brought out this way .
”
“ I ’ve got too much as it is .   
Turns out that the key to popularity and acceptance is to get yourself shot .
”
Her tone was light , almost amused .   
Tempera had said Fume Hood was hurt on an emotional level , but I did n’t see a sign of it .   
I could remember how Tempera had acted on my first meeting with her , how in tune with her team she had been .   
I was willing to put a lot of stock in her take on things .
“ Victoria , what I was going to say , before deciding I ’d rather say it here , was that we ’re going our separate ways , yes-
” “ Longscratch is already gone , ” Crystalclear said .   
“
But I do n’t think he was ever going to stick around on a permanent basis .
”
“
Yes , ” Tempera said .   
“
Which is a shame .   
I do hope he finds what he ’s looking for .   
My point is , I do n’t want to lose touch .   
It ’s helpful and nice that Crystalclear happened to be here to help illustrate that maintenance of contact .
”
“ Happy to take credit , ” Crystalclear said .
“
Victoria said- if you do n’t mind me repeating ?
”
“
No . ” “
She said that it ’s important to reach out , if I ’m recalling that right .   
I ’d like to stay friends with you , ” Tempera said .   
“ Crystalclear , Fume Hood .   
Victoria , you too .
”
“
Why ?
”
Fume Hood asked .
“
What do you mean ?
” Tempera asked .
“
We ’re very different people , ” Fume Hood said .   
“
I do n’t get how that works .   
How do you stay in touch with people you have very little in common with ?
”
“ Easy .   
Grab a bite sometime , ” I said .   
“ Sandwich , beer or soda , share stories , get different perspectives .   
I would n’t mind .
”
“
That ’d be nice , ” Crystalclear said .
“
But-
” Fume Hood started .   
She frowned .   
“
Okay , whatever .
”
“
You should find the words for what you ’re trying to say , ” I said .   
“
In case it festers or gets in the way .
”
“ I dunno .   
I do n’t get why you ’re here .   
I ’m grateful , do n’t get me wrong .   
You put pressure on my wound , Tempera gave me first aid and used her paint to keep me from dying .   
I probably owe you my lives .   
But that whole fiasco was my fault .
”
“ I blame the attacking villains , not you , ” Tempera said .
“
Yep , ” Crystalclear said .
“ Are you trying to be clever and get me to keep being a hero , then ?
”
Fume Hood asked .
“
I ’m here because I was interested in how you were doing ,
” I said .   
“
Obviously I ’d prefer it if you stayed a hero , but that ’s not the objective .
”
“ If you guys keep showing up with flowers or to make small talk , you make it awfully hard for me to fuck off and go back to being a villain .
”
“
That ’s a plus , ” Tempera said .   
“
But like Victoria said , it ’s not the main point .
”
“
On the topic of pluses , ” I said , “ I ’m interested in who those guys were .   
So if you hear anything , I would n’t mind a heads up .
”
“
The guy who shot me did so of sound mind , no Kingdom Come in play .   
Independent , apparently .   
No money in his accounts , he did n’t have internet .   
He was just pissed off .
”
“
There were the villains , too , ” I said .
“ There were .
”
“
And we do n’t know what they were after , ” Crystalclear said .
“
Multiple conflicting stories , ” I said .   
“ Blindside lied to me when I asked .   
It bothers me , and I worry it ’ll happen again .
”
“ Give me your cell phone number , ” Tempera said .   
“ I ’ll get in touch .
”
There was a brief pause while we sorted things out , me getting the contact information from each of the others , and giving them mine .   
They already knew each other .
Reaching out , making and maintaining contact .
A part of me had hoped that Fume Hood was wrong , that the team would n’t have dissolved , that they ’d be together , willing to give things another try .   
That it might have been a team I could join .
“ The cards and flowers might have something to do with how you ’re the topic of the moment , ”
I mused aloud .
“
I heard something about that , ” Fume Hood said , indicating Crystalclear .
“ From me , ” Crystalclear volunteered unnecessarily .
“ If you guys were to try again , there could be more attention , more support , ” I said .
“
More gunshots ?
”
Fume Hood asked .   
“
I ’m stepping down and going into hiding .   
I ’ll recuperate , let the heat die down , and then figure out what I ’m doing .
”
“ If it matters , I think more people are siding with you than not , ” I said .
Fume Hood nodded a few times , taking that in .   
“
Weird .
”
“
It ’s good , ” Tempera said .   
“
I think Crystalclear already accepted the offer from Foresight , though .
”
“
It was a very promising offer .
”
“
And I ’ve been contacted by Attendant .   
I do n’t know what I ’ll do with that .   
And Victoria-
”
“ Is not having much luck , ” I said .   
“
But I want to do something .
”
“ You were thinking you might go independent ?
”
“
Which does n’t pay , ” I said .   
“ Not in this environment .
”
“ How does that work ?
”
Fume Hood asked .   
“
If you ’re a crook , it ’s easy , you take jobs at the villain bar , or you rob some place , or any number of things .   
You just … go out on patrol ?
”
“
There are a few other things to do , ” I said .   
“ One way is to essentially run a protection racket that is n’t a racket .   
It ’s easy for that to go wrong .   
There ’s a higher level effect , which is easier to pull off when , say , a city has a downtown area and the shop owners gather together to pay a wage to the hero that draws attention and has a positive influence on their area …
”
“ Things have to be stable before that happens , ” Tempera said .
“
We ’re not there yet , ” I said .   
“
There ’s training and support .   
Offering powers for helping with the rebuilding , which Auzure was doing a bit of .   
There ’s merchandising , but that ’s a dead market right now , I think .
”
“
We fished in that pond prior to getting underway and we did n’t get any bites , ” Crystalclear said .
“
I was selling my brain , I know a lot about capes and the community , having grown up with it .   
That job ’s done , and I do n’t know if there ’s much more opportunity for that .
”
“
Tell you what , ” Tempera said .   
“ I ’ll put out feelers .   
See what people say .
” I nodded .   
“
Sure .   
Thank you .
”
⊙ I was lost in thought enough that my retracing of my steps on the way out of the hospital turned me in circles .   
I approached the same nurse ’s station for a second time , and I stopped at the desk , waiting for someone with a spare moment to give me directions .
I wanted to do something .
There were n’t any openings .   
I was pretty sure
Advance Guard had turned me down because of my background , the two year gap prior to Gold Morning .   
Others had their reasons for rejecting me .   
As it was , the field was fairly cluttered .   
Villains were keeping their heads down .   
As much as there was always going to be the bad guys , like Tempera had said , we did n’t have the systems in place to identify them or address them .
No way to make money off of my powers , to pay the rent and get out of Crystal ’s borderline uncomfortably cluttered place .
“
Yes ?
” a nurse asked .
I blinked .   
I did n’t ask her for directions .   
My thoughts went in another direction , spurred to life by my thoughts of the unpaid cape work .
“
If I said ‘ crisis points’ , would that mean anything to you ?
” I asked .
“
It ’s been a long time since I heard that .   
Yes , it means something .   
Do you work with capes ?
”
“
I … kind of am a cape .   
Would you be open to me giving you a hand ?
”
“
Let me look into it .   
I ’m not sure what the usual methods are , and it ’s not fresh in my mind .
”
“ You ’d want to identify the key patients , check with any parents , if they ’re under eighteen , and they often are .   
Then with me , you ’d want to check with legal , you can call my references , which I do have on hand …
” ⊙ The mask was n’t the quality sort I was used to , more of a Halloween costume .   
The top I wore was
a men ’s small , a little too big in the shoulder , while it simultaneously squashed my chest .
From the ages of the patients in the pediatric wing , I was n’t sure they would pay much mind to my chest , squashed or not .   
Most were twelve or younger .   
A few heads turned , people paying cursory attention .
I still wore the skirt I ’d worn to the interviews , the belt .
Room 5 , bed C.
I entered room five .   
There were four beds , one in each corner .   
One monitor was beeping , the other kids were lying down , looking bored .
Bed C was a little girl , with a face chock full of freckles , and sandy blonde hair .   
The curtains had been partially closed , blocking the views of the boy sitting to her left and the girl sitting across from her .
“
Audrey ?
” I asked , peering in .
I saw only a glimpse of misery on her expression , while she stared off out the window .   
Then she raised her head and the expression was gone .   
She assessed me , head to toe .
“
Great , ” she said , after she was done .
“
Great ?
”
“
Ooh , yay , it ’s Legend , except he ’s a girl now
, ” she said , sarcastic .
The t - shirt I wore was styled after Legend ’s costume .   
The mask was the same .   
Something the staff had kept on hand from the past Halloween .
“
The nurses pointed me your way , ” I said .
“
Well , my day sucked , but now fake Lady Legend is here , so
I ’m all better .   
That ’s great .
”
“ I can take the mask off if you want , ” I said .
“
Oh , no , you ca n’t do that , fake Lady Legend .   
Your secret identity might be compromised !
”
The sarcasm ran strong through this one .
I pulled the curtain closed a bit more , then pulled off the mask , flying a bit as I said , “ I never really had the secret identity .
”
With that , at least , her eyebrows went up .   
No smart retort .   
She moved around her hospital bed , craning her head to see my feet , trying to spot the trick .
“
I do n’t know you , ” she said .
“ Does n’t matter , ” I said .   
“
The nurses mentioned you ’d had an especially bad day .
”
Again , that momentary look of misery .
Yeah , I knew that .
“
Back before everything turned sour , when I ’d come to the hospital , with , um-
” I stopped , drew in a breath , and sighed .   
“
It ’s something heroes would do .   
Check in on people who had really bad days .   
And when I came to the hospital , sometimes I ’d do that .
”
Crisis points .   
More a PRT thing than a New Wave thing , but we ’d done a small share .   
Looking out for the recent triggers , putting our faces and names out there , staying in touch with the public .
“
A nurse sat down with me for a while , ” she said .   
“
No offense , I appreciate it , but
I ’m kind of talked out .
”
“ Instead of talking , um , ” I said .   
I showed her what was in my hand , letting the straps dangle .   
“
What would you say about going flying ?
”
I saw her eyes go wide .
“
The hospital called your dad ’s work .   
He said it was okay .
”
⊙ My feet left the hospital rooftop .   
Flying was unwieldy , especially with my burden .   
I was untrained .   
Having the benefit of my forcefield to protect me in the event of a crash would mean having my forcefield up , and that had other connotations , with my power as distorted as it was , the fact that I could n’t necessarily control the movements or know what they would do .   
Not doable , when I held someone .
There was uncertainty too .   
The source of that flight , it had never let me down , but if push came to shove , in a crisis , would my maneuvering be sloppier ?   
Would I decelerate or accelerate in a different way ?   
I ’d carelessly trusted my power , once , and now I was n’t sure I could .   
I knew what the source of that power was , now , and what its goals were .
It was emotionally heavy , even as I felt almost weightless physically , to be reminded of what had changed so dramatically .
I could feel my charge ’s intake of breath , as I held one arm across her lower ribs .   
I did n’t trust the harness we ’d grabbed from the physio center .   
Not enough to hold someone for me .   
She was strapped with her back to my front .
The ground was a good ways below us now .   
I had n’t even ascended that fast .   
I ’d been a little lost in thought .
I felt her laugh , nervous and small , while I turned us around , giving her a view of the area .   
Norfair and its community center was off in the distance , one way .   
The farms were off in another direction .   
From here , it was easy to see the tall buildings of the city , the places that looked like a slice of the old world .   
To look to the fringes of those areas , where the tents and shoddily erected structures stretched off , so endless
it seemed they reached to the horizon .
“ I got you , ”
I said , in answer to the nervous giggles .   
Had I laughed like that , on my first real flight ?
“
Yeah , ” was the response , a small , quiet voice .   
Then more giggles .
The giggle became laughter on her part , borderline hysterical .
“
You okay ?
”
She nodded , fast and fierce , then drew in a deep breath .
“ Wooooooooo !
”
she whooped , top of her lungs , loud enough to be heard on the ground .
“
Hood up , ” I said , reaching up to tug the hood of her hoodie over her head .
“
What ?   
Why ?
” she asked , panting from the cheer .
“ Just in case it ’s cold , ” I said .
“ Cold ?   
Why-
”
Before she could fully catch her breath , I dropped from our position , diving , fast , hard , and surprising enough that even I felt my stomach ’s contents lurch .
She did n’t have the ability to cheer , as the drop stole what little breath she had , but her arms went up and out , to either side of my shoulders , fingers spreading to feel the wind , the sun - warmed air .
I smiled , letting the swoop dash all of the other thoughts and feelings from my mind , vicariously enjoying the experience of flying for the first time .   
Of flying at all .
⊙ “ Juan ?
” I asked .
Juan was younger than the other kids had been .   
Eight , if I had to guess , but he was n’t well , so that might have screwed up my estimation .   
He was thin at the arm and wrist , and puffy around the face .
“
The first time I came to the hospital , one of the nurses wore that costume , ” Juan said .   
“
He was a guy though .
”
“
How does it look on me ?
” I asked .
“
I think it looks really nice , ” he said .   
“
You ’re very pretty .
”
“
Thank you , ” I said .   
“
That ’s sweet .
”
“
Some of the others were saying a lady superhero was going around taking people flying .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
That ’s the plan .   
Your mom and dad said you might enjoy it , and you should be well enough .
”
“ They had to go to work , ” Juan said .
“
That ’s what I heard .
”
“ They always have to go .   
Even when I have bad days .   
And there ’s nothing on television .   
There ’s only three channels and they ’re real boring .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“ I really hate hospitals , ” he said .
I took a deep breath .   
His words echoed my feelings , which only magnified the feelings .
Yeah .   
I really hated hospitals too .
“
It ’s getting dark , ” I said ,
“
But if you want to try flying , maybe that ’d be a bit of a break from the boring stuff , and a break from the hospital .
”
“
Thank you , ” Juan said .   
“ But
flying sounds like it ’s very tiring .
”
“
It can be , ” I said .   
“
I can go slow if you like , or we can do something else .   
We could talk .
”
He nodded at that last bit , then started looking around .   
I pulled up a nearby chair , and sat down next to his bed .
“ I got a lot of books , ” Juan said .   
He deposited a stack of kids’ books and comics on the edge of the bed , between me and him .   
“ Uh , before .   
I said I did n’t want to be stuck here and be bored ,
my mom went and came back with books and comics , and then they both left .
”
“
That was nice of them , ” I said .   
I picked up one of the books .
“ My eyes are tired today , ” he said .   
“
The letters are blurry .
”
“
Do you want me to read some out loud ?
”
I asked .
That got me a firm nod , and the first smile I ’d seen out of him .
“
Good Simon to start , then ?
” I asked .   
Another nod .
There were pictures , so he shuffled over to the edge of the bed , and I sat on the other side , my ass half on the bed
’s railing , and I held the book between us
, so we could both see it .
Two good Simon books , which were most likely aimed at someone just a bit younger than Juan was , but he did n’t seem to complain .   
I moved on to a comic involving the robot prison ship , peeking ahead so I could skip past the scenes which were aimed at someone much older than him , and then , to be safe , moved on to something aimed at a younger age again .   
Kids in animal masks getting into trouble .
There was n’t much likelihood that Juan had powers , but he ’d had a bad day , and this was okay .
I was halfway through that book when I saw someone look in at the door , peeking around .   
A boy .   
He stopped as he spotted me .
I finished the page , then paused , partially closing the book , and checking on Juan .   
Fast asleep .   
I checked his pulse , because I was paranoid , then fixed his blankets , and eased myself up off the bed with flight , to not disturb him .
I used a notepad by the side of the bed , and wrote a brief farewell :
Nice to meet you , Juan .   
The nurses have my number so if you want to go flying sometime , we might be able to arrange something .    🙂 

-Victoria
I walked over to the door .   
It was n’t one of the ones I ’d taken a flight with .   
Older , thirteen or so , with what might have been his first pimples .
I saw the hesitation on his face .
“
Come on , ” I said .   
“
Let ’s go to the cafeteria .   
It ’s late , I do n’t think many people will be around .
”
He nodded .
⊙ “ Hello ?
”
“ Tempera ?   
Hi , it ’s Victoria .   
I ’m sorry to call you so late .
”
“
It ’s fine .   
I do n’t sleep much , and the call is more than welcome .   
Why the call ?
”
“
I ’m at the hospital , talking to someone- ”
“
You ’re still at the hospital ?
”
“
Yes .   
I ’ve been talking to a teenager
, he ’s listening in on my half of the conversation right now .   
He ’s got a friend with powers , but she ’s not doing so hot .   
It ’s new and
it ’s scary and
neither he nor she know what to do .
”
“ We ’ve been there .
”
“ We ’ve been there .   
Yeah .   
I know you ’re in touch with the Wardens .   
They ’re decent , they have a lot of resources , they have some good people .
”
“
Absolutely .
”
“
He can describe particulars and you can let them know .
”
“ Not a problem .   
Just so you know , it might be hard to get someone on the phone this late , but if it ’s a problem , I know some people I can round up
and we can go talk to her as a big supportive group .
”
“
Great .   
I ’m going to hand you off now .
”
“
Wait , one second .   
Victoria .
”
“
Yes ?
”
“
Call me back when this is over , or call me first thing in the morning .   
I was sounding out some people , it ’s not an invite to a team or anything , but with something this messy , we need all the hands we can get .
”
“ Messy ?
”
“ I ’ll explain later .   
For now , we help your buddy there .
”
I handed the corded phone over .   
We stood at an empty nurse ’s station in a hallway where the lights had been set dim .   
My hands were free , and I ’d intentionally used their phone so my own would be free .
There were other calls I needed to make , including one to Crystal to let her know where I was .   
I put that one off .   
Crystal was easygoing .
I sent one to Mrs. Yamada .
Me : 

I know your caseload is full , but found a kid with some power - related troubles .   
Contact is reaching out to Wardens soon .   
Maybe you can keep an eye out to make sure all goes smooth ?
The boy was explaining in a hushed voice about his friend ’s circumstance .   
An uncontrolled , messy power , and she had no place to go .   
He had n’t given me many details , but I could tell he was scared , and I could infer from that that she must be terrified .
The reply came back .
Jessica : 

Absolutely .   
I ca n’t promise I take them as a patient
but I can help with initial moves . 
 
I nodded to myself .
The boy was relaxing as he talked on the phone .   
A distant , authoritative , kind voice , and the promise of some answers or help .
My phone buzzed again .








It was dark as the boy
and I stepped outside .   
It was a flipping of perspectives , in a way , that the city lights were going out and the tent villages off in the distance were lighting up with lamps and fires .   
The city had only a small fraction of the light it might have had in the old world when power rationing was n’t in effect , only a tenth the normal number of apartments were lit up .   
Only the major roads had light , and that meant far less people were driving , which meant less head and tail lights .
It was cool out , not as cold as it had been last night , thankfully .
It was five minutes before Tempera met us at the door .   
She looked a little worn out , but then again , she ’d gone to the hospital , gone home , come back to the hospital , and she was juggling something with the messy situation she ’d talked to me about .
“
Hi Victoria .   
Hi Sam .
”
“ Hi , ” Sam said .
“
On a scale of one to ten , how serious is your friend ’s situation ?
”
“ Uh .   
Six ?   
She ’s depressed
, she ’s scared , she does n’t know how to use her power , and I ca n’t get near her to help her .   
She ’s afraid people are going to take her away .
”
“ How immediate is the situation ?   
Does she need help in the next five minutes , next hour , today ?   
Is she or anyone else in danger ?
”
“
She ’s alive , but I ’d like to get her help soon .   
She ’s freaking out
and I do n’t know what to do .
”
“
I ’m only asking like this because it ’s an emergency , and since our talk on the phone it ’s escalating .   
I ’m going to take you to the Wardens headquarters ,
okay ?   
I ’m going that way already , I can walk you through the security and introduce you to some people , and they ’ll have ideas on what to do with your friend .   
Sound good ?
”
“
Sounds alright .
”
“
What ’s the emergency ?
” I asked .
“ Citizen labor is going nuts .   
They ’re massing , pulling in some outside help , a lot of other angry and frustrated citizens .   
I do n’t have the full picture yet , but it ’s all hands on deck .   
Wardens are coordinating Advance Guard , Foresight , Shepherds , the Attendant and others .   
They ’re even bringing in the PRTCJ capes , which have n’t exactly been advertised to the public .
”
Crystal ’s group .   
The situation was bad enough to open the can of worms that was capes serving as a military - adjunct force ?   
In this climate , no less .
Tempera went on , “ I and some of the other prospective Wardens are being asked to go with the Wardens proper , to handle things where they ’re getting out of control offworld .
”
“ Offworld ?
”
“
I recommended you , said you ’d help , they ’ve given a tentative a - ok on that .   
Things are expected to blow up when the city wakes up tomorrow , so it ’s up to you if you want to help tonight or first thing tomorrow .   
I sent you the address ?
”
“ I got it , ” I said .
“ I should go .   
Sam , with me .
”
“
Good luck , ” I said .   
“
Sorry to pass the ball like this .
”
“
It ’s fine .   
Good luck to you too , Victoria .
”
I checked my phone , waiting painful minutes for sites to load .
She ’d said I could help tonight or tomorrow .   
That things would get bad starting tomorrow .
The news sites already had multiple headlines with the word ‘ war’ followed by a question mark .   
And things were expected to get worse tomorrow ?
No , I ’d go tonight .
I ’d fly , even .   
I messaged Crystal .   
⊙ I let myself into Crystal ’s apartment through the balcony , using the key Crystal had given me on the sliding glass door .
“
I ’m here ,
” I called out .
I was about to step from the living room to the hallway when a red - tinted forcefield appeared across the path , blocking my way .
“
One moment !
”
Crystal called out .
I turned my back to the forcefield and leaned against it , my arms folded .   
“
Can I talk to you from here ?
”
“ Yep ! ”
“
The headlines are saying war , ” I said .   
“
And you ’re being brought in .
”
“ Could go that way , ” Crystal said .   
“
It ’s wonky .   
Two sides are butting heads and we ’ve got another world that ’s pretty upset .
”
“ I ’ve only heard bits and pieces from some others and the news .   
Is it a strike ?
”
“ Not a strike .   
I ’m dressed now , you can come through , ” Crystal said .   
The forcefield disappeared , and I used flight to keep from falling , turning myself around before walking down the hallway and around the bend to Crystal ’s room .
Crystal had already been in costume and with her group when she ’d been ordered to get ready and be at the location within half an hour .   
She was using the opportunity to help get me organized .   
She ’d showered while waiting for me , she ’d donned her costume , and she was combing wet hair now .
Her costume was white , with her usual symbol on it , the arrow pointing down and to the side , with a stream of lines flowing from the back of the arrow , over one shoulder .   
She wore a jacket with it , a near - black gray , given a faint magenta - red tint .   
‘ PRTCJ’ was printed on the back in big white letters .   
A lone stylized chevron was on the sleeve .
There were things to be said about it , about the militaristic tilt of the group , the way the PRT and the Protectorate had broken in such a way that the Wardens had sprung up from one large chunk of the image , presentation and ideals .   
Crystal ’s parahuman miltary thing was crudely forged from another chunk of what the PRT had been : the PRT ’s old laws , rules , and discipline .   
A military - esque force without a government to serve or a hard and fast system of law to back it up .
But it was Crystal ’s call .   
Crystal ’s thing .   
I held my tongue .
“
My closet , ” she said .   
“ Black trash bags .   
Never throwing things away pays off .   
It ’s one of the sample batches .
”
The bags made the clothes easy to find , even in the jam - packed closet .   
The contents were hidden within the trash bags , the hooks of the hangers poking up and through .   
Crystal indicated the bed , and I laid them out , peeling the plastic back .   
White costumes without icons or decoration , a variety of cuts and styles .
It was a familiar range .   
Back in the day , companies had periodically reached out to New Wave , wanting to pitch their product and get us to use them for our costuming .   
Mom had handled those talks and periodically singled out a family member to send a bunch of proto - costumes to .   
Later she would nag us for feedback that she could send the companies .
I did n’t want to think about mom .
I focused on the costumes , with some attention paid to the situation at hand .   
The leotard cut was a ‘ never ever’ .   
The full - body suit was problematic because of how it resembled Scion ’s , and I did n’t want to go there .   
Those were two I could eliminate right away .   
I pulled the black trash bags down over them and set them aside .
Crystal explained , “ People have been noting how fast we got back on our feet , and how we have something reasonably stable in currency and economy .   
We kind of got our answer .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said , before guessing , “ powers ?
”
“ I guess powers , probably , ” she said .
I turned to look at Crystal .   
She was arranging her damp hair over her eye , a curved swoop that her hairband held in place .   
“ Only probably ?
”
“
This is n’t about powers , ” she said .   
“
But I would n’t rule them out .   
They helped and they may be part of this .   
The key thing is that a lot of the building materials and resources we used to get started came from other worlds .
”
“
As in our people working in other worlds or-
”
I paused as Crystal shook her head .   
“ Or other , alternate civilizations .   
Shit .   
You do n’t get anything of that scale for free .   
What did we have to give them in exchange ?
”
“
I have no idea , ” Crystal said .   
“
I do n’t think many people do .   
There are two major groups heading the reconstruction that might have an idea but they have n’t shared .   
One of those groups was the one who put out the trading dollar a few months after Gold Morning , now our de - facto regular dollar .   
Same group that ’s now looking at moving up into the greater political arena .
”
“
And those two groups are the ones butting heads ?
” I asked .
“
No , the two construction groups are banding together , kind of .   
The workers who have been doing the actual construction work seem to think they were promised a significant discount and first opportunity to buy the houses they ’ve been building .   
They ’ve been living in a tent village , working long weeks , miserable conditions .
”
“
And if they think they have dibs on the houses , the work must have been a labor of love .   
They ’ll have a strong community too .   
If they did n’t kill each other working that hard in conditions that bad , they must be close .
”
“
Yes , ” Crystal said .   
“
One second , be right back .
”
I glanced over the remaining outfits .   
Three more options .   
V - neck , long - sleeved , short skirt .   
Not bad , but very reminiscent of ‘ Glory Girl’ .
Round neck , low enough to have a touch of cleavage , short sleeves , and shorts that cut straight across the upper thigh .   
If any length were taken from them at all , they would n’t qualify as shorts anymore .   
Hard to pull off .   
I ’d need to accessorize it and I was n’t sure I could afford the time to dig for boots , belt , or other stuff
I ’d need , and still get filled in .
The last one had a high collar , a kind of truncated turtleneck , it was sleeveless , with leggings that ended in the mid - low calf .   
Not bad but not great , and again , I ’d need accessories .
Urg .
“ The two construction groups are collaborating , banding together , the areas rezoned , contracts reworked .   
They say workers signed and agreed , and there are no longer ‘ dibs’ , as you put it .
”
“
For something that matters as much as home and shelter , with that many employees , you ’d think someone would have read the contract thoroughly enough to figure that out .
”
“
I have no idea , ” Crystal said .
“ Sounds like someone ’s not being honest .
”
“
Again , Victoria , I do n’t know , ”
Crystal said , sounding a little exasperated .   
“
I’m- we ’re , if you ’re coming , we ’re not going there or being invited there to arbitrate or negotiate .   
We ’re not solving that particular problem .   
We ’re there to stand between the two sides , keep the peace .
”
I glanced at her jacket .   
“ Just following orders . ”
“
Following orders , keeping things simple , letting others handle things , ” Crystal said .   
“
Yeah .
” I nodded .   
“
Okay .
”
I picked up the second costume , with the low neck , short sleeves , and short leggings , and held it up against my front .
“
Go for it , ” she said .   
“
You definitely need to dress that up .
”
“ I know , ” I said .   
“
I ’m going to go get changed and see if I can find footwear .   
If you have a minute , could you find any belts ?
”
“ Utility or regular ?
”
“
Either or .   
I like the idea of utility
more , I think , for how I think I ’ll be dressing up .
”
I stepped out of Crystal ’s room , pulled the curtain closed by the balcony door and quickly stripped out of my top and the skirt .   
I picked both up and put them with my other clothes .
I experienced a brief moment of displaced emotion , as if my head and body were in Crystal ’s apartment , and my heart was somewhere in the past .   
In an exposed , open area that was n’t mine , was n’t comfortable , where someone could happen to step in and see me exposed at any moment .
The latent feeling of the hospital room .   
Of being in the care home .
Pulling the costume on helped .   
Deep breaths , the pull of the zipper as it closed at my back and pulled material tight against my chest and stomach .   
I fixed the legs , checked for bunching and wrinkles , and deemed it satisfactory .   
Not perfect in the way a costume made explicitly for me would be , but satisfactory .
I dug in boxes .   
I ’d packed my things with shoes and boots at the bottom , clothes on top .
“ Belts , ” Crystal said .   
I heard the clatter as the things were tossed onto the couch .   
“ Masks .   
Armband .
”
The bag rustled as it bounced off the couch and landed on the floor .   
the armband landed on the couch near the belts .   
A black band with the Gold Morning symbol on it .
“
Good throws , ” I said .   
Crystal was standing with her back to me .   
She ’d tossed them over her shoulder .   
“
You can turn around .
”
“
Thank you , ” she said .   
“
Do n’t spend too much time .   
It ’s late , it ’s dark , people wo n’t care too much .
”
“ I wo n’t .   
Where does the other Earth and the war fit into this ?
” I asked .   
I pulled out a pair of white boots .   
Shoes meant for a costume might have worked better , but I tended to prefer boots for the fact that they stayed on better with hard landings , kicks , and rough falls .   
Fourteen year old Glory Girl had learned that lesson : it was terminally embarrassing to have a petty criminal watch as you flew over to your lost shoe and put it back on .
“
The workers called a stop to all work .   
They ’re holding the houses , equipment , and building materials hostage , with some suggestion they ’ll destroy it all before they give up what they ’re owed , ” Crystal said .   
“
The last big convoy of materials and trucks were from another Earth , and they ’re part of what ’s being held hostage .   
The delivery folk from Earth - K are n’t budging because they are n’t abandoning their delivery , even though they ’ve been told they can go .   
The government from United States of K is getting upset because their people are n’t home
, That ’s where the murmurings of war are coming from .   
Workers are n’t conceding anything else , and construction groups are n’t either .
”
“
And our job is to make sure the stalemate stays stale and mate until people find a resolution , ” I said , pulling on the boots .
“ Or mitigate the damage if it gets ugly , ” Crystal said .
I did up the straps , reached for the belts
, all arranged around a metal ring , and found one
I was satisfied with almost right away .   
Utility - belt style with small pouches .   
I tore open the bag of masks .
The masks were ones that were meant to be stuck to the face .   
Remove protective tape , stick to face like cosmetic band - aids .   
Not my favorite , but I got why they did it when they sent out sample packs .   
The glue would wear out quickly , and the real custom masks for long - term wear would then be ordered .   
Quality was fine , though .   
All in white , again , some with lenses .
I found one that fit around my eyes and covered my eyebrows , with white lenses , and held it up to make sure the white lenses did n’t obscure vision any .   
A faint halo when I looked at sources of illumination , but nothing too bad .
“
What do you think ?
” I asked .
“ I think you look more like you than I ’ve seen you in a long time , ” she said .
“
Maybe I ’m meant to wear a costume , ” I said .
“ Maybe , ” she said .   
“
But what I meant , cuz , is that from the moment you stepped into my bedroom , well before you put anything on , you looked more focused and grounded in reality than you have in a while .
”
I drew in a deep breath , and glanced at the curtains .   
Being told I looked better reminded me that I had n’t looked well before , which reminded me of why I had n’t looked well , which in turn made me feel less better .
It was easier if I did n’t focus on it .   
“
Thanks , I guess .
”
“ Whatever you were doing , I think you should do more of it .
”
“ I plan to .   
But for now , in the interest of time , since your formation is expecting you to hurry back , I just need to know if the mask makes me look like a dork .
”
“
It ’s good , ” Crystal said .   
She picked up one article of clothing that I ’d put aside while digging for my boots .   
A plain white sweatshirt .   
“
To cover up the road rash ?
”
I looked at my arms .   
I still had the raised red marks where I ’d tumbled to the road .
“ Or maybe not .   
It would n’t work with your forcefield , ” she said .
It would , but I was n’t about to explain that whole situation .
“
No , actually , it could work , ” I said .   
“ Dress up the upper body some .
”
She smiled , enthusiastic that I was playing along .   
“
Exactly !   
I was thinking we could stick a quick heat - transfer design on this .
”
The sweatshirt as part of my costume ?   
It would be playing into that trend of working normal clothes into costumes .   
Fume Hood
’s group had been big on that .   
A few of the villains in Lord of Loss’ group had , too , but some of that might have been them trying to fly under the radar before launching their plan .
The most significant trends in fashion and style were often a symptom of external factors .   
It was hard to get good costumes with where things were at .   
There was a desire , too , to appear more down to earth , to connect to the people , when sentiment was where it was at .
“
Sure , ” I said .   
I smiled .   
“ That could work .
”
“ Question is , do you trust me to do it ?
” she asked , raising one hand and producing a fan of lasers from her fingertips , shooting at a forcefield she ’d created .   
“ Or
do you want to wait for the iron to get hot ?
” ⊙
The battle lines were drawn , so to speak .   
At least it was quiet here , the forces gathering in anticipation of the coming day .   
At the center of this particular battlefield was a single tall building , lit from bottom floor to top , even in the evening , with the power rationing being what it was .
The masses of construction workers had clustered in groups , the largest mass of them arranged around three sides of the building , kept on the far side of the street by the emergency services and the capes .   
Surrounding one of the construction company ’s headquarters .
Lights on poles , the lighting of the news crews talking to some key individuals , and the lights the workers were carrying served to illuminate that crowd .
From the bird ’s eye view , we could see some of the construction sites around the area , each roughly illuminated by the lights within , that light contained by the fencing that surrounded each building in progress .   
Construction vehicles , people , and collections of things cast long shadows with the lights set where they were .   
Most had lookouts posted , keeping an eye out for trouble .   
A couple of those lookouts turned lights our way as we flew .
Laserdream and I touched ground .
“ I ’ve missed flying with you , ” she said .
I smiled .   
My emotions were complicated enough in the moment that I did n’t want to say anything .   
I did n’t trust my tone of voice or the words I might choose .
Easier to stick to the shallow , surface response .   
It was nice to be around my cousin , nice that she was happy .
We walked down the length of the street , the building on one side , the crowd of workers on the other .   
Walking helped to get my blood pumping and my body warmed up , where flying felt like it had frozen my blood and chilled me .   
My hands were cold , and I kept them jammed in the pockets of my sweatshirt .
“
Laserdream .   
You ’re cutting it close in getting back in a timely manner .   
Who ’s this ?
” a cape in a jacket asked .   
He was a heavy guy with a very clean face , a gently curved visor covering his eyes and nose .
“ Family , ” Laserdream said .   
“
There was a call for more help , she was invited by someone named ,
uh … ”
“ Tempera , ” I said .
“ Tempera .   
Right .   
We ’re paying for the extra hands on deck ?
”
“ We are , ” the man said .   
“
It ’s not a lot .
”
“
That ’s fine , ” I said .
He looked skeptical .
“ I can second the recommendation if it matters , ” Laserdream said .
“
It helps , ” the guy said .   
“
If she causes trouble , you know it ’s your ass in the fire .
”
“
Understood , sir , ” she said .   
“ I ’ve been doing patrols with her since before I could drive .   
I ’d trust her with my life .   
I ’m optimistic my ass will remain room temperature .
”
“ Do n’t get smart .   
I do n’t want her with the formation .   
If she wants in , she needs to apply and train .
”
“
She doesn’t- ” Laserdream said , at the same time I said , “ I don’t- ” Laserdream ceded to me .
“
No disrespect intended , ” I said .   
“
That is n’t for me .   
But I get the gist of the situation , I ’ll help keep the peace , I ’ll follow any orders .
”
“ You going to be alright if I send you out to help fill in the gaps at the flanks ?
”
“
It ’s why I ’m here , ” I said .
“ South side of the building , ” he said , pointing .   
“
Stand on the dotted line , try not to stare down the crowd or antagonize them .   
Be gentle if they get rowdy .
”
“ Can do , ” I said .
“ Should be quiet tonight , ” he said .   
He turned to Laserdream as he said it , but glanced at me .   
Including us both in the statement .   
“
This is one of three locations .   
The big demonstrations are supposed to start tomorrow , at another location .   
Tonight they ’re mainly interested in holding their ground and organizing themselves .   
Holding a vigil , giving cameras something to record .   
Would be nice if they got over it or got bored before things get started tomorrow , but I do n’t think that ’s going to happen .
”
That would be why Tempera had said I could call in the morning .   
The workers wanted time and media attention to give their side some weight before they really took action .
“
Get yourself in position .   
I ’ll send someone your way with some cups of coffee in a short while .
”
“
Alright , ” I said .
The parahumans along the road to the south of the building were spaced out along the painted divider in the center of the street .   
One parahuman every fifteen or so feet .   
There were no barricades , only the lights on tripods , connected to battery packs , helping to illuminate most of the road .   
The ambient light from nearby buildings contributed .
The crowd was noisy , but it was a low , constant noise .   
Talk , conversation , the occasional raised voice .   
There was n’t a car to be seen on the street .
I could remember what had happened to Fume Hood .   
I closed my eyes for a moment , and I put my forcefield up , leaving it up .   
It made me uncomfortable , but a bullet would be even worse on that score .
The capes down the street to my left were all wearing Advance Guard icons on their sleeves and costumes .   
The stylized man bearing the ‘ greater - than’ shaped shield , charging forward .   
The color of the icon changed , depending on the costume ’s color scheme , but it was always such that it stood out , yellow on a red and orange costume , or purple on a blue - green one .   
The thick bold lines of the icon ’s design tended to flow into the cape ’s individual icon or the rest of the costume , the shield ’s lines or the diamond - shaped frame of the icon joining the line running down the seam of the sleeve or the lines running across the chest .
“
Who are you with ?
” the guy standing to my left asked .   
He had a face plate , with the thick bold lines and angular edges that Advance Guard tended to have , and the ‘ ears’ of the plate swept back to cover his ears , giving them a pointed , elfin cast .   
His bodysuit was designed to accent his slim frame , a two -piece jacket and legging combo , with a very pronounced zig - zag at the waist where the upper body met the lower body .   
There was a slight curl at the toes .
“
I ’m independent ,
” I said .   
“
For now .
”
“
We ’re Advance Guard , ” he said .   
“
I ’m
Spright .
”
“
I ’m between names , ” I said .   
“ And between costumes .   
Do n’t judge me too harshly .
”
“
Can I see the emblem ?
”
“ Just a design , not an emblem , ” I said , turning my back to him to show him the rush job we ’d managed with the heat - transferred image , my sweatshirt lightly singed in places .   
It was a circle with lines intersecting it , almost like a sun , but with the lines running into the circle .   
The image was offset , so the lines were shorter to the left and top of the image .   
Crystal ’s idea and design , and I ’d had no objection .
“ Between teams , between names , between costumes ?
”
“
More or less sums it up , ” I said .   
“
If you need to call me anything , you can call me Victoria .
”
“
I ’m honored , Victoria , ” Spright said , bowing slightly .   
“
I ’m glad for the company .   
We might be here for a while .
”
“ We probably will , ” I said .
“ I see you ’ve got the armband .   
You ’ve been around for at least a few years .
Do you have any war stories you can share ?
”
“
Yes , a good few , ” I said .   
And a lot I would n’t share .
“
You ’re experienced , huh ?
”
“ A few years under my belt .   
A few years of
semi - retirement . ”
“ I can tell you
I ’m very experienced , ” he said , with a bit of humor in his voice .
I looked at him , one eyebrow arched .
“
I ’ll tell you mine if you tell me yours , ” he said .
“ Is that how we ’re doing this ?
”
“ Could be , ” he said .   
“
What I ’m
offering is long and thoroughly satisfying .   
Are you game ?
”
“
Wow , ” I said .   
I smiled despite myself , looking over the crowd instead of at Spright .   
“
When they said Advance Guard rushes into things , they were n’t lying .
”
“ Once you get me going , I go all night .   
I might as well get started early .
”
“ With an audience , though ?
”
“
I ’ve got nothing to hide .   
I ’d say they could join in , but I think that would get a little hectic .
”
“ It might just , ” I said .   
“ Would be nice to steer clear of hectic for a while .
”
“
I very much agree , Victoria Between - things , ” Spright said .   
“
You have to find a good fit , strike the right rhythm , the right pace .   
Once you ’re comfortable , you might be able to vary it up some .
”
The woman standing to the left of Spright said something that sounded an awful lot like , “
Oh my god , Spright .
” I checked , but it did n’t look like the people on the sidewalk heard us .   
The buzz of conversation seemed to drown out our voices .
“
Is he always like this ?
”
I asked , raising my voice a bit .
“
Yes , ” Spright said .
“
No , ” she said .   
“
I dare say you ’ve inspired him .   
Unfortunately .
”
Spright sounded almost energized by his teammate ’s exasperation .   
“ I ’m intrigued more than inspired .   
I ’d love to indulge in your , ahem , stories , Victoria with the stylish icon .
”
“
It ’s not
that great an icon , ” I said .   
“
Nice try , though .   
I appreciate it .
”
“ I wanted to work in the flattery somehow .   
There ’s no shortage of things I could say , by the way , and I ’m not messing around when I say that .   
I chose the icon because I do like it , and because when you say something nice about something like a girl
’s
hair or something else about their appearance
, you tend to get that kneejerk resistance .
”
“ You do , ” I said .   
For me , it ’s for reasons other than the usual .   
It was a shame , but his moment of frankness had brought things home again .   
My tone of voice was audibly different even to myself as I said , “
I ’m
flattered , Spright , really .
”
“
Aw darn .   
But ?
”
“
But while I ’d be happy to share a few stories , I ’m not up for the other stuff you ’re driving for .   
It ’s just not where I ’m at .   
Would n’t be fair to you .   
I ’ve got ta figure myself out some , first .
”
“ I can respect that , ” he said .
“
Thank you , ” I said .   
“
I appreciate the wit .   
You were pretty snappy with some of that .
”
“
Thanks for letting me try , I-
”
Spright stopped as the woman standing to his left made a sound effect with her mouth .   
I did n’t hear the preceding sound , but I heard her make a sound like a small crash with her mouth .   
Spright switched tacks to say , “ I ’ll throw things at you , Tandem .
”
The woman laughed .
A moment later , another person joined us .   
A ripple in the road , and he appeared almost instantly out of the gloom .   
The cape I ’d met early in the day the community center had been attacked , with the blades jutting from his costume .
He looked at me , sizing me up .
“
Hi , ” I said .
“
Mmh , ” he made a sound , not really a response .   
“
Hey , Spright , swap places with me for a bit .
”
The ‘ mmh’ bugged me .   
“
I ’m enjoying his company .
”
“
She ’s enjoying my company , Shortcut , ” Spright said .   
“
It ’s a good night .
”
“
It ’s going to be a long night , ” Shortcut said .   
“
I think I know her from the other day .
”
He paused , glancing back at me .
“
Yeah , ” I said .
Shortcut turned back to talk to Spright , then paused , glancing back at me .   
“
What ’s that sound ?
”
I listened , and I heard it .   
Scratching .
Without trying to look too much like I was looking down , I looked down .   
My forcefield , invisible to everyone present , was scratching at the road .
I took flight , lifting myself up enough that the arms could n’t reach the ground .   
About eight feet up .   
From the angle , as I saw the light hit the road at a different angle , I could see the shallow gouges .
The good humor from earlier was spoiled a little at that .
“
Everything
okay ?
” Spright asked .
“
Yeah , just restless , bit of power quirkery , ” I said .   
I realized the crowd had noticed me take flight , and the conversation had quieted a bit .
It was mildly surprising that , Spright ’s flirting aside ,
nobody in a large collection of construction employees had called out to me .
I tested my luck , and used the opportunity to call out , “ You guys doing okay ! ?
”
“
Bit cool out !
” someone called back .
“
Yeah !
”
I called back .   
“
Better than the alternative , is n’t it ?
”
That got me a fairly mixed response .
“ Shoulder to shoulder in the heat , stinking of sweat ?   
You do n’t want that !
”
“
We ’re used to the smell of sweat , hon !
”
a woman called out .   
There were murmurs of agreement .
“ Take care of yourselves , okay ?
”
There were a few murmured and unintelligible responses , but a more emotional cry of , “ Give us our homes and we ’ll be just fucking fine !
” stood out .   
Some heads turned in that direction .
“
It ’s not up to us , ” I said .   
“ Save that energy for tomorrow ,
alright ?   
We ’re here to keep you safe and keep them safe .
”
There were a few mumbled replies .
“ Does n’t help , ” Shortcut said .
“
I dunno , ” I said .   
“
Letting them know we ’re not against them , we care about their well being ?   
Reaching out and talking ca n’t hurt , can it ?
”
“ I guess that ’s why I ’m
here , ” Shortcut said .
I looked his way .
“ Reaching out and talking , ” he said .   
“
I just wanted to make sure there ’s no hard feelings .
”
“ About you not getting into Advance Guard .
”
I ’d emailed , they ’d sent a reply a couple of hours later saying no .
“
I did n’t devote a lot of thought to it , ” I said .   
“ Sucks , but you guys have to do what you have to do .   
And so does everyone else , apparently .   
I ’ll figure something out .
”
“
They did n’t tell you it was me ?
”
“
No , ” I said .   
I frowned .
“
I told them to tell you no and to tell you it was me , and why .
”
“
Alright , ” I said .   
“
They just told me no .
”
“
Well fuck that .   
I thought you needed to know , what you did back there , it was shitty .
”
“
Beg pardon ?
”
“ I realized after your face came up on some of the events about the Norfair community center incident .   
You went up against Lord of Loss ?
”
“ I do n’t see what the issue is , ” I said .
“ You happen to beat me to the scene , and then you use your secret identity , condescension and anti - parahuman shit to take me down a notch ?   
And then you want a place on Advance Guard ?
”
“ I happened to be there .   
I ’m sorry ,
it was not my intention to come across that way .
”   
I tried to help you out some .
“
Yeah , ” he said .   
“
Right .   
I can guess what your intentions were .
”
I was pretty darn
confident my handling of the situation had been alright .   
I was inclined to chalk this one up to the guy having a screw loose or a few bundled up issues .   
It still bothered me , and it bothered me more that a nice conversation had been interrupted , and now this guy was apparently intent on keeping me company for the night , telling me how I was responsible for his problems and issues .
I pursed my lips , doing my best to filter what he was saying , tuning out what I could and responding where necessary , so he would n’t add me ignoring him to his list of grievances .   
He was talking about the community center now .
Voices were raised , a few shouts , both from capes at one of the other streets , and by people in the crowd .   
Phones were out .
It was almost a welcome interruption , in that solitary moment between the initial commotion and when I realized that it meant people were hurt .
I rotated myself in the air , looking , trying to figure out what had happened .   
I saw Crystal coming , and flew to meet her .
“
Come !
” she shouted , barely pausing as she flew .   
I joined her , wavering as air ripped past my forcefield , lopsided in a way I could n’t quite detect , moving .
I disabled the forcefield , and in the doing , I could fly straighter , but I flew against cold wind , unprotected .
Crystal did n’t explain .   
It was left for me to see .
Our site had been quiet .   
At least one of the other places workers were congregating was n’t .   
People were more spread out , and I suspected from their arrangement that some had crossed the street , approaching the building .   
There were more emergency vehicles , more capes , and there was a large clearing in the center of the crowd .
Eight people were gathered toward the center of that clearing , with more scattered across the more open area .   
Among them , several had eyes that glowed , or glows emanating from their mouths .   
Shapes I could n’t quite make out moved around them .   
A power at work , like the outline of something that glowed slightly in the dark , too abstract to make out .
I watched as two people broke from the edge of the clearing and ran toward the center group .   
A man and a woman , holding hands .
It hit me like a blow to the head .   
An image in my mind
’s eye , a feeling , a sense of something greater .   
Forgotten in the same instant it occurred .   
I dropped out of the air , and I caught myself a moment later .   
Crystal did much the same .
“ Get back !
” someone hollered .
A megaphone blared , “ Get away from the center !
”
The eight people were sixteen now , including the two that had run toward the center and some of the people that had n’t retreated to the clearing ’s edge .   
Eyes glowed , powers wreathed a few hands .   
A spike of power - generated material was stabbing skyward in front of a woman .   
A man had fallen to his knees , arms spread , and the ground was rippling around them .
People did n’t get away from the center .   
Realizing what was happening , or thinking they knew what was happening , others dashed toward the group , joining it .
“ Get back , ” Crystal said .   
“ If we get knocked out- ” I retreated , looking for where the defending capes were .   
Lit by flashing , noiseless sirens , the capes were clustered not far from the building .   
They were getting organized .
“
It ’s a broken trigger , ” I said .
“
Is it ?
” Crystal asked .
I flew straight for the heroes on scene .   
I did n’t get the chance to hear two words out of the leader ’s mouth before we were hit again .   
Every one of us winced and reacted as it hit us .   
Too brief to be a trigger vision , incomplete , fractured , it still made itself felt .








“ Evacuate !
”
One word from the parahuman in charge was all we needed .   
The clock was too short for anything more .
Capes fanned out , most of them on foot .   
I could leave the parts of the crowd closest to us to them .   
I flew , avoiding the sky directly over the group of affected people , circling around the periphery instead .   
The wind was cold against my face and legs .
The massed crowd of citizen workers was to my right , the people with powers to my left .   
Half of the light sources in and around the clearing had broken , and the only other illumination came from the effects of powers .   
A common thread ran through all of it .   
Energy spilled out and created matter where it splattered on the road , materials sprouted from nothing , streaked with thin streams of liquid that glowed like fire , and more abstract growths formed suspended in air , their images sticking to the backs of my eyes like the persistent afterimages of sparklers waved in the dark .
People were shouting .   
Some were screaming .   
I could n’t make much of it out .
I flew to the far side of the clearing , which also happened to have some of the thickest gatherings of people .   
They had been citizen laborers , gathering to make their displeasure known to the construction groups .   
They ’d been facing the building until the incident , they ’d backed up , and there were places where the presence of buildings and parked vehicles made it so they had no place to retreat , leaving them now packed together , shoulder to shoulder , front to back , jostling .
I ’d helped to evacuate before .   
I had attended the Leviathan attack on my hometown .   
I had been around for the majority of the Slaughterhouse Nine crisis .   
I ’d participated in other , minor incidents , helping with fires and storms , though those had mostly involved helping the elderly and standing around .
The truism was that in a disaster , people were their own worst enemies .
Never this bad .
I ’d never seen or imagined a situation where people would do the opposite of evacuating , throwing themselves headlong into the hazard .   
They thought the people in the center of the clearing were getting powers , and people were breaking away from the crowd at the clearing ’s edge to run toward the affected individuals .
Crystal created a wall to block off a street as she passed it .   
She would n’t be able to keep it up as she got further away , but it bought time for others to get there .
She raked a laser across the road , a bright and noticeable    distraction , to give people pause .
I dropped to the street , using a pulse of my aura to get people ’s attention .   
Some stopped to look , while others ducked low , as if instinct drove them to shy away from the perceived threat .
“ Run !
”
I shouted , using my aura to play up my words .   
“
Other way !
”
I saw eyes widen , and turned to look .   
A man had opened his mouth , and had something that looked almost as tall and thick as a telephone pole spearing skyward from his mouth .   
Blood streamed from the sides of his mouth , his jaw clearly dislocated , and more fluids painted the length of the pole as it continued to rise .   
It reached its maximum height , and then forked , the upper half splitting out into two equally thick portions , a giant ‘ Y’ shape .   
Each branch then forked into two , and forked into two again .
“
Go , ”
I said , sparing only a momentary glance for the people I ’d been stopping .   
I saw them start to run away .
The man reached up , his fingers dragging along the blood - slick shaft of the trunk of the fractal tree he had vomited up .   
Each movement of his hands was slower and weaker than the last .
I flew toward him , to do what I could to help , even though I was n’t sure what that could possibly be .
The ‘ tree’ toppled , and it was only because I was already on my way toward him that I was able to intervene .   
I reached out for the falling tree , and my power was quicker to touch it .   
Phantom fingers bit into the surface , fracturing the chalky material .   
With flight , my bare hands , my power , and my aura pushed out to give people a little more incentive to get out of the way , I controlled the tree
’s fall .   
It broke into chunks on contact with the ground .   
One of the people with new powers was pinned beneath branches , but it did n’t look like he was hurt by the contact .
I flew to the man who ’d grown the tree .   
Even before I reached his side , I could see the damage that had been done .   
Jaw , throat , chest , and stomach had been torn away .   
Traces of the same material that had formed the tree had collected in his insides and pelvis , breaking into jagged pieces at some point before or during the tree
’s fall .
He had no throat to feel for a pulse .   
I was n’t about to rule anything out , even as I saw the remains of his heart in his splayed - out chest cavity .   
I pried one of his eyes open , and I saw no response .
I went from a crouch to airborne in a second .
That particular disaster had been dramatic and visible for a significant portion of the people nearby .   
Most were thinking twice about running toward the epicenter .
When was the next wave coming ?   
The number of people to trigger all at once had seemed to double the last time .   
They did n’t look like multi - triggers either .   
One power each , some self - destructive .   
I could hear the screams and shouts of a lot of unhappy people
and I could n’t see one person who looked particularly happy about their new ability .
I flew to a new location , looking to see where I could get the most people away .   
The tree had done my work for me in one spot , Laserdream was standing at the intersection of two streets and walling them off with red - tinted , translucent fields .
I saw another group- people were pulling away from the crowd , which was actively trying to grab them and hold them back .   
Young people – older teenagers and twenty - somethings , that might have been a group of friends .   
Seven of them .
I shouted , but my voice was drowned out by the dentist - drill scream of a power somewhere nearby , by the hollers , the warnings , a dull explosion .
I used my aura again .   
Several people in the group stumbled , so caught up in reacting to my aura that they lost track of where they were going or how to put one foot in front of the other .   
Several others paused , helping their friends that had tripped , stopped , or fallen .   
The people at the edge of the crowd reacted too , pulling back away from me .
I ’d hoped more of them would stop shouting and screaming .   
The affected people and the people at the edge of the clearing were making so much noise that it nearly drowned me out as I shouted , “ Get back !
”
A number of people listened .   
The crowd in particular was inclined to take my order , getting away from the scene .   
Two of the seven who ’d lagged behind the others turned to go too .
Five , however , looked at me and then continued to run toward the scene .
I clenched my fist .
Rationally , I knew that they likely saw this as the simplest thing in the world .   
The people over there had powers ; all they had to do to get powers was to head over there .   
Some might well have no idea what triggers were , or they might have bought into one of the various other theories out there , some intentionally obscuring the truth .   
They did n’t know better .
Well , the screaming should have given them pause , but that might have been balanced out by the fact that they felt especially powerless at this time in particular .   
Because we were only two years after the most catastrophic and traumatic loss of human life in history .   
Because as much as we were recovering , we were far from being where we ’d been .   
We were n’t okay .   
The dispute between the citizen workers and the construction administrations only brought that home .
Rationally , I knew that .
Less rationally , I had a weak point that extended well before the Gold Morning , well before the hospital stay , well before the Slaughterhouse Nine , before the bad days against Empire Eighty - Eight , before my trigger , even .   
I ’d spent a fair portion of my time post - trigger and especially in the hospital , thinking about it .
I could n’t fucking stand being ignored .
I flew to intercept .
I had n’t practiced with this power enough .   
Even using it was a hard reminder , with a mental and emotional cost .   
I knew I needed to come to terms with it , and my time at the hospital had been an early foray into that .
That had been flight , and my flight was more or less untouched .
I flew low , approaching a car .   
As with the tree , all of my powers were up and active as I reached out in the car ’s direction .   
Phantom hands dug into the metal of the car ’s body , invisible fingers stabbing through .   
A mass of something pressed down on the hood , caving it in .
If I had any control over those limbs , it was n’t something that lent itself to fine touches .   
It did n’t work well with the careful , methodical , warrior monk approach .   
In this , in the instinct and the moment of frustration , I could only hope that what I wanted and what my power wanted were mostly in agreement .
I glanced up to make sure Laserdream was n’t watching .   
I was close enough for my fingertips to brush the car ’s paint as I swept my arm to one side , the holes and dents in the car twisting or opening wider as the phantom grip adjusted .   
The-
the other Victoria , the phantom Victoria that had never left the hospital , the wretch , threw the car .
I canceled my power momentarily , to force it to release its hold , so it would n’t fling the car into the people I was trying to stop .   
I let it reactivate a half - second later , flying forward in the car ’s direction .   
My defenses were up and sufficient to let me adjust the car ’s trajectory with a sharp kick to the side .   
Just to be safe .
It crashed into a parked car , upside down , its roof and windows shearing into the top of the other .   
A loud impact , metal scraping metal , a dozen windows on the two vehicles breaking .   
It was raucous , chaotic , sudden and surprising , in a stark contrast to the massive , enduring weight that seemed to settle in me .
Harder than flying .   
I could tell myself I was helping people , keeping them clear of danger , and it helped much as it had with the flying , but it was still hard .
The fact that a car had flown into another car twenty feet in front of them was enough to stop them in their tracks .   
I had their full attention now .
“ Get away !   
It ’s dangerous !
”
Some backed away , then ran .   
Two backed off but did n’t run .   
The last of them was a man about my age , who stepped closer to the cars , intent on climbing over them .
“ Get away !
” I was prepared to grab him as he climbed onto the underside of the car I ’d thrown .   
He continued to ignore me , finding his balance , stepping forward-
The fragment of a trigger vision hit me .   
The latest wave .
I saw only a flash of faces , and in seeing those faces , I saw the phantom self that clung to me .   
The impression lingered for only a moment before I realized the faces did n’t resemble mine .
The man had been springing forward from the car to the ground when the event had hit .   
I saw his legs swing forward , while his head remained in place .   
He dangled , suspended in the air .
I picked myself up off the ground , flying to him .
Gone already .   
No pulse , no light behind the eyes .   
He made a faint gurgling sound , but it was some biological process or symptom of what had happened , not a sign of life .   
He was pissing himself and shitting himself in death .
He dropped out of the air , and I caught him .   
It hardly mattered , he was gone , but it did n’t feel right to just let him fall .   
I eased him to the ground .
“
Please help !
”
I heard a guy shout , amid renewed and nearby whimpers and sobs .
I flew .   
The two who had drawn back but had n’t run- a boy and a girl .   
The boy was holding the girl , while she strove to stay on her tiptoes .   
Her face was turned skyward .
I flew to them , and I caught her , helping to hold her .
“ Hold her steady !
” the guy shouted .
I held her as steady as I could .
Another suspension ?
“
My neck !
”
the victim shrieked the words .   
A single glowing vein stood out on each arm , and glows on her legs suggested more of the same , but she barely seemed to care about it .   
Clear fluid was streaming from her nose , thinner than snot , with needle - thin streams of blood joining it .
“
We got you , ” I said .   
“
We ’re here , we ’ll support you .   
Stay calm .
”
“ I ca n’t move my head !
” she cried out .   
“
Every time- my neck !
”
“
Do n’t try , ” I said .   
The guy was looking to me for help , and I was n’t sure what to say or do .
“
My head hurts , ” she said , sounding very far away .   
Her words dissolved into a stream of whimpers and cries of ‘ ow’ .
I was supporting her weight , but it was n’t easy to do it from a strength perspective with my feet on the ground , and it was n’t easy to stay steady while flying .
“
Laserdream !
”
I shouted the words , top of my lungs .
“ Headache , ” the victim said , her eyes wide .   
“
My brain .
”
The guy looked at me again .   
This time I did n’t try to hide my expression .   
I knew I looked grim .
Her brain .   
The Corona Pollentia , the means by which powers were operated by the parahuman .   
Hers had been established , but not as a fluid , functional thing .   
It was a nail , taking her brain and fixing it to a specific position in reality .
Laserdream appeared beside me .
“
What happened ?
” she asked .
“ Give her something to stand on , ” I said .   
“
She ’s stuck .
”
The forcefield appeared below .   
The girl no longer had to stand on her tiptoes .
“ People are evacuating more now , ” Laserdream said .   
“
We need to handle the people toward the center .   
The waves are random .
”
I turned , looking at the guy .   
“
Do you know her ?
”
“
Not really .
”
“
Can you run ?   
Go tell people to get away , as fast as they can .   
This is bad .
”
“ You do n’t want to get caught in it , ” Laserdream said .
The guy nodded .
“
Bye Anne , ” he said .   
He let go of the girl , transitioning the grip entirely to me , then turned to run .
Anne .
She was making small sounds , guttural .   
One hand came up to touch the side of my face and my hair , clumsy , as if she did n’t have full use of her fingers .
One pat .
“
I ’m
sorry
Anne , ” I said .
She made another of the gurgling sounds .   
She was vomiting , I realized , and with her face fixed in a skyward position , there was n’t anything I could do .   
Anything I did to move her would add to the damage to her brain .
I hugged her , hard .   
After a moment , I felt her hug me back , clumsy but fierce .
It was only a moment later that she started to convulse , whole - body .   
I moved to try to seize her head and keep it from moving- a second too late .   
One wrenching , forced movement of her head and upper body , and the nail ripped through a good share of the material in its vicinity .
I caught her as she fell , and laid her out on the ground , placing her on her side .
“ We need to help others , Victoria .
”
“
Yeah .
”
Spooky , to take to the air again .   
I ’d seen the numbers of people affected double , roughly , and this was another doubling , to look at it .   
More artificial sources of light had broken , as space folded in areas , as things grew to obscure them , or as tendrils of energy lashed out like living things , distorting geography with each impact .
Matter creation , matter manipulation , matter distortion .
Over fifty people , if I had to guess .   
It could well have been sixty - four .   
They were too spread out for me to effectively ballpark .   
Many might well have died from their power expression or the ‘ nailing down’ of the brain .
There was no being polite , now .   
One person hesitating at what could have been the edge of the affected area .   
I did n’t even pause as I grabbed him by the wrist , picking him up off the ground , dragging him with me , me barely six feet above the ground , him with toes and shoes scraping the road
’s surface .   
I did n’t want the fall to be too rough if I was knocked out of the air again .
I half - deposited , half - threw him toward the crowd that still lingered .   
I pointed at the largest guy present .   
“
You .   
Make sure these people get away !   
Keep an eye on this one !
”
He looked spooked , and I was n’t even using my aura .   
He gave me a singular nod .
Another two , two men together .   
One of them fought me as I held him , trying to pry my hand free .
“ Assholes !
” he screamed , twisting my fingers , trying to get leverage to bend one backward .   
“ Keeping powers to yourselves !
”
I did n’t reply .   
I tightened my grip to keep him from getting any one of my fingers , and I saved my breath and my focus .
If this was turning out as badly as it looked like it was , the aftermath would be answer enough .
The guy who ’d fought me was deposited beside the first vehicle with flashing lights that was waiting at the edges .   
A fire truck .
“
Do n’t let him go back !   
And try to get further away , in case it expands !
”
I was already leaving before they could answer me .   
I heard the shouts , though .   
The answers .
Crystal was n’t using lasers or forcefields much anymore .   
Only flight , only manhandling .
I delivered two more armfuls of cargo , getting people clear of the danger .   
On my return trip , I saw the geography transforming .   
A culmination of everything up to this point .   
From matter generation , matter distortion , and matter transformation to … something that made the entire area look as though it was being smudged and smeared around , streets widening , buildings pulling back from the street .
Except-
no .   
No , this was a familiar smudging and smearing .   
One that worked with us .
You made it , little V , I thought .   
I felt emotionally numb from the series of events , the deaths I ’d seen , my momentary use of my power and how the feelings I ’d tapped in that moment were n’t easy to bring back into order .
There was only what needed to be done , the mission that stood front and center .   
It was difficult to execute effectively , but simple in how Glory Girl , Victoria , the phantom wretch and the capes
I was working with
could all agree it should be done .
Get people clear .   
Get them safe .
A woman screamed words that barely strung together , the heel of one hand pressed to her forehead .   
The other was pointed forward .   
She shot something that was only visible by the way light refracted at its edges .   
The projectile hit the ground , carrying forward like a cartoon mole and the elongated , humped trail of dirt it left in its wake .   
Unlike the mole , the hump was jagged , folded earth .   
Road folded up like complex origami .   
She was pinning people down , keeping them from exiting a building .
In the words I could make out , she wanted them to come help her , and in her actions she drove them away .
“
Stop !
”
I shouted to her .
She shot one projectile at me .   
Barely visible , it cut through the air , wind shrieking .
I did n’t want to kill her , and if her hand at her head was any clue that she was in similar straits to Anne and the other man , a light push could do horrendous damage .
I drew closer to the ground , defenses up .
Work with me , I told my power .   
My agent .   
My flight wobbled as I experienced the lopsided drag of a hand reaching down at one side , clawing at the ground as I passed it .
It did n’t create nearly enough debris .
I changed angles .   
I flew for the hump of origami road , two feet across , two feet tall , jagged and menacing .
I passed within a few feet of it , and let my forcefield hit it .
The hump of ground shattered explosively , blades of road cutting at my legs .   
But it did create a cloud of dust and debris .
She shot at me , and I reversed direction , passing the hump again , striking it .
The two passes created enough of a mess to block the view .   
I flew to the people the origami road woman had pinned down .   
“
Go , go , go !
”
I stood by with my defenses up , positioned to intercept any incoming projectiles .   
They took the chance to run for it .
This whole thing was a clusterfuck .   
How many people were caught ?   
How many were acting irrational ?   
What options did we have ?   
What the hell was I supposed to do ?
The origami woman did n’t send any attacks through the cloud of shattered road that I ’d created .   
The moment the group was out of sight and away , I was moving again .
A complete and total clusterfuck .   
I flew high , and I looked down , wishing we had more light on the scene .
I could see where the distortions were being utilized .   
The space between the people at the edges and the center of the effect was being extended , making the clearing larger .   
It made it harder for people to approach , carried fleeing people away .   
It meant the effect had to reach further if it wanted to catch anyone .
In the tension and the emotions that gripped me , I felt an isolated point of peace and calm I could grab onto .
Vista was here , Vista had made it through Gold Morning .   
She was one of the people I liked .   
A reason I was doing what I did .   
She was one of the good ones , she was doing good work   here , and I wanted to help her on multiple levels .
In that line of thinking , I found both the focus to think beyond mere instinct , and to realize what I could do .   
I knew how Vista worked .
“ It ’s Vista , ” Laserdream said .   
She ’d appeared beside me again .   
She had a flying cape with her .
“
Come on , ” I said .   
I flew for where the expansion of space seemed weakest , even pinched .
They were n’t on the streets .   
It was people in buildings .
I tore through a door , flew through a house .   
Nothing .   
I bumped into Laserdream and her PRTCJ friend on the way out .   
“ Search the buildings .   
Vista
’s power is weakest when it has people in its area .   
There are people near here .
”
We spread out .   
One building each , searching neighboring houses .   
I was midway through my search when I heard a whistle .
I flew to the sound .   
Vagrants , or just refugees from Gimel who had decided they ’d be more comfortable squatting in unoccupied , recently built houses than they were in the tent cities .
The three of us carried them clear .   
We were delivering them to safety when the next pulse hit .   
We were n’t hit , but I could see a glowing figure in the sky flicker and drop briefly before they caught themselves .
We took to the sky again , looking for pinched areas where things had n’t distorted enough .   
There were two spots , and both were already being addressed .
The area was clear .   
We found our way to where the Warden - affiliated capes had collected .   
They had gathered at the edge of the effect .
“ I think we ’re clear , Rocketround , sir , ” Laserdream reported .
“ We should be shortly , ” the leader said , glancing at a Foresight cape who stood nearby .
“
Yes sir , ” the cape said .   
A girl with a hood and blindfold .
“
How many ?
”
Rocketround asked .
“
Ninety two , if you include the ones in houses , ” she said .
Rocketround paused , staring down the length of the road toward the center of the vastly extended clearing .   
He spat .   
When he spoke , he managed a tone that pretty perfectly encapsulated what I and probably most of us were feeling , “ Fuck me .
”
Ninety two .   
Ninety two , many like Anne .   
Many wanting help .   
I wanted to fly in , to do something .
“ I want everyone clear of the area .   
We wait , we see what happens , ” he said .   
“
We see if it expands in reach with further pulses , but I do n’t want to give it anything .   
Not even any bounceback from reaching out and finding some of us .   
Let me know when the next pulse happens .
”
“
Yes sir , ” the blindfolded girl said .
Something in the distance crashed to ground .   
Another fixture like the fractal tree ?
Laserdream approached me , and she put an arm around me .   
I did the same for her .
There was small talk , people remarking on what they ’d seen .   
Horrible things .   
People buried alive by their own powers .   
A few cases like what I ’d observed .
“ Is Vista around ?
” I asked .   
“
That was her , right ?
”
I had n’t expected Rocketround to be the one to answer , but he was the one who spoke up , saying , “
She is .   
Upstairs , top floor .   
She said she needed a view and no interruptions .
”
No interruptions .   
I was disappointed .
“
Who ’s she with ?
” I asked .
“ Wardens , ” he said .
“
Good for her , ” I said .
“
Who are you and who are you with ?
” he asked .
“ Victoria Dallon .   
Nobody , yet .   
I ’ve been interviewing for teams .
”
“ She did pretty good work , ” blindfold girl said .
“
Thank you , ” I said .
“ When you three got the homeless out of the house , Vista said something under her breath .   
I think it was ‘ thank you’ .   
They were getting in her way somehow .
” I nodded .   
“
I ’m from her town .   
I was briefly her teammate .
”
It was so mundane
it was chilling and disconcerting , after the chaos we ’d just weathered .   
A few moments of horrible , of stupidity and damage and madness , and now we waited to see what happened next , waiting to see what the aftermath would be .   
We talked about dumb things .
“
What do you think ?
”
Rocketround asked .   
“
Not just asking you , Victoria .   
Anyone .
”
It was in that question that I saw the first real hint that he was shaken .   
He was doubting his own capacity in this .
“
This is going to hurt , ” another cape said .   
“ People were already feeling pretty beaten down , and …
ninety people ?   
We lost ninety ?
”
“ We do n’t know if all of them are in trouble , ” Laserdream said .
“ I think they might be , ” blindfold girl said .
Laserdream did n’t have a response for that .   
She only hugged me tighter with the one arm .
“
I think-
” I started .   
“ Just speculation .
”
“
Any clues or guesses about what ’s going on would be good ,
” Rocketround said .   
He was gripping his upper arm as he stood with arms folded .   
He ’d emphasized ‘ any’ , which only served to emphasize how little a clue
he and we had .
“
The broken triggers are pretty out there .   
Not a lot of consistent points or facts … except that they ’re big , ” I said .
“ Big ?
” a nearby cape asked .
“ They tend to cover a lot of ground .   
Shaker stuff .
”
“
Yeah , ” Rocketround said .   
“
That ’s come up in briefings .
”
“
Location , environment , and position matters a lot , ” I said .   
“
The capes closest to the perimeter were least mobile .   
I think the further they got from the center , the less flex there was .   
Until their agents would n’t let them move at all .
”
“ Typhlosis pointed that out , ” Rocketround said , indicating the girl with the blindfold .
“ We might want to make them stay put , ” I said .
“
Yeah , ” Rocketround said .   
“
We ’ll do that .
”
Someone else spoke up .   
A remark about common thread through the powers they ’d seen .   
Others chimed in .
I only half - listened .   
A lot of images stayed with me .   
The faces I ’d seen midway through the one fragmented trigger , the indents in the car as the phantom limbs had reached out for it , Anne .   
The lingering sensation of Anne clinging to me , hard , the touch on my face .   
I did n’t know what she had wanted to communicate .   
A last kind gesture ?
“ There we go , ” the blindfolded girl said .   
“ Pulse .   
Nobody else affected .
”
“
I ’m going to approach , ” Rocketround said .   
“ Roadblock ?   
I ’d appreciate it if you came .
”
“
Of course , ” a cape by the side said .   
A guy in heavy armor .
“
Protect me if we run into any trouble .
”
“
Only four left , ” Typhlosis said .
“ Four ?
”
Rocketround sounded surprised .
Laserdream
’s head snapped around .   
Looking at me , looking at Typhlosis .
Typhlosis continued , “
Only four alive , still .   
The rest went down .   
Eaten by their powers , or they tried to move when they could n’t , and their brains caved in .
”
I squeezed Laserdream ’s hand .
I might have been less surprised than her because I ’d read up more on how these things tended to go .
“
Let ’s go , ” Rocketround said .   
“ Anyone comfortable joining me , come .
”
They speed - marched toward the center of the effect .   
One hand on another cape ’s arm for support and guidance , Typhlosis directed us toward the nearest surviving cape .
“ Three , ” she said , as we got close enough to see him .
He was a man , mid - twenties .   
His legs and stomach were buried in a writhing mass of something very similar to the origami road I ’d seen earlier , materials made thin , folded many times over , until they did n’t quite seem to be three dimensions anymore .   
Some of those materials were the pieces of the twenty or so people in his immediate vicinity .
A lone figure , standing on a hill of the fallen citizen workers , caught up in the broken trigger ’s effect .
“ Do n’t move ! ”
Rocketround shouted .   
“ Alright ! ?
”
“ Not moving , ” was the response , quiet .
“
No using powers .   
Stay put , stay calm .   
We ’re going to find out a way to help you .
”
“ I do n’t think I can be helped , ” the man said .   
His head was bowed , and he could n’t seem to move it .   
His hair was long , tied back into a low ponytail , and it covered much of his face .
“
We can figure something out ,
” Rocketround said .
“ Two , ” Typhlosis said , quiet .
Two parahumans left .
The effect had caught over ninety over what could n’t have been more than fifteen minutes .   
Now there were two .
“
I ’m worried , ” the man in the clearing ’s center said .   
“
I can feel all the others .
”
He moved his hand .
Every body in the vicinity moved .   
A matching movement of hands , limp arms rolling off of sides or fingers digging into powdered sidewalk .
“
Do n’t move !
”
Rocketround called out .
“
I ’m on a brink , and I ca n’t see it , but I can feel it ,
” the man said .
“
Try not to think about it , ” Rocketround said .   
“
Okay ?
”
“
I can feel it , ” the man said .   
He was n’t paying much attention to Rocketround .   
“
All the way down to this vast well , partially filled with potential energy .   
Like I ’m on the lip of a volcano
and it ’s an impossibly long fall with only magma at the bottom .   
I do n’t know if I ’m better off throwing myself down into that or leaving it alone .
”
“
Leave it alone , ” I said , my voice joining more than one other person ’s .
“
What if my thoughts and brain get made into a part of that ?   
One piece in that thing ’s construction .   
What if it makes me immortal , forever a part of this thing ?   
A recording of me in there ,
how I think , how I do things .
”
“ We ’ve studied parahumans , powers and power sources a lot , ” Roadblock said .   
“
We ’re pretty sure that ’s not a thing .
”
“
Yeah , ” the guy in the clearing ’s center said .   
“
But … ” He trailed off .
“
It ’s not a thing , ”
Rocketround ’s
voice joined Roadblock ’s .
“
But I ’m standing closer to it than you are , ” the man said .   
“
And from where I stand , I feel like it might be .
”
Nobody had a ready response to that .
“ One , ” Typhlosis murmured .
“
I ’m the last one standing on the brink now , ” the man said .   
“
I do n’t think I can do this much longer .   
Do I embrace it or turn away ?   
I wish I could see you , to-
”
He reached up , to move his hair out of his eyes .
“
Do n’t !
”
I called out .   
My voice was n’t the only voice of protest , but it might have been the first .   
Perhaps because I was most mindful of arms that were n’t mine , in my immediate vicinity .
The arms of people all around him operated as extensions of him .   
A matching , reaching movement , up and out .   
Some disintegrated as they moved , but one lying next to him reached up , out , and into the finely spun construction of road that cocooned the man ’s legs .
As I ’d done to the altered road , the reaching arm broke the construction like it was sugar crystal or a snow globe .   
There was a spray of blood , and the man dropped , jerking as his Corona Pollentia remained in place , briefly suspending him .   
He was dead in that instant , well before he sprawled to the ground , shattered from the waist down .
My hand held
Laserdream ’s tight .
I was thankful that Typhlosis did n’t give us an updated count .
⊙ Crystal had backed me up for a good while .   
She ’d been a friend , a support .
She had performed during the event .   
She ’d been focused , she ’d done what she needed to do .   
It had been after that she faltered .   
Hearing that the people who ’d been touched by the broken trigger were n’t doing well , then hearing that only four remained .   
Hearing and seeing those four drop away .
It had been that way for Leviathan , too .
It had probably been that way after I went to the hospital .
Fine during , not so fine after .
It had been ten days , now .   
Ten days after the broken trigger with the citizen workers .   
One of the worst we ’d seen for citizen casualties and damage .
I landed on the balcony , letting myself in .   
I took the carton out of the plastic bag and popped it into the microwave , lid ajar .   
Eighteen seconds .
“ Vic ?
”
Crystal called out .
“
I ’m here .   
One second .
”
“
That had better not be what I think it is .
”
“ It is .
”
Crystal groaned audibly .
I pulled the carton free , grabbed some spoons , and walked over to the living room .   
Crystal was sitting in the armchair , watching TV , a blanket on her lap .
She glared at me , but it was a mock glare , and it softened considerably as she saw the carton .
“ Slightly melted brownie caramel ice cream , ” I said .   
I collapsed onto the couch , reaching high overhead to hold the carton and a spoon out to her .   
“
I ’ll share it with you .
”
“
Well , if you ’re sharing it …
”
“ I ’ll exercise with you too , to work it off .   
For now , though , it ’s comfort food , staying cozy , and keeping each other company .
”
“
Okay .   
You ’re mostly forgiven .
”
“ And a stupid - in - a - good - way movie to watch
, ” I said , pulling the movie case out of the pocket I ’d wedged it into .   
“
Because it turns out TV sucks after the world ends , and I ca n’t watch you subject yourself to it .
”
“
Okay , ” she said .   
“ You ’re forgiven .
” I popped the movie in , then settled on the couch , pulling a blanket over my legs , arranging a cushion to sit up against .   
I fetched my phone and checked my messages .   
A second cancellation from Jessica .
After a disaster like that , too many people needed looking after .
I twisted my head around to look at Crystal , as she ate a spoonful of icecream from the carton .   
She passed it to me and I took a bite for myself , from the side she had n’t dug into .   
I passed it back , watching as the movie started .
My turn to look after Crystal .
⊙
The lights were off in the coffee shop , though it was n’t dark with the light coming in through the windows .  
The majority of the customers were sitting on the outside patio , and the interior was quiet , empty , and cool .
It was eerie , to go from the disaster to the more or less quiet period after .   
To be back on this street , where the car had hit the pillar , and where I ’d seen so much grief from one person , and to try and reconcile that with the broken trigger , the ninety dead , the fact that so many were dealing by ignoring it .   
Moving on a matter of two weeks after the fact .
“ Victoria ?
”
the barista asked me .
My first thought was that she ’d recognized me .  
“
Yes ? ”
“
Your friend stepped into the back .  
She said she ’d be right out , but she asked us to keep an eye out for you so you did n’t think she was late .
”
“
Got it .  
Thank you .
”
“
Can I get you anything ?
” I looked outside .   
Sunny , warm .   
The summer and its heat lingered in the daytime .   
“ I ca n’t bring myself to drink anything hot when the weather ’s like this .  
Do you have any suggestions ?
”
“ Ice coffee ?  
Iced tea ?  
Pop ?
”
“ Iced tea , please , ” I said , noting the use of ‘ pop’ .   
A lot of people from a lot of regions had gathered in the megalopolis .
I did n’t have to sit down and wait for her to bring it to me .  
It was in my hands within a matter of seconds , and I took it to the seat furthest from the door , where Jessica and I would have some privacy .
She was out of the washroom before I ’d fully settled in .  
Her blouse had buttons at the front and a collar , but was sleeveless , tucked into shorts .  
I wondered if she looked less at ease in casual clothing because she was a professional at heart , or if it was personal bias and years of knowing her as the therapist in the office that colored my perceptions .  
Her hair was damp , and she had what might ’ve been a folded paper towel , soaked with water , resting on the back of her neck .  
She collected a drink she must have ordered and paid for earlier .
“
Doing alright ?
” I asked .
Jessica smiled .   
“ I was cooling down .  
I ’ll be glad when the weather is more comfortably cool .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .  
“
It ’s not that I mind the heat .  
It ’s that I worry about how it affects people .   
I get antsy when the weather is like this .
” Jessica nodded .  
She glanced out the window .  
“ It does n’t help .
”
“
Brockton Bay was always nice , weather - wise .  
It did n’t have a lot going for it , but it did have mild weather .  
Once upon a time .
” Jessica smiled .  
“
It ’s good to remember the good things .  
At the risk of slipping into habit , I ’ll ask : how are you doing ?   
You ’re okay , after the broken trigger incident ?
”
“
I ’m
okay .   
My cousin was n’t , but she ’s bounced back .   
I think it was a wake - up call .
”
“
How so ? ”
“
She might be reconsidering if she wants to be with the PRTCJ .   
She might aim for something lower - key .   
Her mom did , after things went bad in Brockton Bay .
”
“ I hope she ’s happy and comfortable , wherever she ends up .   
I did like her , when she and I crossed paths .
”
At the hospital .   
That fragment went unspoken .
“
How ’s the girl I found ?
” I asked .
“
She ’s managing .   
We ’re getting her stabilized and figuring out her power .   
She wants to meet you at some point , to thank you .
”
“
She ’s good , though ?
”
“ Far better than she was .
” I nodded .
“
The broken trigger aside , how have you managed since we last talked ?   
You talked about joining a team .
”
I gave her a one - shoulder shrug .  
“ Pitched myself to a few .  
It did n’t take .  
I lost my job , the volunteer stuff feels empty .  
I ’ll survive in the meantime .
”
“ I find it very interesting that you asked about Hunter , and you wanted to clarify that she was n’t just managing , she was good .   
Then I ask you , and your response is that you ’re surviving .   
You ’re managing .
”
“ You ’re going therapist mode on me , ” I remarked , smiling .
She smiled back .
“
How are you ?
”
I asked , before she could ask me the same .
“
I ’m settling into my new role , trying to wrap things up and make sure there are no loose ends as I transition .  
Are you-
”
“
You said-
”
I said , inadvertently interrupting her .
“ Go ahead .
”
“ You said you were busy .  
Is busy a good thing , in Jessica - Yamada - land ?
”
It took her a second to answer .  
Not our usual one - sided dialogue , this , her talking , me waiting for a chance to communicate , already plotting how I could say what I wanted to say as efficiently as possible .  
I smiled at the observation , and I was left pretty sure she caught it , because she smiled again .
She replied , “ I ’m looking forward to when I have more time .  
Right now , it ’s balancing out .  
Any exhaustion on my part is easier to deal with because the things I ’m doing are new , exciting , a little terrifying , but positive overall .
”
“
Terrifying ?   Because of the people you ’re dealing with , or … ?
”
“ When working with patients , the first and last meetings are the hardest , with the stakes greatest , and I ’m having an awful lot of first and last meetings these days .  
Maintaining course after the initial connections have been made is easier .  
I know who I ’m talking to and what I ’m doing , there will be peaks , plateaus and valleys , but I can generally feel like there ’s progress being made .  
The first meetings and the goodbyes ?  
They ’re critically important .
”
“ You want to make sure you ’re laying good groundwork .
”
“
It ’s not just that .  
The wrong kind of connection or break can do a lot of damage .  
Failing to realize you ’re hurting a patient when you say something or take an approach , failing to be strong enough from the outset with patients who need a hard line , being too hard on patients who need a soft touch …
” I nodded .  
I started to think about which I ’d been , back then , but thinking back was hard and unpleasant .
“
I …
”  
She ’d started to say something , and then stopped .
“
You ?
”
She sighed , leaning back in her seat .
“ I ’ve put myself in an awkward position here , ” she said .  
“ Actually a few , including you and me sitting here having this conversation .  
I want to get right to it so you ’re not talking to me under the wrong pretenses , but I ’m not sure how to navigate this , either .
”
“
Is there anything I can do to help ?
”
“
That ’s just it , ” she said .   
She frowned .   
“ I wanted to have a conversation with you for another reason .
”
That stung , in a way .   
That we were n’t meeting up for the sake of meeting up .
“
Okay , ” I said .








“ A mistake ?
”
“ I worry it ’s the case .   
Time will tell , but I can make educated guesses and I have concerns .
”
“ I have to admit
, I ’m not sure how to respond to that , ” I said .   
“
I ’d say you ’re only human
or you ’re only mortal , but does n’t that sound condescending , coming from a parahuman ?
”
“
We ’re all mortal , Victoria .   
Even Scion was .
” I nodded .
It was strange to hear that name spoken out loud .   
Nine out of ten times , people would avoid saying it out loud .   
As if they could n’t reconcile the first hero with the thing that had ended the world .
“ I ’d like to help , ” I said .   
“
A couple of things are off the table , obviously , but you know what they are , I think .   
I would n’t be okay if you wanted me to reach out to my sister , or that kind of thing .
”
“ I would n’t ask you to do that , no .   
This is n’t anything of that scale , but … ” she frowned .   
“ Given our relationship , with you having been my patient
, there ’s a power imbalance .   
I want to do what I can to ensure I do n’t abuse it .   
I want to be fair to you .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .   
After a pause , I added , “ I appreciate the sentiment .
”
“ Even if this turns out to be minor , it is hard to do without risking a breach of trust and damage to our friendship .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .
“ I want to ensure we ’re on the same page , when it comes to expectations .   
I definitely do n’t want you to feel obligated , whether it ’s because you feel you owe me something , or because you feel you should .   
I know there ’s a tendency among heroes to want to step forward and help .   
I ’ve counseled many a junior hero that they needed to learn to pick their battles .
”
“ I have no idea what you mean , ” I said .   
“
I pick my battles .   
Except for the broken trigger last week , the community center , and , oh , everything else .
”
“
It is a concern , ” she said .   
She matched my smile with a small one of her own , but it was fleeting , more an acknowledgement of the joke than anything .   
“
You ’re quick to say you want to help , before you even know what I ’m going to ask .
” I nodded .   
“
I do n’t think you ’d ask if you had n’t thought over it .   
I trust you .
”
“ I ’d still be concerned , grateful as I am for your trust in me .
”
I swished the ice in my iced tea .
“ I am sorry , ” she said .
“
Sorry ?
”
“ If I ’ve upset you , approaching this like I have .
”
“
Did I give you that impression ?   
That I was upset ?
”   
I was pretty sure my face had n’t betrayed anything .   
I was reasonably sure my power was n’t leaking , either .
“ You did .   
And if I ’m right about that , please do n’t misunderstand me , I am sorry , and I would n’t fault you for being upset .   
I would like to have meetings like the one I think you were anticipating today .   
You and me , staying in touch to a degree , talking over iced tea and ice coffee .   
I ’d hoped to have one of those meetings before getting around to this topic .
”
So it was n’t too urgent , then .
“
Okay , ” I said .   
I took another careful sip of my iced tea .
She drew in a deep breath , reached back to where the damp , folded paper towel was laying against her neck , and set it within the lid of her iced coffee , which she ’d put to one side .   
She stared down at it for a moment .
I waited .   
I had some ideas about what she was getting around to .   
I also had things I might have said , but I was worried that , depending on what she was going to say next , they could be things I ’d regret .   
If her reasons were good , if they were personal … I was so fucking done with regrets .   
I did n’t want to add more , especially any tied to Jessica .
“ I do n’t want to compound my mistakes elsewhere with one here .   
With that in mind , I want to make it absolutely clear that this is n’t an obligation .   
I ’d like a bit of help , if you heard me out and were comfortable giving it .   
I ’d explain the situation as best as I could , but the confidentiality of other patients makes things difficult .
”
“
What do you need ?
”
“ Before we get into that , touching back on what I said before about wanting to be fair to you , I ’ve contacted a colleague .   
He ’ll be your therapist if you still want one .   
He ’s waiting for your call and he ’ll make an appointment with you .
”
“ You did n’t have to do that .   
I would n’t want to burden you guys more .   
What ’s going on , that you ’re going to all this ?
”
“
Maybe it ’s necessary , maybe not , but it ’s my apology and my thanks to you for having this conversation with me , and for any compromise of the relationship .   
It does n’t mean you have to hear me out , and it absolutely does n’t mean you have to say yes .   
Alright ?
”
“ Alright , but it does n’t matter , ” I said .   
“
I ’ll hear you out .
”
“
It matters to me , ” she said , firm .
“
Okay , ” I said , a little exasperated .   
It was clear Jessica was stubborn when she was bothered by something .   
“ Fine .   
You made a mistake , you want my help .   
I ’ll phone your colleague and possibly go see him .   
I ’ll weigh what you ’re asking
and I ’ll try to make an objective decision .   
Which may be no .
”
“ Thank you .
”
“
What do you need ?
”
I asked , again , holding my iced tea in both hands .
⊙ Mrs. Yamada was n’t ‘ Jessica’ anymore , not any more than capes went by their civilian names in costume .   
She was in her professional attire , a suit jacket over a blouse , a business skirt , minimal jewelry , minimal and tasteful makeup .   
Papers rustled as she paged through files and as the wind blew into the room .
She had told me to dress in a way that was comfortable for me .   
It was still hot out and I ’d had to travel forty miles to get to a place where Mrs. Yamada could pick me up to drive me the rest of the way .  
Even though the heat persisted , the weather had broken , the humidity giving way to a light thunderstorm .  
I wore a white dress with a black hood built into it , the Brockton Bay skyline printed in what looked like black and grey watercolors across the breast , the city ’s name below and to the side .  
There was a scribbling of more watercolor and lettering at the hem .  
The white fabric was a thin sweatshirt - like material , so the hood had n’t been much use against the rain .
The windows were open and the blinds closed , periodically clacking against the windowsills .  
The wind was n’t blowing in a direction that sent the rain into the room , but droplets still beaded the blinds closer to the bottom .  
The lights felt artificially bright , in contrast to how dark the clouds and sky were outside .   
The room was set up like a high school classroom , minus the ‘ class’ , no students , no mess , no bulletin board with scraps on it or whiteboard with weeks - old marks that had n’t been wiped away .  
Eight chairs were arranged in a ring at the center , instead of five columns of six desks .
There was a teacher ’s desk at the front , and Mrs. Yamada was there , looking over some files .  
I ’d caught some glimpses of the pictures on the fronts , purely by accident .  
I could have pried more , maybe caught a name or a heading by reading upside - down , and I ’d decided not to .  
She would n’t have wanted me to .
“
Do I have a file ?
” I asked .  
She startled a little , as if she ’d forgotten I was there .
She ’d been in the zone , I realized .   
She might have needed to be .   
She did n’t wear it on her face or in her body language , but there was a reason she was so immersed in what she was reading .
I could relate to that , in a way .  
During my hospital stay , I ’d delved deep into my studies , struggled with the keyboard as I read everything I could find , while furthering my studies with long - distance education .
“
Sorry to interrupt , ” I said .
“
It ’s fine .   
You did have a file .   
You do n’t now
, I ’m afraid .   
Unless it ’s somewhere in the rubble .
” I nodded .
She glanced at the clock .  
“ One of the group ’s members tends to arrive early .  
She should be here momentarily .
”
I looked up at the clock .   
One fifty in the afternoon .   
From how dark it was outside , I might have thought it was five hours later in the day .   
“
Good to know .
”
“ It will be interesting to see how you two get on .
”
“ Huh .
”
I heard the footsteps and glanced at the clock again .   
Not even a minute had elapsed .   
Was this person that punctual ?
I was n’t sure what I ’d expected .  
She was n’t yet a teenager ,   or if she was then she was a late bloomer , but she was n’t wholly a ‘ child’ either .   ‘ Tween’ .  
My first thought was that she was as cute as a button , and not in the pink princess way .
She was black , her arms and legs long and skinny , her eyes large in proportion to her face .  
She was studying me with just as much or more intensity than I studied her , as we sized each other up .
She was dressed or had been dressed with an eye for modern fashion , fitting to her age .  
She wore a blue corduroy pinafore dress with metal studs forming a star shape at the leg .  
Her top was a t - shirt , with an image on it in sequins , the kind that had two different images , depending on the direction the sequins were swept .  
The image depicted a blue heart if brushed one way , a yellow star if swept the other ; I knew because it was a jumbled mix of both .
The reason I thought that she might have been dressed by someone else was that she was so very precise about how she ’d put her outfit together .  
It was freshly ironed or fresh off the rack , and it was color matched from her shoes to the pins and ties in her hair .   
The star theme too .   
Kinky black hair had been fixed into place at the side of her head with a star pin , and carefully arranged into two small , tight buns at the back .  
Glossy and taken care of , not a strand out of place .  
It would have taken me twenty or thirty minutes to do the same , and my straight hair would have been easier to manage , even being as long as it was .
“
Hi , ” she said .
“
Hi , ” I responded .
“
Gosh , you ’re pretty , ” she said .
I was momentarily lost for words .   
Very direct .
“
Thank you , ”
I said , glancing back at Mrs. Yamada , hoping for a cue .  
She was focusing on her notes .  
She briefly met my eye , but communicated nothing .
“ I can tell you were a hero .  
You have that air about you , ” the girl said .
“
Thank you , ”
I said , a little caught off guard .  
“
It ’s nice to meet you .
”
She smiled , her enthusiasm renewed , “
It ’s amazing to meet you .  
I ’m really interested to hear what you have to say .  
I really want to be a hero , so I ’m trying to learn all I can .
”
“ That could be good .  
It ’s better than the alternative , at least .
”
“ Is n’t it ?  
You were probably a good one , were n’t you ?  
You give me that impression .  
You ’re stylish , I really like your dress , and you have that posture , back straight , unyielding .  
Only the best and the true up - and - comers have that .
”
“ Kenzie , ” Mrs. Yamada said .
“
Yes ?
”
“
There ’s no pressure .
”
Kenzie only smiled in response .
“
It ’s okay , ” I said .  
I was glad to have a window to speak .  
“ I like your outfit too , Kenzie .  
Good clothes are so hard to get these days , are n’t they ?
”
“
This outfit was part of a birthday present , but I think it was expensive ,
yeah .  
I wanted to look nicer since we had someone new today .
”
“
There ’s no need to go to extra trouble .  
Not for me .
”
“
No trouble , no trouble , ” she said , very cavalier .  
She looked at Mrs. Yamada , “ How are you today , Mrs. Yamada ?
”
“
I ’m doing very well today , Kenzie .  
How are you this morning ?
”
“
Ca n’t complain , ” Kenzie said .  
“
Does it matter where I sit ?
”
“
Nothing ’s changed from the prior sessions .   
Sit wherever you ’re comfortable , it does n’t matter .
” Kenzie smiled .  
“ I think it matters .   
It means something .   
Can I sit here ?
”
“
Sure , ” I said .
She seated herself in the chair next to the one I was standing beside .
I snuck a glance at Mrs. Yamada , and I saw concern .  
Because of the others who were due to arrive ?
“
You probably caught my name , I ’m Kenzie .
”
She was extending a hand for me to shake .   
I shook it , then turned the chair a bit as I sat down .  
“ Victoria .  
Some call me Vicky , but I ’m using that less these days .  
You can use it if it ’s easier .
”
“
And you ’re a heroine ?
”
“ I used to be .  
I ’m on hiatus .
”
“
That ’s the coolest thing , ” Kenzie said .  
“ Costumes , fighting bad guys .
”
“
It had its ups and downs , ” I said .  
I glanced at Mrs. Yamada .  
Her focus was on her notes .
She noticed me looking and asked , “ You used to be her patient ?
”
“ I did .
”
“
She ’s the best , ” Kenzie said , leaning over and speaking with a voice quiet enough that Mrs. Yamada would n’t necessarily hear .
“
Yeah , ” I said .  
Except for her apparent mistake here , which I was n’t equipped to make a judgment call on .  
Not quite yet .
“
It ’s good here ; I always look forward to coming .  
Everyone ’s pretty neat .  
That might not mean a lot coming from me , though .
”
“ How come ?
”
“ I think everyone ’s pretty neat , ” she said .
“ I see .  
That ’s admirable .
”
The papers rustled .  
Mrs. Yamada put the files in a filing cabinet beside the desk at the end of the room , locking them away .  
She spoke aloud , “
Can I get you two anything ?  
Water ?
”
“
I ’m fine , but thank you , ” Kenzie said .
“
No thank you , ” I said .
“ The others may be a bit late , with the weather being what it is .
”
“ I think we ’ll survive the wait , ” Kenzie said .  
“
Right , Victoria ?
”
“ We ’ll survive .  
Past years have taught me patience , if nothing else , ” I said .
“ From being a Ward ?  
Were you a Ward ?
” Kenzie asked .
That was n’t where or why , I thought , but I said , “ Very briefly .  
My family had a team .  
Still does , kind of .
”
Very kind of .
“
Oh , wow , neat .
”
I tried to find a diplomatic way to respond to that .
“
Or not so neat ?
” Kenzie said .
“ Ups and downs , ” I said .
“ I was with the PRT , but I was n’t a Ward exactly , ” she said .  
“ They had trouble sticking me anywhere , and then I went into training , and got to do a lot of really neat camps and exercises and travel , because they had to wait until I was old enough before they could put me where they really wanted to put me .
”
“
Which was ?
”
“ Watchdog , grrr , ” she said .  
She ’d made a pretty sad attempt at a growl , mischief in her eyes .  
“
That other branch that worked under the PRT that you almost never hear about .  
Oversight and investigation , powers , money , and politics .
”
“ I know of Watchdog .
”
“ Cubicle superheroes .
”
“
They ’re actually pretty badass from what I heard , and they do- did a lot of fieldwork and investigations , raiding offices , interrogations , talking to politicians , uncovering conspiracies .
”
“
That ’s true .
”
“
There ’s something about getting organized and going after that thinker or that tinker who ’s been working behind the scenes , the guy that ’s been subverting society for their own gain , when they ’ve probably spent months or years making contingency plans and anticipating the day their world and their plans come crashing down around them .   
I think that dynamic is pretty damn cool , the approach and the complexity of it .
”
“
Hmm , that is cool , ” she said .  
“ Except there are n’t any awesome costumes or monster fighting .
”
“ Less monster fighting , I ’m sure .  
I ’m not sure about the costumes .  
There are probably masks , I guess ?
”
“
And there ’s some cublical- bleh .  
Cubicle jockeying .
”
She spoke so fast she had tripped over the word .
I replied , “ Probably a lot , yeah .  
But from my short stint in the Wards , there was a lot of paperwork there too .
”
“
That ’s so true .  
I was kind of a Ward , so I had to do some .  
I think I was good at the paperwork .
” I was starting to feel like she ’d been the one who had fussed with her appearance , rather than any parental figure .  
Someone so fussy would ’ve somehow been mentioned in the life story to this point .   
It was very believable , too , to draw a connection between the fastidious appearance and her pride in the paperwork .
“ I think I was too .
”
She nodded , the conversation momentarily , almost mercifully pausing , then she found her place , enthusiasm returning .  
“
So yeah .  
I was bouncing all over the place .  
The Youth Guard stepped in ,
I ’m not sure if you ’ve had to deal with them .
”
The Youth Guard or the Y.G. were the group that acted like the union that protected minors in Hollywood .  
That had protected minors in Hollywood .  
They were the group that made sure that Wards’ education and options did n’t suffer as a consequence for them being superheroes , that they did n’t dress provocatively , that they were safe and sane , that nobody took advantage , and other stuff .  
They ’d reached out to my parents at one point , because they were n’t limited to the PRT .  
They were a guillotine that had hung over the heads of any team with under - eighteen heroes or heroines .
“ I ’ve heard the horror stories , ” I said .
“ They were n’t a horror story for me .  
They said I was being moved around too much and I needed to go somewhere to stay .  
Not going to the fun camps and training sucked , but I went back to Baltimore , and I got to set up my workshop , fi - nuh - ly .
”
“ Workshop , huh ? ”
“ Kenzie , ” Mrs. Yamada spoke up .   
She still sat at the desk .   
“ You might want to be mindful of what you reveal .  
I ’ll get into that more when things get started , but take a moment and think before revealing things that might tie into your cape identity , or identifying parts of your background .
”
“
Yes , Mrs. Yamada , ” Kenzie said .  
Then she leaned close to me , whispering , “ I took a moment to think
and I think I ’m safe
telling you
I ’m a tinker .
”
“ Gotcha , ” I said , mimicking her volume and whisper .
“
Yep , ” she said .   
She pitched her voice lower , “ The Youth Guard was good to me .  
I liked the people who I worked with there , even if the people in charge of me did n’t .  
Some of my favorite people next to Mrs. Yamada worked for them .  
Not that that lasted for long .  
That was only the spring of twenty - thirteen- ”
As she talked , I glanced at Mrs. Yamada .   
It was clear she heard .
“
-and
then , well … ”
“
Yeah , ” I said .
Gold Morning .
I was a little caught off guard by Kenzie , on a few fronts .  
This was n’t what I ’d expected .  
I glanced at the other chairs .
⊙ I got into a more comfortable position in the little booth , leaning against the window and taking a moment to digest what Mrs. Yamada had shared .  
Someone else walked into the dark little shop , going straight to the counter , their eyes on the desserts behind the display .
“ Group therapy ?
” I asked .
“
With the full - time position I ’m taking with the Wardens , I have the chance to help a lot of critical individuals .  
The people I ’ll be helping will be people who can help a lot of people in turn .  
An incredible number , in some cases .  
As attached as I am to my current patient caseload , and as much as I would like to take you on as a patient , it made the most sense to go this route .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .
She frowned a little .
“
But ?
” I asked .
“
The role I held between Gold Morning and now was always going to be a transient one .  
My patients and everyone else involved knew I was only seeing the patients I ’m seeing now in a temporary way .  
I ’m one of several therapists who are rotating through a patient caseload , and only half were my patients and mine alone .  
In making a transition , it is and was still my responsibility to look after those exclusive patients .
”
“
Okay .
”   
I connected that thought to how she ’d found a therapist for me .   
When it was a chore to get therapists to take new patients , it amounted to a pretty meaningful gesture .
“
I ’m
referring the ones I can to other therapists .  
I ’m in touch with twelve people who work with parahumans and a few who are breaking into that field .  
Not a single one of us is working less than seventy hours a week .  
Some of my patients did n’t need counseling anymore , and I was only helping them to find their equilibrium after Gold Morning .  
Others are on their way to a new facility in this world ’s Europe , which they ’ve been anticipating for over a year now .  
If you were still in the same condition as you were when I first met you , I would be recommending you go there .
” I nodded .  
I did n’t like thinking about it .
“
I could n’t find places for everyone , and I ’d turn down the job before I abandoned patients in need .  
With the remainder , I saw common ground among them .  
Not all of them , but enough of them that it seemed like things could be workable .  
Some supplied , needed , or were looking into the same kinds of assistance , which is what prompted the line of thinking .  
I was going to introduce them regardless , I could see them talking , and I thought it would be best to have the initial and deeper talks in a supervised setting .
”
“
And from there , it was a short jump to thinking about group therapy .
”
“
Yes .  
Group therapy , interpersonal group therapy , seemed appropriate for what I wanted them to address with each of them .  
It meant that in the time before I took on my full - time role with the Wardens , I could devote more time to more of them .  
In an ideal world , if there were some who still needed attention by the time I was done , I could call in favors or find places for them .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .  
“
Was it group therapy like I was a part of ?
”
“
The therapy you were a part of was encounter - driven .  
Different .  
More involved , more simulations , acting and role - playing , confrontation , learning assertiveness as opposed to , say , aggressive behavior , or overly passive behavior .  
Engaging with peers .
”
“ I did n’t really do anything except sit there .
”
“
But you wrote the scripts .  
You listened to the others , and you visualized ways you wanted the conversations to go .  
I got the impression it was pretty intense , even when you were a step removed in your participation .
”
“
Sure , ” I said .  
A large part of what I ’d contributed to those sessions had played into my last interaction with my mom .
Not that that interaction had gone well , but I could imagine that if I ’d found myself in that same situation without the grounding of knowledge from those sessions , I might not have had the words to articulate as much of what I ’d wanted to .  
It was even possible that , without the conflict resolution skills , I might have hurt someone .
The recollections of the therapy and of my mom were heavy , pressing down on me and my chest .  
I took a long sip of my iced tea .  
It was cold and sensory , pulling me away from that rabbit hole of dark thoughts .
“ This group was intended to be slower - paced , less intense , ” she said .
“ Even with the time constraint ?
”
“
Yes , even with .  
Part of it is that , as I said , it was the most appropriate for what I wanted to address .
”
“
Part ?
”
“ The other part ties back to what I said about introductions , how the first meetings are the trickiest .  
It was a delicate balancing act to begin with , compared to your group , where we added someone new once every few weeks or months , while the rest of the group remained fairly stable .  
With this group , having them all meet at once , I thought it would be best to keep things calmer .
”
“ Makes sense , ” I said .
“ My colleagues like to say there is a truism with groups of parahumans .  
That the larger the group in question , the greater the chance of a schism or disaster .  
I ’m not sure I like exactly how the idea is presented a lot of the time it comes up , but
… ”
I thought of my sister .
“
Groups of capes get pretty volatile ,
” I finished the sentence for her .   
“
Each person you add is another chance for things to go wrong .
”
⊙ Three more members joined the group .  
An unknown boy and two people I knew , male and female .
When I realized who I was looking at , though , my jaw dropped .  
I stood from my chair .
She , for her part , was on a similar page .   
She stared at me , confused at first .  
Then reality dawned for her as well .
She was pale in a way that skin did n’t tend to be , and she had a mane of black hair .  
A small black tattoo marked her cheekbone , partially obscured by skin - tone makeup that had streaked in the rain .  
For all that she was almost monochrome from the neck up , she was a riot of color from the neck down .   
Sveta .
Her hands went to her mouth .
She closed the distance between us with a half - stagger , half - run kind of movement .  
I caught a glimpse of her tearing up before she threw her arms around me , colliding with me .  
I caught my bearings and hugged her back .
“
You ’re okay , ” she mumbled into my shoulder .
“
I’m- ”
I started , lost for words .  
I looked at Weld , who stood in the doorway , smiling as wide as I ’d ever seen him smile .
My arms still around her , I reached out with one hand , groping in Weld ’s general direction , as if I could get the words that way .
“ Fantastic , ” Weld said .  
“
This is perfect .
”
He looked a little less neat than he ’d been when I ’d known him in Brockton Bay , but not as wild or ‘ monstrous’ as I ’d seen in the pictures online , back when he ’d been a member of the Irregulars .  
His skin was dark iron , his eyes silver , veins of more silver tracing from the corners of the eyes .  
His hair was wire , made to look more free and unruly .  
He was wearing a henley shirt , khaki shorts and sandals that looked like they were made of metal and what might ’ve been tire rubber .  
I could n’t imagine any other material that would hold up when bearing the weight of someone that was heavy metal from head to toe .
Beside him was a guy , brown - skinned , with the sides and back of his hair cut short .  
The hair on top had to have been painted rather than dyed , because it was magenta , and I could n’t imagine getting black hair dyed magenta without bleaching it to the point of destroying it , and the rolling curls retained their shape despite the droplets of rain that clung to it .  
He was smiling , but more because he looked like the type that very much enjoyed others being happy .  
The magenta - haired guy ’s
shirt was form - fitting to his upper body , showing off lean muscle , and looked like a surfer ’s rash guard .  
He wore black shorts and sandals .
I turned my attention to the girl of the trio .  
I could n’t believe it was Sveta .
Who was practically sobbing now , apparently .
Emotion was welling in my own chest .   
I put my hand on the back of her head , and I felt the hair stir , the tissues beneath the wig moving .
“
Well , I think this has made my everything , ” Weld said .
“
Your everything ?
” the magenta - haired guy asked .
“
Saying it made my day , my week , or even my month would n’t be enough , ” Weld said , still smiling .  
“
You ’re okay , Victoria ?
”
“ Two arms , two legs , ” I said .
“
That ’s great , ” he said .  
“
Sveta was so attached to you , she hated leaving you behind .
”
Sveta nodded , head rubbing against my shoulder .
“
And we ’d thought you ’d died , ” Weld said .  
“ When G.M. happened .  
Hearing you were alive was amazing on its own , but you ’re … you ’re back .  
Fantastic .
”
Sveta made a sound , emotions pouring over , before hiccuping with a sob .
I stroked the back of her head , trusting that someone would tell me not to if it was dangerous .
Then again , I did n’t have my forcefield up .
I could have mentioned it .  
I did n’t .
“
You have a body , ” I whispered .  
I could feel it .  
It was hard , unyielding .  
She creaked in places , and the way she ’d moved-
the colors and textures I ’d seen-
None of that mattered .  
She had a body .
“
It took some doing , ” Weld said .  
“ It took a lot of doing .  
It ’s been a whole adventure to get even this far .  
It ’s not even tinkertech .  
Regular prosthetics and some inventiveness from some really stellar people .  
Arms , legs , body , some stuff to keep it upright , some machine learning systems that adapt to meet her partway , and a lot of practice on her part , to operate everything internal .
”
Sveta pulled away .  
She looked me in the eye , reaching up to wipe at her tears .  
The hands did n’t seem cooperative enough , almost like someone holding a baseball bat by one end was trying to wipe away tears with the other .
I hesitated , before indicating her face .  
“
Do you want a hand ?
”
She nodded , and I wiped the tears away with my fingers .  
She smiled , even as more welled up .
“
You ’re such a sneak , Jessica , ” Weld said .  
“
Not telling us ?
”
“ I did tell you Victoria was recovered .
”
“ I thought you meant she was mobile enough to get to the meeting place on her own .  
I did n’t think you meant a complete and total recovery , ” Weld said .
I wanted to turn to see Mrs. Yamada ’s expression , but it was hard to move with Sveta hugging me .  
She was silent , though .
Behind Weld , someone else was ducking into the room .  
He looked like he was of a height with Kenzie , but given how boys developed slower , he might ’ve been a touch older .  
He had a mess of tousled brown hair that would have been over his eyes if he was n’t wearing large headphones as a kind of hairband .  
He had a very flat expression as he walked around the perimeter of the room .  
His t - shirt was black with a logo I did n’t recognize , his cargo shorts had stuff packed into the pockets , but he mostly looked like a very average kid .  
Only his old fashioned braces really stood out to me- the kind that made it hard for him to put his lips together .
Sveta twisted around , one hand reaching out to me to steady herself .  
She looked over at Kenzie , then at the magenta - haired fellow , and then at the new kid .  
She failed on her first attempt at speaking , then managed .  
“
She was my first friend ever , that I can remember .
”
“
I did n’t know that , ” I murmured .
“
I did n’t have anyone ,
and-
there was a time where I was cooped up in a sealed room in the hospital and stuff was going on outside , with the PRT and the other case fifty - threes .  
They introduced me to people who were harder for me to hurt .  
Victoria was one of them .  
I liked her , and she knew Weld , and she put up with me for some reason ,
so we kept talking and meeting .
”
I leaned closer , whispering in her ear .  
“ For some reason ?  
You helped keep me sane .  
You were my friend .
”
“
Stop it , dummy .  
You ’re going to make me cry more , ” she whispered back .  
“
And I ca n’t believe
I ’m finally hearing your voice for real .
”
And with that last statement she was tearing up more .
“
Since when are you this much of a crier ?
” I asked .
“
I ’m all emotionally open and shit now , ” she whispered .  
“ Blame Weld .  
And blame yourself , being all normal and stuff .
”
“
I ’m
pretty sure I just caught you saying my name just now , ” Weld said .  
“
Maybe that ’s my cue to duck out before you start badmouthing me .
”
“ I ’d never ever badmouth you , ” Sveta said , at normal volume .  
She ’d turned to face him , and I held her arm to steady her as she swayed a bit .  
“
What would I even say ?
”
“ I hear people coming anyway , ” Weld said .  
He stopped , looking at Sveta and me , then smiled wide .  
“
This is fantastic .
”
Sveta hugged my arm .
“
You ’ve said that a lot , ” the Magenta - haired boy said .
“ I ca n’t even begin to tell you , ” Weld said .  
“
In more than one way .  
I ’ll leave it for Victoria to share .
”
“
Maybe we can chat another time , ” the boy said .  
“ We could hang out .
”
“ If Sveta , Victoria , and Jessica
okay
it , ” Weld said , clapping a hand on the guy ’s shoulder .  
“ I do n’t want to throw any wrenches into the therapy or make anything awkward by blurring lines .
”
“ Send me an email if you want to discuss it .  
It ’s always good to see you , Weld , ” Mrs. Yamada said .
“ I ’ll do that , and it ’s good to see you too , Jessica .  
I ’m
sorry
I was n’t able to make the time to sit in .
”
“ Totally understandable .  
Good luck .  
We may run into each other if you stick with the Wardens .
”
“ Excellent , ” Weld said .  
He glanced at us , delivering a wink probably more meant for Sveta than for me .  
“ Fantastic .  
I ’ll text you when I have an idea of what ’s happening with my afternoon , Sveta .
”
“
Good luck , ” Sveta said .
With a parting salute , he was gone .
I took my seat , giving my hand to Sveta , as she collapsed into the chair on the other side of me .  
Now that she was n’t bear - hugging me , I could see that a lot of the color on her was that the prosthetic body she wore had been painted .  
Bumps and collisions had chipped some of the paint , but from the neck down , everything that was n’t covered in clothing was painted in rolling waves , in sea serpents , birds and reptiles .  
The colors were bright and bold , like graffiti , the living things hot orange , the background cool blues and greens .  
Her clothes were relatively plain , a black top and brown pants , and looked to be relatively thick and durable , but the plain - ness was marred by the small streaks and smudges of paint that she ’d gotten on it , most of it in long , thin slashes .
The seating arrangement put me between her and Kenzie .  
Kenzie , for the time being , was leaning over to the new addition to the group , the boy with braces .  
She seemed to be filling him in on what he ’d missed .
“ Tristan , ” the magenta - haired boy said , approaching .  
He extended a hand .  
I shook it .
“ Victoria .
”
“
Will your brother be joining us today ?
” Mrs. Yamada asked .
“ I asked , he did n’t reply , ” Tristan said .
“
Brother ?
” I asked .
“ Twin , ” Tristan said .  
He pointed at his hair .  
“
Part of the reason I make myself so easily identifiable .  
He ’s Byron , he used to have blue - green hair to match me , but he quit doing that .
”
“
Good to know , ” I said .
Blue hair .
I thought of my youngest cousin .
Where Crystal had always had the red - magenta look , Eric had gone with the blue , dying his hair .  
It was a sad , wistful thought .  
With so many losses in recent memory , so much tumult , it felt very distant .  
That distance did n’t make it it feel any less painful .  
If I ’d been burned on an hourly , daily or weekly basis for the last four years , the death of Eric and Uncle Neil would have been the very first time my hand was shoved down and held to the oven ring .
Alarming and hard to process in how devastating and raw it had been , important , but still a very long time ago .
I changed up my focus , “ You all came in together .  
Are you friends ?
”
“ No .   Or kind of ?
” Tristan asked .
“ Kind of , ” Sveta said .
Tristan explained , “ I ran into Weld and Sveta on the way into the first session .  
He dropped her off at the front door because he had a place to be , and I offered my arm .  
Sveta and I geeked out together over Weld .
”
“
He ’s geek - out worthy , ” I said .
Tristan smiled .   
“
Does the impromptu Weld fan club have another member ?
”
“ Nah , ” I said .  
“
No , I ’m just a fan in a very mundane way .  
I think he ’s a good guy .
” Sveta nodded emphatically .
“
At our first meeting , Tristan kept saying he was Weld ’s number one fan , ” Kenzie joined in .
“
Oh , that .  
Do n’t remind me , ” Tristan said .
“ I wo n’t , then , ” Kenzie said , deflating a little .
Tristan sighed , glancing at the rest of the room .  
“
Nah , it ’s no good to leave our guest in the lurch , and I ’m supposed to be holding myself accountable .  
You might as well share , I ’ll take my licks .
”
“
Alright , ” Kenzie said , perking up considerably at the same time Tristan withered .  
“
So Tristan kept saying it , casually mentioning the posters he had before , and he had merchandise .
”
“ Weld figurine , from his stint in the Boston Wards .   
One where he was wearing his first costume , too , ” Tristan said .  
“ I miss that thing .
”
“ I want one , ” Sveta said .  
“
Would it be weird if I had one ?
”
Kenzie continued , “ So he kept saying all that , because he was so psyched he got to meet Weld .  
Then Sveta finally speaks up , and she was very quiet when she said it , but she said ‘ I probably have you beat.’
”
“
I ’m competitive ,
” Tristan said .  
“
So I was pretty adamant that no , no she did n’t .
”
Sveta looked like she was on top of the world , smiling to herself .  
She wiped at her face with one prosthetic hand-
she still had tracks of tears on her face .  
I leaned closer , whispering .  
“ Want a tissue ?
” She nodded .  
I stood from my seat while the conversation continued .
“ …
And she says she ’s his girlfriend , ” Kenzie said .
Tristan sighed .  
“ Yep .
”
“
She ’s living with him , and they sleep in the same bed , and they make each other breakfast , ” Kenzie said .
I liked the mental image .  
I liked that Sveta was smiling as much as she was .
“
It ’s hard to beat that , ” Tristan said .
I collected a tissue from Mrs. Yamada ’s desk , glancing at her .  
She seemed pretty unbothered by this , so far .
“
I do n’t think it ’s about winning , ” Sveta said .
I handed the tissue to Sveta as I retook my seat , and she set about patting her cheeks dry .  
A little bit more of the cover - up makeup came away from the tattoo .
“
Yeahhhh , ” Tristan drew out the word .  
He added ,   “ Easy to say when you ’re the clear winner .
”
“
That ’s fair , ” Sveta said .
“
That ’s a joke , by the way .  
I ’m not being serious here .
”
“
Yeah , ” Sveta said .  
“ I was wondering there .
”
Another person had entered the room .  
A boy , Caucasian , with shoulder - length brown - blond hair .  
He had a cut under one eye and another cut on the bridge of his nose .  
His jeans were ripped at the knee and his shirt was baggy , a size too big for him .  
The sleeves were long , red where the torso was white , and they had been rolled up to the elbow .  
His sneakers had seen a lot of abuse , by the looks of it .  
The white parts were brown and grey in a way that made me suspicious that even a thorough cleaning would n’t get them purely white again .  
He looked sixteen or seventeen .
“
But yeah ,
damn , I do n’t look good enough in a dress , so I have to concede .  
Hey Rain , ” Tristan said .
“
Heya , ” the boy who was apparently called ‘ Rain’ said .  
He took the empty seat next to Tristan .
“
Why are you wearing a dress ?
”
“
Just joking around .
”
There were still two empty seats .  
One would be Jessica ’s .  
There ’d be one more , then .
“
You made it here
okay ?
” Tristan asked .
“
Yeah .   
I got a ride .
”
“
How are things ?
”
Kenzie asked Rain .  
She gestured at her head in a way I did n’t see , with her head blocking my view of the hand on the other side .
Rain seemed to take a second to ponder it .  
He frowned a little .  
“
Not great .
”
“
Better or worse than last week ?
” Kenzie asked .
“
Let ’s save the therapy - relevant stuff for the session , ” Mrs. Yamada interrupted .  
“
Small talk and catching up for now , please .  
We do n’t want to get started before everyone ’s here , and I want to go over ground rules and expectations before we ask anything too personal .
”
Kenzie smiled and shrugged , settling back into her seat , hands in her lap .
“
Alright , ” Rain said .  
He turned his attention to me .  
“
This is the heroine ?
”
“
Ex- , kind of ,
” I said .  
“
But yeah .   Victoria .
”
“ Hi .  
I ’m
Rain .   
Spelled like the water that falls from the sky .
”
“ Cape or civilian name ?
” I asked .
“ I hate that you have to ask .  
Civilian .  
And before you comment on it , yeah , I know .  
It ’s unusual , I ’ve heard the jokes .
”
He ’d said it as if his patience on the subject had run short a long time ago .  
I threw up my hands in mock surrender , my mouth firmly shut .
He said , “ You said ex , but you did n’t sound sure .  
Are you taking a break ?  
Or … ?
”
“
Trying to get back into it after a break , but ended up taking another short break to focus on some background stuff .    
Getting a handle on things .
”
“
Yeah , ” he said , as if I ’d said something very heavy , and he ’d felt part of that weight .  
“
I feel like I ’ve been trying to get a handle on things since I got my powers .
”
“ For a while now , then ?   
If I can ask ? ”
“ Just under a year ago , ” he said .  
“
I think , along with Chris , I ’m the rookie here .
” Post - Gold Morning .  
That helped put things in context .
Chris , too .  
By process of elimination , he ’d be the boy roughly Kenzie ’s age .
“ Family thing .  
You said that once , ” Kenzie said .  
Rain acknowledged that with a nod .
“ Second gen ?
” I asked .  
I wondered if I had any kindred on that front .
“
There are a lot of questions you can ask about the parahuman stuff , ” he said .  
“ When it comes to me , the answer to most of them is ‘ it ’s complicated’ .
”
“
That ’s fair , ” I said .  
“
For a while now I ’ve thought that parahumans should get a membership card , materializing in our hands when we trigger , or arriving in the mail at the first opportunity .  
A warning on one side , ‘ handle with care’ , and then on the other side , ‘ shit is complicated , do n’t ask’ .  
Something that we can flash now and again , like a get out of jail free card .
”
“
Mine would be worn out , both sides , ” Rain said .
“ I could get good mileage out of the ‘ shit is complicated’ side , ” Tristan said .
“ Now I feel left out , ” Kenzie said .  
“ I ’d like to think mine would be nice and neat , stored away as a just - in - case .
”
“
Really ?
” Tristan asked .  
“
Really ?
”
“
Ruh - heally , ” Kenzie said , with exaggerated emphasis and a roll of the eyes .   
Tristan mirrored her pose some .
“ I do like the idea , ” Rain said .  
“ The card .
”
Rain was n’t a smiler , by the looks of it , but he ’d seemed to relax more as I talked to him .
“ By the way , I should have asked , am I allowed to swear ?
”
I asked , twisting around to face Mrs. Yamada .
“
Swearing is fine
In moderation , ” Mrs. Yamada said .  
“
Being here would n’t be nearly as positive if you could n’t say what you wanted to say .  
There ’s a point where swearing takes away from the communication and expression
I ’m
hoping to see , where you hide behind the swearing , or where it ’s disruptive .  
I think you six have a good sense of where that point is .  
I may referee if we get close to it .
”
“
Alright , ” I said .
“ I remember the group therapy session we had back at the hospital , ” Sveta said .
“
Yeah , ” I said .  
Sveta had only been there for the initial sessions .  
She ’d left , I ’d stayed .  
“ Plenty of swearing .  
But it was different , and we did n’t have any kids in the group .
”
“
Well , not young kids , ” Sveta said .
I looked over at Kenzie and Chris .  
“
Will I be overstepping or bothering you if I call you kids ?  
I ’m not sure where the comfort zones are .
” Kenzie snorted .  
“
It ’s fine .
”
“
Nah , ” Chris said , “ Hospital ?  
You were at the Asylum ?
”
He ’d barely hesitated a second .  
He ’d been so quiet up until now , and then the moment I ’d given him an avenue to join the conversation , he went straight from negation to asking questions .
Not pleasant questions either .
“
Oh .  
Sorry , ” Sveta said , to me .  
“ I should have thought you might not want to broadcast it .  
I ’m sorry .  
I kind of brought it up earlier , too .
”
On its own , it was something I could handle most of the time , but it might have been a return to the group therapy session , the presence of Sveta and Mrs. Yamada , even , and possibly the fact that I ’d had a few reminders and it was harder and harder to surface , while it almost felt like Chris was pressing down .
Dark , uncomfortable memories stirred .  
Being paralyzed , silent , the interminable restlessness .  
The way the things on the television and radio had been almost unbearable to see and listen to , not because of the subject matter , but because of my inability to change the channel or shut it off , even though I ’d asked for it to be put on in the first place .
I had to take a second to swallow and remember normal breathing and cadence again , after thinking about it .
“
Let ’s not put too much pressure on Victoria , please , ” Mrs. Yamada said .  
“ I understand that you might feel the need to vet her or figure out if you can trust her , and that makes sense , given the degree of what ’s shared here , but let ’s be fair .  
Let ’s keep the small talk small , I ’ll outline things as we start , and you can decide if you ’re uncomfortable .  
If you are , then we ’ll figure out a way to move forward .
”
“
It ’s okay , ” I said .
“
If you ’re sure .
”
“
It ’s fine , ” I said , glad I was able to find and use a normal tone of voice without any giveaway .  
I turned back to Chris , “ Yeah .  
I was there .   
Arrived midway through twenty - eleven , year and a half , and then the Asylum - supported housing after .
”
“
Right , ” Chris said .  
“ Brockton Bay before that ?
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .  
I wondered for a second at his jumping to the conclusion , before I remembered I had the city and its name on my dress .
“
There was a lot of Brockton Bay in the news , before , ” he observed .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“ Not a lot of it good .
”
I was n’t sure how to approach the conversation with Chris .  
He was hard to read , in fashion , in expression- I ’d glance at his mouth to see if he was smiling or frowning and I ’d only see the braces .  
He ’d been quiet up until now , too , which meant I did n’t have a lot to go on .
Something about him bothered me .  
It was n’t just the slant of his questions or the way it felt like they were pressing at me , but his demeanor , and little things about his appearance I could n’t put my finger on .  
The messiness of his hair was one of those things .  
It looked like he had three cowlicks
– two at either corner of his hairline and one by his temple .   
With his hair pushed back by the headphones he had n’t taken off , they looked a little like small bald patches with the way the hair splayed out from those points .  
He held his hands with his fingers curled in .   
It was offputting in a mild way that lined up with how he came hitting me with those uncomfortable , prying questions and comments .
I wondered if he was one of the ones Mrs. Yamada had been worried about , as part of this group .  
One of the additions that catalyzed something volatile .
That might have been unfair .
“
Weld was there for a lot of it , ” Sveta said , backing me up .  
“ I ’ve heard some of what happened .   
Things got scary .
”
In all fairness , as fond as I was of her , I did find something amusing in how it was Sveta saying that last bit .   
“
Scary ’s a good way to put it .
”
“
But you ’re still wearing the shirt , ” Rain observed .  
“
You ’re attached to the city .
”
“
Sure .  
It ’s my city .  
I grew up there .
”
“
But you admit it was scary ?
”
Rain asked .
“
The city is n’t defined by what happened to it .  
Just like we are n’t the bad experiences that happen to us , ” I said .
“ Are n’t we ?
”
Chris asked , leaning forward in his seat , elbows on his knees .  
“
We ’re the sum of the things that have happened to us , good or bad .
”
“ We are n’t , ” I said , firmly .  
Then , on a moment ’s reflection , I added , “ We ca n’t be .   
There ’s a lot of other things going into it .
”
“ You ’re making me think back to science class , ” Rain said .  
“ I sucked at science .  
What was it ?  
Nature or nurture ?
”
“ Nature versus nurture , yeah , ” Chris said .
“
That ’s it , ” Rain said .  
“ I should have remembered that .  
Are you all about the nature , then ?
”
I thought of my family .  
I ’m not sure that ’s much better .    
Amy had agonized over that one . 
 
“ We ’re getting into territory that ’s close to being therapy again , ” Mrs. Yamada said , rescuing me from the line of thinking .  
“
So I ’m going to interrupt .  
But it ’s a good point to keep in mind for our discussions later today .  
I ’m
keeping an eye on the clock , and we ’re ready to start .
”
Sounds good , I thought .  
I glanced at the empty chairs .
She walked around the perimeter of the room , stopping when she stood behind one of the empty chairs .  
“
Let me recap for our visitor and remind the rest of the group what I said at the start of the first session .  
This particular type of group therapy focuses on self - reflection , effective socializing , supporting each other , helping to problem solve , and examining the patterns we fall into , both the constructive and the problematic .  
Each of you has spent some time with me working on these things , and this is the platform where we put a lot of that into practice .
”
“ My role in this , Victoria , is to be the referee and the coach .  
I ’ll try to ensure everyone gets their turn and has a voice .  
I ’ll try to head off or steer the discussion if it gets into less constructive territory , and to keep things moving if needed .  
I ’ll be chiming in periodically to ensure that confidentiality is stressed .  
I ’ve had Victoria review the same materials I gave the rest of you .
” I nodded .
“ While I can promise you confidentiality on my part , and while I ’ll encourage you all to maintain it , I ca n’t guarantee it .  
If any of you were to pursue villainous activities , the other members of the group could be compelled to testify against you .   
”
The final member of the group entered the room .  
She was somewhere between eighteen and twenty , but her height might have been deceiving .  
Her white hair was long enough to reach the small of her back , her irises especially pale or similarly white , and she wore a black dress with a dozen straps overlapping in an intricate way at the shoulders and back .  
The hem of the dress was damaged at one end .  
Threads frayed , polyester melted , with a noticeable hole in it .
“
Hi , boss , ” Kenzie said , a twinkle of mischief in her eye as Mrs. Yamada gave her a stern look .
“
I ’m glad you could make it , Ashley , ” Mrs. Yamada said .  
“ I ’ve spent the last minute or two going over the basics , reminding others about the aims of the group and how confidentiality works in a group session .
”
“ To fill in our guest ?
” ‘ Ashley’ asked .  
She went straight to the table at the side of the room where a pitcher of water and paper cups were arranged , pouring herself a glass .
“
Yes .  
Her name is Victoria .  
If you ’ll take a seat , I ’ll bring you anything else you need , but I ’d like for everyone to be seated so I can continue .
”
Ashley walked around behind me and circled the perimeter of the group to reach one of the empty seats .  
She swept her hand behind her to brush her dress to one side , so it would n’t bunch up awkwardly beneath her as she took a seat on one of the two chairs between Rain and Chris .
She stared at me .  
Maybe it would have been better to say she stared me down .
I , meanwhile , was left to digest the mistake of Mrs. Yamada
’s that I was here to help address .  
I was ninety - five percent sure I knew who ‘ Ashley’ was when she was in costume , and I was left to take that knowledge and see how it fit together with the issue at hand .
Mrs. Yamada continued , “ Use your own discretion when deciding what to share .  
You ’ve all agreed to participate , knowing the risks and difficulties inherent .  
I ’m hopeful this will be a positive set of exercises .  
I think that more or less sums it up .  
I suspect Victoria ’s presence and the fact you ’ve all had a week to think about what we talked about last session means you ’ll have some questions .
”
“
It ’s pretty late to be bringing her in , ” Ashley said .  
“
Is she joining the group ?
”
“ We had n’t planned on her joining , per se , ” Mrs. Yamada said .  
“ I invited her because she ’s exceptionally well equipped to address the topics that came up last session .
We ’ll build on it and you can decide what you ’re willing to share here .  
During our next and final session , depending on your comfort levels and how much you want to carry on today ’s discussion , she may or may not be in attendance , or not for the full duration .
”
“
Is it really an ‘ issue’ ?
”
Tristan asked , making air quotes .
“ I think it could be .  
Victoria can expand on why , shortly .
”
“
Are we supposed to know who she is ?
”
Ashley asked .
I glanced at Mrs. Yamada .  
She was taking her seat between Ashley and Chris .  
From the gesture in my direction , and the fact that she was n’t stepping in , the ‘ referee’ was leaving the ball in my court .
“
I ’m Victoria Dallon .  
If you study Parahumans , my family comes up , because it ’s a literal textbook case of powers running in families .  
I … believe you ’ve run into my family , Ashley .
”
“
Have I ?  
I ’ve met so many capes
it ’s hard to keep track .
”
“
Do you know New Wave ?
” I asked .  
“
White bodysuits , symbols in colors ?
”
“ I know a few people like that .  
I did n’t always pay attention to names .
” “ Would ’ve been in Boston .  
The slang term in the ‘ scene’ was the Boston Games .
”
Ashley smiled for the first time .
For the rest of the room , I explained , keeping half of an eye on Mrs. Yamada , to make sure I was n’t overstepping .  
“
A series of arrests in Boston saw a shift in the power balance of local gangs .  
That ’s a pretty common thing , but the Protectorate team followed up on it hard , toppling just about every major and most minor gangs and villains in the city , leaving a void that was bigger than usual .  
Villains of every power level and stripe flocked to the city , villains in neighboring cities had a vested interest in having a foothold there as a place to retreat to or a place to expand , and it became an entangled nightmare of villain politics and power plays .
”
“ Time of my life , ” Ashley said .
“ Heroes , like the PRT , and like my family ’s team , followed , to try and keep the peace until things settled .  
My family ’s team was Lady Photon , Manpower , Flashbang , Brandish , Lightstar and Fleur .
”
“ The heroes without masks , ” Ashley said .
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“ I remember them .  
I was one of the villains who flocked , ” Ashley said .
That confirmed that she was Damsel of Distress then .  
B - list villain , chronic headache for the PRT of yesteryear , unpredictable , dangerous , unstable , and fortunately , she ’d been more of a problem for herself than for others .  
She had been recruited by the Slaughterhouse Nine , to pad their numbers , and had died shortly after .
Her history was one of self - sabotage punctuated by events every two or three years where she was cause for alarm .  
She had thrived during the Boston Games , in a sense , enough to get her name out there to capes in Northeastern America as a just in case .
She ’d later found a place in the Nine .  
She was of a particular brand or species of cape , who somehow rose up when everything else was sinking .  
It almost made a degree of sense , then , that in following with that pattern , she ’d risen up from the grave at the same time the entire world was plunged into chaos .
Kenzie was saying something , and I was having trouble tuning in .
Slaughterhouse Nine meant Bonesaw .  
Crawler .  
That in turn led me to think about my last coherent , me moments , the blank in my memories , the aftermath .   
It made me think about actual monsters ,    and the very real possibility that Ashley was one .
“ Were you there ?
”
It took me a second to connect with Ashley ’s question .
“ If you ’re uncomfortable getting into it , we could change the subject , ” Mrs. Yamada said .
“
Could I just get some water , actually ?  
Sorry , you meant Boston , Ashley ?
”
“
Yes .  
During the Boston Games , ” Ashley said , as Mrs. Yamada stood and went to get the water .
“
I was a little too young .  
I followed along back at home , where we made the dining room into a kind of headquarters , putting up a few bulletin boards .  
I colored in the maps and moved pins as the territories changed hands while doing homework and stuff .  
Is it a problem ?
”
“
No , ” Ashley said .
“
What are your thoughts on the subject , Victoria ?
”  
Mrs. Yamada asked , handing me the water .
I drank before answering .
“
It ’s fine .   
Boston was mostly fine , ” I said .  
“ My family did n’t get hurt .  
To me , she was just a pin on the map of Boston we had in the living room-
”
I saw Damsel ’s expression shift .  
A slight narrowing of the eyes .
“ -And
a few interesting and impressive stories my aunt , uncle , and dad brought home .
”
That amended the narrowing .  
Lesson learned .
“
Good , ” Mrs. Yamada said .  
“
I ’m glad to hear that .  
Questions , thoughts , observations ?  
Anyone ?
”
Ashley was n’t done with the questions and comments .  
The words she spoke next were an accusation , and she was very good at sounding accusatory .  
“
You brought her here to change our minds .
” ⊙ Our conversation stalled as a waitress wiped down a table behind Jessica .  
I swished the ice around my now mostly empty glass .
“ I never liked the codenames , ” Jessica said .
“ We might be very different people in that .  
There ’s something fun about them .  
They ’re revealing .
”
“ They are , but they often reveal just how badly the patient wants to escape , to leave their humanity behind and dive into something well beyond humanity .  
Some do n’t surface completely .  
Some hurt others on the way down .  
Some drown in that vast , incomprehensible sea .
”
I drew in a deep breath , then sighed .  
“ Feeling poetic ?
”
“
My own kind of escapism , maybe .  
I think sometimes about a world where all of my patients can go by their real names .
”
“ I ’m not following the train of thought , I ’m afraid .
”
“ I arranged the group therapy .  
I thought for a long time about whether any of my patients were a significant danger to the others , or if they ’d set the therapy of their peers back .  
I took precautions , I pored over the notes , trying to visualize how things might go , or the topics that I could safely broach or go back to .  
Like
I said , the first meetings are hard .
”
“
Yeah .  
I can imagine that .
”
“
And while I do n’t like the way the idea is often interpreted or the conclusions it ’s taken to , there ’s the notion of volatility , and the exponentially increasing chance of trouble as the groups of capes grow larger .   
With parahumans , things are often exaggerated , both in weak points or the hot button issues they have , or their inclination to push certain buttons .   
The more you put in one place , the higher the chance of the wrong button being pushed .  
That was another concern of mine .
” I nodded .  
“ How long has the group been running ?
”
“ Two months and a week , with one or two sessions a week , as situations allow .  
We ’re not quite at the end , but it ’s close .  
This was supposed to be the easy middle stretch .
”
“ Supposed to be ?  
You let your guard down ?
”
“
In a way .  
Maybe from the beginning , ” Jessica said .
She looked genuinely bothered .  
I held my tongue .
She went on , “
I spent so much time anticipating and planning for disaster , that I failed to see the other side of that coin .  
I did n’t want to think of them as capes .  
I sought out the things that would help them connect and find reasons to listen to one another .
”
I realized what had happened .
Jessica was nodding to herself .  
“
That was my mistake .  
We were approaching the end stretch , and I reminded them of the date we would wrap up and finish .  
The conversation took a turn , and I was caught flat - footed .  
They expressed interest in staying together .  
They want to found a team .
”
“ A team of ?
”
“ Heroes , it sounds like .
”
“ Is that so bad ?
” I asked .








“
It ’s not my intent to change your minds , ” I said .   
I could see some skeptical looks on some faces as I looked around the circle .   
“
I ’m here to give another perspective , and maybe to equip you guys with knowledge .   
If you change your minds because of that-
and I think Mrs. Yamada might be hoping for that
, then that ’s fine .   
If not , then I ’d hope you were all going into this with your eyes more open about what you ’re doing .
”
“
I ’ve    addressed my feelings with the group , ” Mrs. Yamada said .   
“
At the end of the session where the topic first came up , and for a portion of the last session .   
We had other things demanding our attention , so we were n’t able to cover it in any depth .
”
“
That would be me , ” Rain said , raising a hand .
Jessica continued , “ To abbreviate what I said then , and to reinforce it in the here and now : if you each carried on as you have been until the final group sessions concluded , then moved on from there with the skills and perspective you ’ve gained , I think most of you would do fine .   
Most of you have reached the points in your journeys where you could continue on your own , without needing the one - on - one therapy or the group sessions .   
You could pursue more conventional therapy , I think anyone could , and you would have my number in case of emergencies or backsliding , but most of you would do fine .
”
“
Ready to be let loose into the urban wilds , ” Chris said .
“ Not all of us though , ” Kenzie said .   
“
You said most , a few times .
”
“
Most , ” Mrs. Yamada said .   
“ I also had private discussions with several members of the group .   
I wo n’t say what was discussed , or with whom , but no , I do n’t think everyone is ready .
”
The group was silent .
I assumed nobody wanted to speak up because they felt like doing so would out them as one of the people who ’d had one of those private conversations .
Mrs. Yamada went on , “ More to the point , beyond any and all of that , I do n’t think the group would necessarily be healthy , taken outside of this setting and function .
”
“ You gathered us together so we could support each other , ” Sveta said .
“ I feel like we do a good job of that .
We bring out the good sides of one another .
”
“
In this setting , yes , I have seen that , ” Jessica said .
“
I ’m
gratified
it ’s been so positive for most of you .
But that ’s in a controlled setting , with a mediator to keep things on course and help recognize the sensitive subjects and steer away from them .
”
“
May I ?
” I asked .
“ Please , ” Mrs. Yamada said .   
“ Feel free .
”
“
To build on what you said , I think the things I ’ve noticed on the those fronts are that , well , it ’s a big leap from the controlled setting of a place like this to the wild , uncontrolled setting of superheroics .
Things will get bad at some point , and when they do , there ’s a tendency for the bad to snowball .
”
“ You lived in Brockton Bay , ” Tristan said .
“
Is it possible
your sense of normal is skewed ?
”
“
That’s- that ’s honestly hard to respond to , ” I said .   
I did n’t miss the flicker of a smile on Tristan
’s face at hearing that .   
“
Because there ’s an answer that springs to mind that I could give you , but I do n’t know where
people ’s limits are , I do n’t want to step on toes or upset anyone by giving an example .
”
“ I do n’t know about the others , but I ca n’t think of what you ’d say that would potentially upset us , ” Tristan said .
“ I can , ” Rain said .
I raised an eyebrow .
Rain leaned forward , elbows on his knees .   
“
I ’m making a pretty big leap here , but it ’s the response that jumped to mind for me , too .   
I ’ve been here from the start , I think I know where everyone ’s at .   
I think it ’s okay to say it , but do you mean Gold Morning ?   
I could see where it would be sensitive , considering just about everyone lost someone , but I do n’t think that ’s going to push anyone in particular over the edge , here .
”
“
Yeah .   
That was it , thank you , ”
I said .   
I looked past Sveta to Tristan .   
“
What happened in Brockton Bay was n’t a break from the pattern .   
It was just the pattern playing out at an accelerated rate .   
What I ’m talking about , the snowballing , the bad things happening and then compounding each other
… they still happened .   
A whole lot of individual factors played into the events of that day , and into the engagements and infighting that followed .
”
“ When they happen more slowly , there ’s time to rest , ” Sveta said .
“ When they happen slowly , there ’s time to get used to the bad , to normalize it .   
You or people you thought you knew change in reaction to those external factors without anyone realizing it and
… things still compound .   
The bad days come , and the unresolved stuff from the last bad days catches up or demands resolution .
”
“ Like Gold Morning , again , ” Rain said .   
“
A lot of things caught up with us around then .   
Or a lot of things converged to bring it about , maybe .   
I was n’t there
so I do n’t know .
”
“
I was only there for the later parts , ” I said .   
“
But I think you ’re right .
”
“
Things are better this time , ” Sveta said .   
“
We ’ve learned from mistakes .   
It ’s a fresh start .   
The Endbringers are dormant , we ’re finally building things without them being torn down all the time .
”
“
I agree with Sveta , ” Tristan said .   
“
I really think there is a lot of work to be done before we get to a good normal , but that ’s where I want to be out there doing some of that work in the best way
I know how , with people I ’ve come to know , like , and respect .
”
“ I do n’t like being on the opposite side of an argument from you , Victoria , ” Sveta said .   
“
It does n’t feel good .
”
I reached out for her hand .   
She met me halfway , putting the prosthetic hand in mine .   
I squeezed it , realized she might not be able to feel the squeeze , and gave it a waggle .   
She smiled .
“
No hard feelings , okay ?
” I said .   
“ I get it .   
You want this .   
Believe me when I say I want to get out and do some heroic stuff too .
”
“ I have a boyfriend I feel like I do n’t deserve , and please do n’t use that as a launchpad to get into another topic , Mrs. Yamada .
”
“
I ’m
keeping my mouth shut for the time being , ” Mrs. Yamada said .
Sveta nodded .   
She looked back at me .   
“
I missed out on most of my teenage years , I do n’t remember my childhood , and I feel so behind .
”
“ I know .   
Believe me , I get it , not to the same degree , but I share some of those same feelings , ” I said .
“ I know you do , ” she said .   
She gave me a waggle back .
“ I think more than a few of us get it , ” Tristan said .   
“
Losing years or losing time because we have to deal with shit
other people do n’t , and falling behind because of it .
” Sveta nodded .   
“
My boyfriend is out and around
and he ’s doing great work .   
He ’s been doing it for a while .   
He tried to build something with the Irregulars and it went bad .   
But now he ’s out there again
and he ’s with the team , the top team I know about , he ’s doing amazing stuff .   
I do n’t know if I can ever catch up , but I do n’t want to not try .   
I do n’t want to let the gap widen .
”
“
It ca n’t be just about him , you know , ” I said .   
“
I think that would be more poison than help for a relationship .
”
“
It ’s not .   
Well , I mean , it is , but it ’s not about him in a him - and - me romantic sense
, it ’s about me
and him-
sorry , I ’m not making sense .
”
“
I ’m following okay , ” I said .
Mrs. Yamada said , “ Just take your time , find the words .
”
“ Back long before I even knew him , he was my reference point for figuring out where we are .   
We being the C - fifty - threes .   
If he was popular then we all had a shot at getting more popularity .   
That was something I could hope I could have one day .   
And I did n’t have a lot of hope , so it was important .
”
I reached over , and gave her arm a solid pat .   
I was still holding her hand .
“
And we spent part of the summer touring other worlds .   
We were looking for our places of birth , but mostly we were looking for mine .   
I ’m one of the only ones who remembers mine .
”
She moved one hand over to tap a finger against her forearm .   
In dark green , almost invisible as a series of dark green images between dark blue sky and dark blue waves , framed by leaping fish in neon orange , were a series of huts .
“ I was waiting for some updates on my body and so we just had me in my hamster ball , and Weld is so great , so patient
…
but I do n’t like being that dependent .   
I want to be self - sufficient and I want to do it by being a hero .
”
“ I think that ’s kind of the opposite of the toxic path , ” Tristan said .   
“
You ’ve talked about it before , Sveta , how you ’re worried about how your world revolves around him .
” Sveta nodded .   
“
When you ’re disabled , and I see myself as disabled , then your world gets smaller .   
Things get harder .   
It ’s easy to become dependent or let down your guard .   
Everything ’s hard and
it ’s really easy to stop trying altogether , to rely on people who want to help , to do what Victoria said and normalize that behavior and let the toxicity seep into things , only to have it come to a head during an already bad day .
”
“
I ’m just going to cut in here ,
” I said .   
“
I one hundred percent think what you ’re saying is cool and good .   
It ’s a good mindset .   
I did catch one thing you said and it made me think .   
You said ‘ self - sufficient’ and one of the things I was thinking about mentioning was , you know , heroing is hard , and it ’s kind of hard in part because it does n’t pay .   
That can lead to self - insufficiency instead .
”
“
It can pay , ” Tristan said .
“ It can , ” I said .   
“
But it paid in part because people wanted to put money toward it .   
Because the governments backed it and put money into the PRT , which paid the heroes a decent wage with opportunities for more .   
I spent my entire life seeing my mom stressing out in front of the computer or in front of the paperwork , from the time I could walk to the time I went to the hospital .
”
“ It can absolutely pay , though , ” Tristan said .   
He glanced at Mrs. Yamada and then said , “ I was a member of a corporate team , I saw and participated in the fundraising and merchandising , and we did well .   
We made a good bit of money .
”
“
Which team ?
” I asked .
“ Reach .
”
“
Oh , kudos .   
I know Reach , ” I said .   
“
I ’m not sure I could list off the roster as of Gold Morning
but I ’m more than passingly familiar .   
Good team .
”
“
Thank you , ” Tristan said .   
“
I mean , I ’m not so worried about the money .   
That ’s the easy part .
”
“ I do n’t think it ’s easy at all , ” I said .   
“
There ’s a saying , um , seventy percent of couples break up because of financial issues .   
The same number of cape teams break up because of the same .
”
“
What ’s so hard about it ?
” Sveta asked .
“
You ’re providing a service , and the fruits of that service are n’t immediately tangible .   
If you do everything right , get crime rates down , clean up the neighborhood , then people look at the clean streets and low crime rate and they wonder why they ’re paying you .   
If the crime rate stays high and things are a mess , then they wonder why they ’re paying you .
”
“
How do you get around that ?
” Chris asked .
“
You show your work , ” I said .   
“
And you show it in a way that makes people believe you ’re doing a good job .   
Bringing in bad guys , getting on the front page , that ’s a big one , but you have to factor in the work of maintaining a relationship with the media , marketing , on top of the work you ’re already doing .   
You can also get into fights the public is aware of , while not putting that public in danger , because putting people in danger means getting sued .
”
“
Which detracts from the finances , ” Chris said .
“
In a big way , ” I said .
“ Like prison rep , ” Ashley said .   
“
Having to show you ’re not to be messed with , without making such a mess that you add to your sentence .
”
“
Yes , ” I said .   
“ Not an analogy I would have jumped to , but
it ’s a good one .
”
“ I was n’t aware you went to prison , ” Sveta said .
“ I did n’t , ” Ashley said , fixing Sveta with a level stare .   
“
I watch tv and read books .
”
I was going to reply to that , but Tristan was already talking .   
He said , “ I ’m not worried about the money side of things .   
P.R. , rep , image , media , I had advice and lessons from masters in the field , when it came to that .
”
“
From what I remember of Reach , I believe you , ” I said .   
“
I do think that there ’s a ton of difference between launching a new team and capitalizing on an established brand like Reach
had , and between being the man in front of the cameras and the person in the background paying the bills .
”
“ I have to ask , ” Ashley said .   
She waited for me to look at her before speaking .   
“
What are your qualifications exactly ?   
You were on a struggling team ?
”
“ I do n’t want to bully Victoria , please , ” Sveta said .
I was feeling the numbers disadvantage , with many things I was saying having two people responding , a number of changes in direction , and the periodic challenging questions .   
Mrs. Yamada had n’t spoken up recently .
“
I ’m a cape geek , ” I said .
“
We ’re all cape geeks , ” Tristan said .   
“
It comes with the territory of being a cape .
”
“
Then I ’m a cape geek of a tier higher ,
” I said .   
“ Listen , my mom and dad were capes
and they were talking shop around me since I was born .   
My aunt , uncle , cousins- my entire immediate and pretty much my whole extended family , they were all capes .   
I was giving interviews about what it was like to grow up with hero parents when I was ten .
”
Tristan cut in , “ Okay , but that doesn’t- ” “ Hold on , ” I said .   
“
I was asked ,
I ’m
answering .   
I triggered at fourteen , I was patrolling within six months .   
I had three years of time as Glory Girl
, one Endbringer fight , and-
” I paused .
Sveta squeezed my hand .
“ -And
one run - in with the Slaughterhouse Nine , followed by almost two years in the hospital .
”
I glanced at Ashley .   
She had n’t flinched at the mention of the Nine .
I went on , “ I ’ve seen some of the worst .   
I had the best boyfriend in the world-
”
“ You had the second best , ” Sveta said .   
“
I ’ll fight you on this .
”
“ I ’ll take you up on that another time , ” I said .   
I smiled .   
“
Some of my family members were some of the most amazing people , one of those family members is still with me , and I count myself lucky in that .   
I was a local celebrity , and I got letters from kids saying they were inspired or I ’d improved their lives by reaching out to them , spending a bit of time with them , or helping them off a bad path through nothing more than me existing .   
With all of that , I think I can say I ’ve experienced some of the best that being a hero has to offer , too .
”
“
What happened to the others ?
”
Kenzie asked .   
“
The other family members ?
”
“ Kenzie , ” Mrs. Yamada said .   
“
It ’s best to leave that be .
”
“
Okay , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I did n’t mean to pry .   
I ’m really sorry , Victoria , for your losses .   
I asked because I ’ve lost people too .   
I know it hurts , and I think you ’re cool
and you do n’t deserve that hurt .
”
“
Thank you , Kenzie .   
I ’ll share , because I think it ’s important for context .   
We ’ve all lost people and that ’s a big part of our shared experience here on Earth Gimel .
”
I saw people throughout the room nodding , or acknowledging that .   
Interesting , to see the lone wolf villainess Ashley nod , too .   
Chris , Tristan , Sveta .   
Mrs. Yamada .
Rain was hard to read , but he looked introspective .
“
My uncle , my cousin , and that awesome boyfriend , Leviathan , twenty - eleven .   
My-
another family member , you could say she got herself .   
Or you could say the team dynamics ,
all that stuff I was talking about before , they played a role .   
I was n’t paying enough attention , I let things pass by without remark when I should have pressed , pressed when I should have held back .   
And now she’s- she ’s not family .   
My mom , recently , just … ” I sighed .
“
I ’m not here to be a downer , ” I said .   
“
I ’m really not .   
I do want to emphasize this is n’t a game .   
There ’s a chance at greatness and there ’s a chance , maybe a higher chance , of disaster .   
I experienced both .
”
“
Not to belittle that , but each and every one of us has gone through shit , ” Tristan said .   
“ If it ’s supposed to be one part of good stuff for every ten parts bad , then I think most of us are owed some good stuff .
”
“
I do n’t think it ’s supposed to be that way , ” I said .   
“ Ashley asked who I am .   
I ’m a cape , born , raised , and learned .   
I ’m a student of capes , I obsessed over them well before I had powers
and I stepped up my game in a professional capacity after I got powers .   
I had date nights with my cape boyfriend where I studied and read his Wards handbook , because that ’s how into it
I was .   
I ’ve followed the trajectories of two hundred cape careers and I ’ve been part of a team trying to get off the ground .   
I looked seriously into what it would take to start a team back when my boyfriend was getting close to leaving the Wards , because I was worried he ’d get moved to another city .
”
I looked Ashley in the eyes .   
“
This is me .   
I know cape stuff .   
I know what goes into it
and I know what comes from it .
”
I looked at Tristan .   
“
The last thing it is , is fair .   
You ’re not owed anything .   
If you roll the dice nine times and get bad results every time , you do n’t have a better shot on the tenth roll because of that .
”
“
But , ” Tristan said , and he said it with a bit of theatrical emphasis and a light in his eyes that made me really believe he had that experience in being in front of cameras and showing off for crowds .   
He was more into things as he continued , “ You have a better shot at getting an optimal result if you roll the dice a lot , than you would if you rolled it a couple of times , get bad results , and quit .   
You have to get back up after you get knocked down .   
You have to .
”
“ Or stand up in the first place , ” Sveta said .
“ Or stand up in the first place ,
yeah ,
” Tristan said .
He glanced at Mrs. Yamada , then back to me .   
“
What you were talking about earlier , with Sveta and it being toxic to not stretch yourself out enough , it applies here .
”
“
I ’m sorry to interrupt , ” Mrs. Yamada said .   
“ Tristan , can I ask why you keep looking to me ?   
It ’s not a usual habit .
”
“
Oh , ” Tristan said .   
“ I barely noticed .   
I think I ’m pretty used to you jumping in to tell me to back down or not get so into an argument .
”
“ I see , ” Mrs. Yamada said .
“ I guess the fact that I ’m
checking means I ’m already aware
I ’m
doing it again , and I should self - moderate .   
Back down on my own instead of being told to .
”
“
Look at that , Pavlov ’s dog can ring his own bell now , ” Chris said .
“
I ’m all about the goats , thank you very much ,
” Tristan said .   
He touched a more pronounced lock of his magenta hair .   
“ See , like the curling horns of a ram , right ?
”
Chris rolled his eyes .
Team Reach and goats ?   
“
You ’re Capricorn ?
” I asked .
“ I am , ” Tristan said .   
“
Bonus point for you .
”
Kenzie , though , piped up with,”I like the hair - horns thing , Tristan .   
I never got it before now
but I think it ’s neat .
”
“
Thank you , Kenzie , ” Tristan said .   
“
This is part of why you ’re awesome .
”
Kenzie ’s expression did n’t change much , but she had one leg crossed over the other , and the free - dangling foot bounced .   
Like a dog wagging its tail .
Chris said , “ Getting an ‘ I like it’ from Kenzie is like getting a participation medal from a school event .   
Everyone gets one .
”
“ That does n’t make it worthless , ” Kenzie said .   
She flashed a smile at Chris .   
“
I never lie , I ’m always honest when I say I like something .   
What makes me different is that I say it instead of keeping it to myself , because I think the world needs more positivity .
”
“ I like it , ” Rain said .   
“
I could never do it , because it takes a weird sort of social courage , but I like it .
”
“
Thank you , ” Kenzie said .
“ I think you lose this round , Chris , ” Tristan said .
“ How do I lose ?   
I was n’t playing .
”
“
And , ” Tristan said .   
Again , that one word , almost a pronouncement , volume and emphasis shifted just a bit to get attention .   
“
On the topic of rounds and games , I feel like Mrs. Yamada is up to something , so I ’m going to play this on a meta level
and I ’m going to shut myself up .   
I recognize I ’ve been trying to win this conversation with Victoria
and I ’ve been monopolizing things by jumping in every time
there ’s an opportunity .   
I ’m supposed to be listening more and trying to ‘ win’ social interactions less , so I ’m going to shut myself up .   
The others should chime in , I trust them to say what needs to be said .
”
“ I ’m proud of you , Tristan , ” Mrs. Yamada said .
Tristan nodded .
Rain said , “ I ’m less proud and more amazed by the fact that your thought process went from ‘ I need to try to win social interactions less’ to ‘ this is a meta - scenario I can win’ in , what , twenty words ?
”
“
What , did I ?
”
“
And the fact he used so many words to say he was going to shut up , ” Chris said .
Tristan frowned at Chris .   
“
You guys are harsh .
”
“
It ’s what we ’re here for , is n’t it ?
” Sveta asked .   
“
We moderate each other .   
Hopefully while not being too harsh on each other .
”
“
It ’s part of it , ” Mrs. Yamada said .   
“
I think the ‘ participation award’ comment was a little much , Chris .   
You have a tendency , which has been remarked on by others in the past , to think a clever put - down is a good thing because it ’s clever , when most people will take away the fact it was a put - down .
”
“
Alright , ” Chris said .   
“
I did n’t think it was a good or bad thing .   
Sorry Kenzie .
”
He did n’t sound very sorry , but Kenzie ’s dangling foot wiggled , and she nodded , wiggling slightly in her seat a bit between the motions .
Mrs. Yamada said , “ The reason I ’ve been somewhat quiet , despite my referee role , is more or less what Tristan intuited .   
I ’ve done this in the past – taking more of a backseat , giving you all more of an opportunity to respond to one another and push back against one another rather than relying on me to keep things under control .   
In the early stages , I had to step in rather quickly .   
I ’m glad that with minimal prompting , Tristan stopped himself before reaching the point where I had to tell him to stop .
”
“ We ’re being toyed with , ” Ashley said .
“
Not that , ” Mrs. Yamada said .   
“
The end goal is to get you all ready for the real world .   
Early on , the rudder needed a firm hand ; as time goes on , I ’m periodically hands off , seeing how you interact , until I see that you ’re faring reasonably well on your own .   
It ’s a gradual process that requires I give you more and more trust .   
Okay ?
” Ashley nodded .
“ It might be worth pausing to take stock in this moment .   
Snapshot the feelings and thoughts you ’re experiencing .   
Some of you have n’t spoken up much at all .   
Depending on how you view the conversation , your participation or nonparticipation , some of you might be feeling frustrated , offended , worried , or even guilty .
”
“
Is that last one aimed at me ?
” Tristan asked .   
“
Oh , wait , sorry ,
I ’m supposed to have shut up .
”
“
It ’s not aimed at you , Tristan , ” Mrs. Yamada said .   
“
I want each of you to think about where you stand right now .   
What are your feelings and where is your focus ?   
Have you felt like you ’ve had a voice or that you ’ve taken things in a positive direction ?   
Outside of the classroom , in a stressful situation with high stakes , these feelings could be magnified manifold .   
As Victoria suggested when she was talking about the slow progression of background negativity , the bad feelings are n’t always resolved or solved , and it would be very easy for a sliver of frustration to carry forward , nettling at you or being joined by other , similar feelings , until you felt compelled to do or say something you regret .
”
“
Handing that irritation off to someone else , ” I said .
“
Yes , ” Mrs. Yamada said .   
“
And , as a final comment on the topic from me , I brought Victoria here for several reasons .   
One of them is that I do believe she knows what she ’s talking about .   
Another is that , from my position as a person with a measure of trust and power , with a strong feeling about what you ’re committed to doing , it ’s very difficult for me to both argue the points and also manage the discussion at the same time .   
If I tell Tristan to give others a chance to speak , it could be seen as me trying to shut down his side of the argument .
”
“
I ’m here as a bit of a surrogate ,
” I said .   
“
I ’m
here saying what you ca n’t .
”
“
In part .   
I think we do disagree on some things .
”
“ Like the value and importance we place in cape names , to quote a recent example , ” I said .   
“
I like them , you do n’t .
”
“
Yes .   
I did , for the record , let Victoria know I would be sitting back more than usual .
”
“ You did .   
I did n’t expect to be ganged up on , though .
”
“ I ’m sorry about that .
”
“
It was mild , ” I said .
“ I do n’t want to gang up on Victoria .   
I ’ve done a lot of talking too , ” Sveta said .   
“
But I think that ’s because I know Victoria , even if this is our first time really talking properly .   
There ’s a bit of trust .
” I nodded .   
“ Yep .
”
“ For what it ’s worth , ” Sveta said , “ that trust means that much like Mrs. Yamada I do believe Victoria when she says she ’s worried or she thinks this could go badly .   
I know she knows stuff .   
But I do want this .   
I want to stand on my own two feet .   
Sorry .   
I think the ones who ’ve been quiet up until now should say stuff .   
Ashley , Chris , Kenzie , Rain .   
Or , you know , maybe Victoria has more to say .
”
“
Thank you for coming , by the way , Victoria , ” Kenzie said .
“
You ’re welcome , ” I said .   
“
I do want this to be a chance to share what I know and for you guys to gain , if that ’s possible .   
Maybe there are places where you might realize there are gaps in your knowledge that you could then take time to brush up on .   
There is n’t a rush .
”
“ There is , kind of , ” Rain said .
Heads turned .
“ I talked about this last session .   
There ’s currently some people after me .   
I want to be part of a team because it ’s backup .   
Having a squad of people with me when I ’m out and about would throw a wrench into their plans .   
It could give me a fighting chance when I would n’t have one otherwise .
”
“ People are after you ?
” I asked .
Rain held up his fingers in a way that made a rectangle .   
“
It ’s complicated .
”
The rectangle was supposed to represent the card .
I smiled despite myself .   
“
And these guys are okay with taking the risk involved there ?
”
“
I ’m not scared , ” Ashley said .
“
I ’m breaking my vow of silence again , ” Tristan said , “
But I think
I ’m
doing it for the right reasons here .   
I like , respect , and/or trust each of these guys who would be my teammates .   
But in particular , I consider Rain a friend .   
I ’m already willing to throw my helmet into the ring and do what it takes to help save his life .   
We ’ve got some similar garbage going on with … people we ca n’t get away from , and he ’s had my back in the past when it came to my issue .
”
“
Yes , ” Rain said .   
He gestured vaguely toward his head .
“
People ?
” I asked .
“
Speaking for myself , I ’m part of a multitrigger cluster , ” Rain said .
“
Oh , ” I said .   
I paused , taking stock of that .   
“
I can see where that warrants playing the ‘ complicated’ card .
”
Kenzie spoke up , “ Before you got in , Ashley , Victoria was saying we should all get a card saying ‘ it ’s complicated’ on the one side , and ‘ handle with care’ on the other .   
I wanted to make sure you got what they were talking about .
”
“ I like that , ” Ashley said .   
“ It could use rewording .   
‘ Do not fuck with’ , instead of handling with care .
”
“ Reminds me of the old wiki entries , ” Capricorn said , “ The red warning boxes for the scary capes .
”
“
Did I have one ?
”
Ashley asked .
“ You did , ” I said .
Ashley nodded .   
“
Good .
”
Was it ?   
I decided to leave it alone .
“ You were motioning toward your head before , ” I said , to Rain .   
“
Are you referring to bleed - over , kiss and kill ?   
That sort of thing ?
”
“ Huh , ” Rain said .   
“
You were n’t lying when you were saying you ’d studied up .
”
I ’d pulled my hand away from Sveta
’s at one point , and I only realized it because she reached out and took my hand again , placing her hand over mine and giving it a congratulatory squeeze .
“
Is it part of it ?
” I asked .
“ I do n’t know , honest to God , ” Rain said .   
“
When I ’m vague and
I ’m saying it ’s complicated
, it ’s really because I ca n’t give a one hundred percent clear answer .   
I ’m still figuring out the rules this works by .   
I ’ve wondered about the bleeding through .   
My personality changed after , but I do n’t know how much of that is them and
how much is how a trigger event is a wake - up call .
”
“ We like to give things hard labels , but sometimes they ’re blurry around the edges , ” I said .
Rain nodded .
“ If your own cluster is coming after you , I ’d say you could chalk it up to kiss and kill .   
Again , blurry , might as well throw it in that bucket .
”
“ I wo n’t object , ” Rain said .
“
And while I ’m on that subject , I ’d feel compelled to stress that the term uses the word ‘ kill’ for a reason .
”
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .
“ People die .   
Friends of people die .   
I ’m still figuring out what you guys are doing , but … you want to bring kids into that ?
” I asked .   
I looked over to my right , at Kenzie and Chris .
“ Definitely not , ” Rain said .   
“ Tristan is saying he ’d help , Ashley is offering a hand , and Sveta might do what she can ?   
That ’s a hell of a lot better , compared to the same circumstance with me alone .
”
“
There ’s more peace of mind in talking to legitimate authorities , ” I said .
“ There is , ” Rain said .   
“ If things get bad , I ’ll go to them .   
I ’ve tested the waters and asked questions .   
It does n’t seem like they ’ll offer help against a nebulous threat with an unclear window of time where it might occur , and villains    I do n’t know the names , locations or details of .   
It ’s more like they want me to call them when I ’ve got a claw at my throat .
”
“ Everyone ’s busy , ” Tristan said .
“ Claw ?
” I asked .   
“ Tinker claw ?
”
That got the room
’s attention .
“
You ’re thinking of the man with the tinker arms you ran into at the community center , Victoria ?
” Mrs. Yamada asked .
“
Yeah , ” I said .
She explained , “ Victoria mentioned that she took him for a multi - trigger , given the powers he displayed and the common links to a woman with claws she ’d read about .   
I was going to bring it up at the end of the session , to avoid the lengthy digression like we had last session , and I hoped to extend it to a discussion in another venue , possibly with less people .
”
“ I derailed us early , it seems , ” I said .
“ You ran into a member of my cluster ?
”
Rain asked .
“ Big guy , beard , heavy coat .
”
“ Long hair , hood , rough voice , ” Rain said , “ And a glare , like if looks could kill .
”
“
No hood , glare … I do n’t know .   
He wore a mask with a built in glare , but he seemed like the scowly type .   
Definitely on the voice .
”
“
Of course , ” Rain said .   
“
When did you fight him ?
”
“
When ?
” I asked .   
“
Um .   
Thirteen days ago .   
First Monday of September .   
High school had just started .
”
Rain held up one hand , counting on his fingers , his lips moving .
“
Why ?
” I asked .
“ Timing matters .
”   
It was Tristan who had replied , while Rain was busy counting .
“
He was strong then , ” Rain said , finishing his counting and dropping his hands .
“
He was a bit of a bastard , if I ’m being honest , ” I said .   
“
Not fun to go up against .   
He ’s one of the ones who was after you ?
” Rain nodded .
“ Why the counting ?
”
“ It ’s complicated , ” Rain said .   
He must have seen the look on my face , because he added , “ The powers wax , wane , and shuffle around .   
I try to keep track .   
He was loaded to bear on that day , if I ’m remembering right .   
The only power he did n’t have a lot of was mine , and maybe a little bit less of his own .
”
“
Right , ” I said .   
“
Which is yours ?
”
“
Uh .   
Mine is a blaster power , ” Rain said .   
“
It ’s pretty mediocre .   
I shoot things or people and they ’re vulnerable to being broken for a short while after .   
To put it simply .
”
“
Mediocre is sort of the name of the game when it comes to clusters , ” I said .
“ I ’ve got a tinker power , I make extra arms and hands .   
They ’re not very good .   
Barely above what I ’d be able to make on my own , fragile enough that if you grab something wrong they can break , no strength , ugly .   
The prosthetic focus is part of why I was introduced to the group , I think .
”
“
It was , ” Mrs. Yamada said .   
“
We thought there was a chance of insights across designs .
”
Sveta would be one , obviously .   
Ashley raised a hand , slender , with black - painted nails .
I could n’t tell that her hand was prosthetic .
“ I was n’t much help , because I ’m a really bad tinker , ”    Rain said .   
“
I can also catch my balance or secure my footing more easily , that ’s my version of the big guy ’s mover power .   
It ’s handy in a way , lets me turn on a dime or keep from falling over .
”
“
Wait , his power was the mover power ?   
The arms and emotion power were his secondaries ?
” I asked .
“
That ’s
what I ’m
saying , ”
Rain said .   
“
I think he had a bit less of his own power that day , with the way it was sorted .   
My last power is an emotion power .   
Guilt and doubt , over an area .   
It ’s pretty tepid .
”
“
He hit me with it a few times , ” Tristan said .   
“
Tepid is a good word for it .   
You can actually not notice you ’re being hit by it .
”
“
And it waxes and wanes , you said ?
” I asked .
“
My blaster power can get a bump some days .   
My others , no .   
They stay at about that power level .   
The others change it up more , they ’ll act on days they ’re strong .
”
“ We may be getting distracted , ” Mrs. Yamada said .   
“ I might suggest you carry on this discussion later .   
Victoria can fill you in on …
”
“ Snag , ” I said .   
“
Sorry .   
This is actually really interesting though .   
I ’d be happy to talk it over another time .
”
“
It ’s good to have a name for him , ” Rain said .   
“
Uh , okay .   
Getting back on topic , I know I ’m a little selfish in why I ’m doing this .   
Wanting people to have my back .
”
“ We all need people to have our backs , ” Kenzie said .
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .   
“
It ’s still selfish .   
It ’s messy and
I ’m not sure I can pull my own weight with all of this .   
I do want to help people though .   
I ’ve been selfish for a long time .   
I ’m trying to be better .   
I know
I ’m
contradicting myself in what I ’m doing here , but it makes sense to me , and so few things do .
”
“
You said-
” Kenzie started .   
“
Oh , are you done , Rain ?
”
“ I ’m done .   
Pretty much where I ’m at .   
I ’ll buy you a coffee or whatever you drink , Victoria , if you ’ll tell me about Snag . ”
“
Sure .
”
“
You said you had info about hero teams , Victoria , ” Kenzie said .   
“
And I ’m interested in that because I do want to try to be a hero first .
”
“
First ?
” I asked .
“
I ’m saying I ’ll try , maybe a few times , and if it does n’t work out I ’ll try other things but if it does n’t work out then I might try being a mercenary , or a villain .
”
“ You would be terrifying as shit if you were a villain , ” Chris said .
“
Would I ?   
Is that a compliment ?
” Kenzie asked .
“
Yes , ” Ashley said .
“
No , ” Chris said .   
“
It ’s a neutral fact , and I do n’t use the word terrifying lightly .
”
“ Be fair , Chris , ” Mrs. Yamada said .
“
I ’m being fair .   
This is an objective fact , ” Chris said .
“ And be gentle , too .   
If you must levy a criticism- ”
“
Fact .
”
“ -there are nicer ways to say it .
”
“
Got it , ” Chris said .
Kenzie stuck out her tongue at him .
“
Terrifying is good , ” Ashley said .   
“ Terrifying slows the other guy down .   
It makes them make mistakes .
”
“
You ’re not wrong , ” I said .   
“
I ’ve used that to my advantage- ”
“
And it ’s fun , ” Ashley said .
“
Ah …
I used to think that , ” I said .   
“ I ’ve come to reconsider that sentiment .   
I regret how I employed it , a little , and I regret enjoying it a lot .
”
Ashley sighed a little .
“ We ’ve talked about this at some length , ” Mrs. Yamada said .   
“
Here in the group .   
The approaches that work .   
Fear comes at a cost .
”
“ It does , ” I said .   
“ Not necessarily in the ways you ’d expect , pushing people away or any of that .   
It makes a mess .   
It makes people unpredictable .   
I have an awe - fear aura
so I ’ve seen this at work .
”
“
I almost envy you , ” Ashley said .   
“
To have something you can so casually employ .
”
“
It ’s not casual , ” I said .   
“
Because like I said , it ’s complicated in terms of the mess it makes of things .   
I ’ve been trying to be more deliberate about how I use it .
”
“
See , this excites me , ” Kenzie said .   
“ I want to learn from Ashley because I saw the camcorder footage from the Boston Games-
I showed you that one right , Ashley ?
”
“ You did , ” Ashley said .
“ I ’ll get you a copy because you liked it so much .   
There ’s also a video I do n’t think I ’ve shown you
but it ’s mostly
you walking through a club with someone and everyone gets out of your way .   
That was interesting .
”
“
Do you want people to get out of your way , Kenzie ?
” Sveta asked .   
“
I do n’t think it ’s good or fun .
”
“ Definitely no .   
It ’s still interesting .   
But , um , I also want to learn from Victoria because I do want to be on a team , I want to be on this team of course , but whatever happens I want to be on some team .   
Then I want to be useful
so I stay there .   
The more
I know the more useful I can be .
”
“ I am interested in hearing it too , ” Sveta said .   
“
About teams , making heroics work .
”
“ I looked over my schoolwork and some old projects before I came today , ” I said .   
“
I typed up some bullet points and thought hard about what I wanted to say , and … being here , I ’m not sure it ’s valid .
”
“
It ’s valid .   
I want to hear it , ” Kenzie said .
“ I would too , ” Ashley said .   
“
It ’s why I ’m here .
”
I was caught a little off guard by that .
I could remember Ashley ’s comments when the topic of the cards had come up .   
She ’d liked the ‘ handle with care’ aspect of it , which was illuminating in its own way .   
More specifically , she ’d liked it while interpreting it as a ‘ do not fuck with’ license .
The way it had been framed and what I knew of Ashley and Damsel of Distress made me imagine it as a ‘ warning : volatile’ label on her breast , worn much like a nametag .
She ’d reacted to me belittling her even in a small way , earlier , when I ’d reduced her to a pin on a map .
“ It might be worth saying why you think it is n’t valid , ” Mrs. Yamada suggested .
I tried to find the words to articulate what I wanted to say without getting on anyone
’s bad side , my fingers twirling a lock of hair while I looked down at the floor .   
I looked up and looked her in the eyes , then looked at everyone else as I said , “ I can come here and I can say , alright , finances .   
Being a hero team is tough financially .   
I touched on this before .   
How do you get funding , one source , many , or is it institutional ?   
What ’s your budget , what can you expect to pay , where are the hidden costs , like medical or needing a headquarters , and what are the potential costs or risks if you decide to save money by trimming the budget somewhere ?   
And maybe that angle works for some of you .
”
“
It feels abstract , ” Sveta said .   
“
I have a stipend , I pay rent , I have to budget , but when you talk about things in the big picture like that , I find it hard to imagine .
”
“ Budgets and money make more sense when you root them in tangible things that are relevant to you .   
If you had questions about one area , I might have more to say about it , or I could expand on the idea , if that was a thing that worked for you guys , as a way to wrap your head around what you ’re trying to do .   
I could do the same for objectives and goals , information gathering , costumes and presentation , allegiances and direction , liaisons , territories , methodology … one or two others
I ’m not remembering off the top of my head .   
But as far as I can tell , you ’re approaching this from several different directions , with very different priorities .
”
“ We definitely are , ” Rain said .
“ I do n’t get the impression Ashley is prioritizing developing herself as a person , becoming independent , or catching up in life , like Sveta is .   
I do n’t get the impression its about becoming less selfish or wanting or needing backup , like Rain .   
I ’m not sure what someone of your pedigree would be doing here , Ashley .
”
“
Pedigree ? ”
Ashley asked .
“
It means aristocratic background when used to describe humans , ” Chris said .   
“
She ’s not calling you a bred animal .   
I ’m pretty sure .
”
“ I ’m not bothered .   
I like the word choice , ” Ashley said .   
She had half of a smile on her face .
“
It was picked to be liked , ” I said .
“
I ’m here to learn , Victoria ,
” Ashley said .   
Her gaze with the narrow pupils and lack of irises was intense .
“
That ’s positive , ” I said .
“
No it ’s not , ” Chris said .
“
I ’m here to learn how heroes operate ,
so I can be more effective against them when I return to being a villain , ” Ashley said .
I looked at Sveta and Tristan , then at Mrs. Yamada .
“
She ’s not lying , ” Tristan said .
“
It ’s positive , really , ” Sveta said .   
“
She ’s agreed to stick with us until we crash and burn .
”
“ Until you fail , ” Ashley said .
“ Until we crash and burn , ” Sveta said .   
“
We went over this .   
If you leave at the first sign of failure then you ’ll be gone in the first week and you wo n’t have learned anything , and everyone loses .
”
“
Irritating , ” Ashley said .
“ Reality is irritating , ” Rain said .
“
We ’re low - key confident we can get her to stick around on the side of the good guys , with sufficient friendship , ass - kicking of our opponents , and time to convince her of the upsides , ” Tristan said , to me .
“
You vastly underestimate how much I enjoy being a villain , Tristan .
”
“ You enjoy being a villain
but you do n’t like the life that comes with it , ” Rain said .
“
It had its merits , ” Ashley said .
“
Sure , ” Rain said .   
“ And a lot of other misery besides that .
” Ashley sighed .   
“ I ’ve already agreed .   
I ’ll join you .   
I ’ll defend you from your cluster .   
In exchange I learn about heroes , I get information about the cape scene , and I may get training .   
If it fails , I ’ll go back to what I know and enjoy .   
You ’ll have your chance to convince me that being a hero is great .   
I doubt you ’ll succeed .   
Most heroes I ’ve met have been imbeciles and nuisances .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .   
I put a hand to my forehead , closing my eyes .   
Capes were so damn weird sometimes .
“
You said it was better than the alternative , before everyone arrived , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Being a hero .
”
“ I did , ” I said .   
I might be regretting saying that now .   
The fact that Kenzie paid attention to what I ’d said and was quick enough to bring out the salient points was good , objectively , but it was kind of a pain here .   
I could see where some of Mrs. Yamada ’s worries were rooted , here .   
“
You have a strong drive to learn , then , Ashley ?
”
“ What I want has n’t changed .   
I want to be on top .   
I want to destroy my enemies and give potential enemies a reason to fear me .   
I ’m going to do it right this time .
”
This time .   
There were four different things I wanted to reply to there , and I settled on the easy one .   
“
Reports were that you died .
”
“ I did , ” she said .   
“
Now I ’m back .   
My power is n’t holding me back anymore .
”
“ You get sparky sometimes , ” Kenzie said .
“
So long as my hands are maintained , I ’m fine .   
I have contacts .   
I ’m eating well ,
I ’m sleeping
, I ’m studying
and I ’m training .   
I ’ll do it right this time .   
I wo n’t die this time .
”
“
Alright , ” I said .   
“
That pretty much sums up what I ’m trying to say here .   
You guys have your reasons .   
I ca n’t show you a spreadsheet or make a list that meets your needs because your needs are diverse .   
It ’s not about hard stats like dollars and viewership .
”
“
It ’s about dollars for me , ” Tristan said .
“
Right .   
I ’ll note you do have a very different idea than I do about how much money there may be ,
” I said .
“ Kind of , ” Tristan said .   
“
I do n’t know if it ’s that different .
”
The thing I wanted to say that I could n’t without offending people was that a lot of them were coming at things from an irrational or emotional perspective , from their self , and not from logic .   
To challenge Sveta ’s approach on this was to challenge the woman she wanted to be .   
Challenging
Rain meant putting his mortality at risk .   
Damsel was too volatile to push too hard , she had her motivations , and I could n’t imagine scaring her off would do any good to anyone .   
The team would go forward without her , dejected and possibly upset with me or with Mrs. Yamada for inviting me .
My impression was that Tristan was looking at the money from an abstract , emotional perspective as well .
“ I barely have a high school education , it ’s not
like there ’s a lot out there for me , and money is tight everywhere , ” Tristan said .   
“
I like the hero stuff .   
I like the notoriety , and I like being out there .   
We need a fix , and the two ways I see of us getting one would be if we get the money together to pay the right cape , or we chance into meeting the right cape .
”
“
Fix ?
” I asked .   
“
Sorry , I missed something .
”
“
With how quick you were about cape terms and names , and how you knew Reach
, I thought you might have realized .
”
“
I figured out you ’re Capricorn .
”
“
More to it than that .   
You know how two brothers can get in a pissy fight over who gets to have the remote and decide what to watch on TV ?   
We ’re stuck doing that , except it ’s way more fucking intense .
”
Two brothers and one power ?   
Or-
Oh , I was an idiot .
“
That we are , ” Tristan said .
We .   
“
You ’re a case seventy ?
”
“
I ca n’t tell you how bummed I am that it is n’t case sixty - nine instead , but no , that number went to a bigfoot sighting or something stupid .   
A stupid bit of immature humor would ’ve been the one good thing in this mess of a thing .
”
“ Case seventies in North America included Knot , Tandem , Zigzag was one , I think , there was House of Three in Quebec .   
And … you , it seems .
”
“
One or two of them might not be seventies , but they get called seventies because they ’re close enough .   
Blurred lines , like you said .   
When twins trigger , the powers are identical or nearly identical .   
When twins trigger and they ’re touching one another , like you said to Rain , things get blurry , the agent is too stupid or careless to tell where one starts and the other ends , or it wants to fuck with us , and it jams everything in together .   
Two minds , two similar powers , and one body to be shared .
”
“
Is he asleep ?
” I asked .
“
No .   
He ’s in here , he ’s watching and listening .   
He sleeps when I sleep , or I sleep when he sleeps , if he ’s in the driver ’s seat .   
We trade out for two hour shifts .
”
“
Can he communicate ?
” I asked .   
“
Talk to you while it ’s your turn ?
”
“ That would be too easy , ” Tristan said .   
His good humor was gone now .   
He just looked sad .   
“
No . ”
No .
Two brothers , and only one of them could be interacting with the world at a time .   
For the other , it was- picturing it made me think of being in the hospital again .   
Being stuck , immobile , locked in while the world went on around them .
Oppressive , that kind of thinking .   
Just as oppressive to be living it .
“ I like Byron , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I really wish he would stay for the therapy sessions .
”
“
I like him too ,
” Rain said .   
He leaned back in his chair , hands at his hair , pushing it away from his face as he stretched .   
“ I do n’t like talking about you like
you ’re not here , Byron .   
We ’ll hang out later ,
okay ?   
Unwind .
”
“
It ’s been a long and rocky road , ” Tristan said , to me .   
“
He ’s not interested in the hero thing either .   
He ’s on Mrs. Yamada
’s side here .   
On yours , kind of , Victoria .
”
On my side ?   
I was trying to frame my argument , but it was an uphill battle for logic to win against the heart , and it did seem like their hearts were in this , to varying degrees .
I decided to say as much .
“
I might not be winning any points with Mrs. Yamada in this , ” I said .   
“
And I do n’t know enough about your individual situations , but you have personal , thought out reasons for wanting to do this .   
At this stage , I ’m not telling you guys you should n’t do this .   
I ’m
definitely , definitely not saying you should .   
I think there are a few things to work out .   
I ’m
honestly really concerned about Ashley .
”
“ As anyone should be , ” Ashley said .
“ That would be why I ’m concerned .   
I do n’t know if you guys want to sit down as a group at a cafe or something , hammer out some basic plans .   
You ’d probably want something like an outline or playbook that you can take with you when you ’re talking to the Wardens or whoever ’s managing the territory closest to you .   
I think the hero teams are covering different sections of the city , and you would n’t want to step on jurisdictional toes .   
If you want to do this .
”
“ That could be great , ” Sveta said .
Kenzie nodded , very enthusiastically , as in most things .
“ Chris and Kenzie , ” Mrs. Yamada said .   
“ You ’ve been quiet .
”
“ I ’ve talked about wanting to pick Victoria ’s brain and she listed some topics , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I like this whole conversation as a recap , seeing where everyone ’s at , instead of trying to think back to previous sessions and think about what people ’s reasons are .   
I ’m glad we ’re talking like this
and I want to have that meeting and figure things out .
”
“ Chris ?
”   
Mrs. Yamada prodded .
“
Can I just say I do n’t want to share with the guest here ?
”
“ You can , ” Mrs. Yamada said .   
“ Is it the truth ?
” Chris looked annoyed as he looked at her .   
“ I do n’t like talking about stuff .   
Digging into my thoughts for answers stresses me out and throws me more out of whack than it helps .
”
“
You ca n’t exist purely on the surface level , ” Mrs. Yamada said .
“ I can .   
It might or might not be good for me , but something that could be good or could be bad is a lot better than no - win after no - win .
”
“
No win ?
” I asked .
“
I could say it ’s none of your business , ” Chris said .
“ You could , ” I said .   
“
It ’s your right .
”
“ I do n’t see why you ’re as defensive as you are , ” Sveta said .
“
I ’m playing defense because paranoia is the only way to survive , ” Chris said .   
He reached up to adjust his headphones , wincing mid - adjustment .   
“
How many sessions did it take before I gave you all the basics ?
”
“ Four or five , ” Kenzie said .
“
Well , this is session one with the new person , ” Chris said .   
“ If you want to drop me from the team because I ’m not
okay with that , fine .   
I ’ll figure something else out .
”
“
Nobody is saying that , ” Sveta said .   
“
You ’ve come this far with us , do n’t get shy now .
”
“ I ’m not shy , I ’m suspicious .   
That wo n’t change , ” Chris said .   
He sounded irritated , in a way his expression did n’t convey effectively .
“
Okay , ” Mrs. Yamada said .   
“ I do n’t think pressuring Chris will help anything .   
Again , however , I would really urge everyone present to periodically take stock .   
Pay attention to what you ’re feeling , imagine this dialogue extrapolated out to a greater , higher - stakes situation .   
How will you handle your feelings , and will you feel have both a voice and the ability to affect the changes you need ?
”
“
You ’re worried we ’ll get railroaded , ” Rain said .
“
I ’m worried about a number of things , Rain .   
I wish you would be willing to put things off for six months or a year , maintain contact , see how you get along as simple friends and acquaintances , let the ties solidify or break as they will , and then move forward if it is what you still want .
”
“
There are a lot of issues to hammer out , ” I said .   
“
You ’re coming at this from so many different directions
… how do you even get started in terms of the kind of team you end up being ?   
In other things ?   
I ’d join my voice to Mrs. Yamada ’s and urge you to take your time .
”
“
Like I said , I ’m feeling the pressure , ” Rain said .   
“
My cluster is homing in on me .
”
“
I can talk to people , if you want .   
If you need another cape to back you up , I might be able to help .
”
“
I mean , that sounds nice , ” Rain said .   
“
But I ca n’t help but lie in bed some mornings , wondering if this is the day .   
If , in the next twenty - four hours , the other three members of my cluster come after me in an organized way , with a lot of money and a lot of resources poured into things .   
When I see it playing out in my head , I know they ’re organized , and I worry we ’re not .   
If we ’re part of a team , if we ’re training , coordinating , then maybe we can work together in an organized way too .
”
“
There ’s a lot that goes into making a team .   
You can stay together and watch Rain ’s back , meet , talk , and plan .
”
“ Without getting the practice in ?
” Tristan asked .   
“
Sorry to butt in again , but it takes time to learn how to work with teammates .   
Some more than    others .
”
“ What you ’re wanting to do on the heroism front is hard enough without added complications .   
It ’s a bad , bad climate for heroes to try to get started .   
That could end up being more distraction than the training is a boon .
”
“ Imagine how bad the climate would be if nobody new got started , ” Tristan said .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
I wo n’t deny that .   
I just-
I have serious reservations , but I also recognize I probably wo n’t be changing any minds .   
Instead of trying to get you to reverse course or stop , I ’m saying maybe change trajectories a bit .   
Go slow , focus on what needs to be focused on , instead of getting distracted with the many , many side things that go into getting a proper team started .
”
“ Focusing on keeping Rain safe , as the priority thing ?
” Sveta asked .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
I can meet you guys at a coffee shop or somewhere , we can make it a regular thing .   
I can back you up , I might be able to introduce you to people , and we do what Mrs. Yamada suggested , and take months or a year to get a really good game plan put together .
”
“
You ’re committing to a lot , Victoria , ” Mrs. Yamada said .   
“
It wo n’t conflict with your other plans ?
”
“ I like doing this sort of thing .   
I ’ll find a way to work it in .   
It gives me an opportunity to stay in touch with Sveta , too .
” I was elbowed , hard , from my left .
“
If you think I ’m letting you drift away or lose touch now
then you need a reality check , ” Sveta said .
“ Was n’t planning on it , do n’t worry , ” I said .
“ I do n’t like it , ” Kenzie said .
It was an abrupt statement , cutting into the dialogue , the serious tone different from the easy back - and - forth .
“
We would n’t be leaving you out , ” Sveta said .   
“
You said you were interested in what Victoria knew about heroes , and you ’d be part of the team when we got started .
”
“
No I would n’t , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Because you all would be doing what you have to do to help Rain , and I ’d be on the sidelines .   
You said you do n’t want to have a kid there in a dangerous situation , so I would n’t actually be there when things went down .   
And if you thought there would be an attack soon you would n’t want me hanging around in case
I got caught up in it , so you ’d all meet
and I ’d stay home then , too .
”
“
It could be over in a couple of weeks , ” Rain said .
“ It could not be over , too , ” Kenzie said .   
She smiled .   
“ Come on .   
I ’ve done this before .   
Again and again .   
I did it during the leadership camps and the exercises in San Diego .   
I did it during the branding in LA
and I kind of did it with the Baltimore Wards .
”
“
Did what ?
” I asked .
“
Got left behind .   
Or sidelined and ignored .   
The reasons were good , or maybe I ’m a stupid , gullible idiot and the reasons are bad , and I believed them anyway .
”
“ I liked your contributions to the group , I ’d want you to stick around , ” I said .
“
I know
you mean
well , Victoria , but
this is the way it always goes , ” Kenzie said .   
She shrugged .   
“
The compliments , the softening of the blow .   
I think you ’re nice
and you ’re trying to do the right thing .   
But again and again , because I ’m a kid , or because I ’m small and weak , or because I ’m a girl , or because I ’m black , or because I have school , or because I ’m vulnerable , or I ’m annoying , or because they want to be careful around me because I have problems , or because I ’ve said the wrong things because I ’m an idiot a lot of the time , or because- because whatever the reason , good or bad , hateful or kind …
”
She trailed off there .   
She was staring down at the ground , head down where I could n’t see it .   
She huffed out out a small laugh .
Her hands were on either side of her hips , gripping the sides of the plastic chair .
“
Articulate what you want , Kenzie , ” Mrs. Yamada said .   
“ Assertive .   
Not passive , not passive - aggressive .
”
“ I do n’t want to be left behind , ” Kenzie said .   
She was speaking more slowly , deliberately .   
A dramatic change of pace from her usual output .   
“
I ’m experienced in this , so when I say I think I see things going this way , it would be nice if people believed me .
”
“ More assertive , Kenzie , ” Mrs. Yamada said .
“ Trust me , ” Kenzie said , with emphasis .   
She looked up , flashed a smile at me , then shrugged .   
“
You say you ’re experienced in cape stuff
and I think it shows
and that ’s amazing .   
I ’m experienced in this
and I ’m really tired of this song and dance .
”
“ I understand , ” I said .   
“
I ’m sorry to have touched on something that sensitive .   
I should have been more considerate .
”
“
It ’s not you , ” she said .   
“
It ’s me .   
It ’s a regular thing .   
I do n’t blame you .   
It ’s the way I am , it makes people act this way around me .   
And-
”
She drew in a deep breath .
“
-And I would like to be included from the beginning , in a way where I ’m useful and participating
and I ’m not watching from the sidelines .   
I would like to do the team thing from the beginning .   
I do n’t mind if it ’s small or slow
but I want to do something with progress .   
Or if not that , then tell me upfront
so I can have my feelings hurt now right away instead of over a long time .
”
“
This is really important to you , ” I said .
“ There have only ever been three times in my life where people acted like they wanted me around .   
Not counting the adults who get paid to look after me , sorry Mrs. Yamada .   
The first one , it led to my trigger , so you can imagine how well that went .   
The second one was the couple of months I spent with the Baltimore Wards , and they do n’t want anything to do with me anymore .   
The third is here .   
These guys .
”
“
Well gee whiz , Kenzie , ” Tristan said .
She smiled , “ Sorry .
”
“ I like to win my arguments , but you ca n’t bring that kind of weaponry to bear .   
It ’s just not fair on those guys .
” Kenzie smiled again .
“
I ’m glad you like us , ” Sveta said .   
“ I do want to include you , and I hope this thing works out the way you want it to .
”
“
We ’ll figure something out , ” I said .
“
We ?
” Ashley asked .
“ I was going to say , ” Chris said .
“
I ’m not trying to step on your toes or insinuate myself into things , ” I said .   
“
But if you ’ll have me , maybe I could take on a role as coach or something .   
If you really want to do this-
”
I could see the looks on their faces .   
Yeah , they wanted to do this .
“ -Then maybe we avoid having you guys go from a mediated discussion in a controlled environment like this to … something more loosely supervised and managed , for the mediation part of things , and we look for a shallower pool to dive into instead , where you can get started in some capacity sooner , we ensure everyone has something to do , but we keep it manageable and small .
”
“ You ’re volunteering ?
” Tristan asked .
“
If Mrs. Yamada is okay with this idea .   
I do n’t see you guys changing your minds , so … ” “
It would bring me some peace of mind , ” Mrs. Yamada said .
“ Mediated , ” Rain said .   
“
You ’d be babysitting us ?
”
“ Coaching , giving direction if it ’s lacking , give you someone to turn to if you need someone to help resolve a dispute .   
I ca n’t promise you full time hours , it ’d be a secondary or minor thing for me , but
…
I ’m
trying to think of a good way to tackle this and this is the best idea I ’ve got .
”
“
Yes , ” Kenzie said .   
“ I want to hear more about the heroing stuff .
”
“ I would n’t object , ” Ashley said .
“ And the shallow end ?
” Tristan asked .








“ I felt energized after , ” I said .
“
Can you elaborate on that ?
” Mrs. Yamada asked .
“
My cousin remarked I looked better , more in touch with the world .  
Normally , I get these intrusive … non - thoughts .
” “ Non - thoughts ?
”
Rain asked .
“ Like , not intrusive thoughts , not ideas that I ca n’t get out of my head , but my mind has these places it tries to go , and I reflexively shut them out .  
Like , one thing , I spent two years in the hospital and in the care home , obsessing , ” I said .
“ I know what you ’re talking about , ” Sveta said .
“
Yeah .
And I feel like I ’ve devoted enough thought to that .  
Two years of time , more than a lifetime ’s worth .  
So I lock up , mentally , or trip over the subject .  
I get that a lot as my mood gets worse .  
I have it for things I do , like using my powers .  
I had it a lot less after the day at the hospital .
”
“ Some people have physiological signs , feeling ill , headaches , breathing , when they ’re trying to find an outlet for things they ca n’t otherwise express , ” Mrs. Yamada said .  
“
Others have habits , things or people they go back to , they could have needs or cravings .
”
“
What if the thing you turn to is also the thing that causes stress ?
” Kenzie asked .
“
That is absolutely a thing that happens , Kenzie .  
It ’s at the root of downward spirals like addiction or overeating .  
On a more subtle level , something like a panic disorder can self - reinforce because the panic provides relief , even as it makes the actual situations worse .  
I like that Victoria identified something that arrests or controls the downward spiral .
”
“
It ’s the sort of thing I plan to do again , ” I said .   
“
Putting all the other stuff aside , distilling things down to the most basic route of helping people , in a way that ’s good and healthy for me , too .   
Or-
”
Mrs. Yamada had started speaking at the same time I added the ‘ or’ .   
We both stopped .
“ Go ahead , ” she said .
“ Or
where there ’s bad , the good is enough to outweigh that bad and leave me better off ,
” I said .   
I shrugged .
“
Here in the group , we often discuss the issues we ’re facing , how we relate to what others bring up , and we talk about solutions .   
I ’ll periodically try to turn things to more positive topics , but with six people here , it ’s common for people to come to the session with something they want to delve into .
“ I like that you ’re dwelling on the good things , Victoria , and that you ’re giving me an excuse to turn things toward a better note as we wrap up .   
Does anyone else have something to share ?
”
Tristan raised one hand a little , and Mrs. Yamada nodded , giving him permission to say .
“
It ’s not positive , ” he said .   
“
I do n’t know if that ’s alright .
”
“
It ’s fine .   
Go ahead .
”
“
What Victoria was saying , how she was saying she was happy , seeing the kids happy , and how she felt energized after .   
I do n’t have that .   
I do n’t have a way to recharge when I ’m not at one hundred percent .
”
“ You definitely have things you ’re passionate about , ” Rain said .
“ I like people , parties , noise , really letting the walls drop away and having fun .  
There are things I ’d want to go out and do which
I ca n’t .  
Things
I ’m not comfortable talking about with Kenzie
present .
”
Kenzie smiled at him .  
“ Rude stuff .   
I ’m not that young .
”
“
I know you probably know , I ’m still not comfortable talking about it like this ,
” Tristan said .
“
You say Kenzie
but you do n’t even mention me , ” Chris said .  
“ I ’m perversely pleased by that .  
You mean fucking , right ?
”
“ Please , Chris , ” Mrs. Yamada said .
“ I mean stuff , ” Tristan said , “
Stuff I ca n’t do because of my situation .  
I did some of it back before the trigger .  
More like sophomore high schoolers stealing their parents booze and having way too many people in a house while the parents are away , but that was the time of my life .  
It was when I was the most excited to be on this- on that planet .  
Now I ca n’t do stuff like that , the pressure release valve is screwed up for the same reasons I ’m screwed up .
”
“ The case seventy stuff , ” I said .
“
Yeah , ” he said .   
“
Now me passing out drunk might mean I screw up the time window for passing back control , however many alarms I set , and I ca n’t do that to Byron .   
I ca n’t go have a one night stand because the way things are mean I ’d be involving him in it as a bystander or voyeur .
”
“
Can you find new outlets ?
” Sveta asked .  
“
One thing I ’ve learned over the past little while is that I still had a lot of growing to do .   
It ’s easy when you ’re in a bad place to think
‘ this is it , this is me,’
but there ’s always more out there .
”
“
I ’m trying , ” Tristan said .   
“
But it sucks to know that the stuff I want to do and the people I want to do are out there
and I ca n’t do that .  
I know it ’s the same for Byron .   
It ’s different for him , though , because he ’s a quiet guy , he wants to take it easy , but you get the weird conflict where you want to chill out but you ca n’t because you also want to maximize your use of time , when you only get to live half your life .
”
“ I ’d like to talk about that at a later point , when we ’re not a minute away from wrapping up , ” Mrs. Yamada said .   
“ I ’d also like to have a word with Byron and you after the session , make sure everything ’s okay .
”
“
Sure , ” Tristan said .
“ On a positive note , if nobody minds , ” Sveta said , sitting up with the faintest of metal - on - metal sounds .   
“ I got to recharge too , but it was a big one .
”
“
Your trip ?
” Kenzie asked .
“
I know we talked about it last week , but we mostly talked about Rain staying safe and the hero team thing .   
It was n’t a little pick me up .   
It was big , and I really want to find the chances to go and do stuff like that again .
”
“ Traveling ?
” I asked .   
Her smile was contagious .
“ Traveling .   
We had a boat , and when we were n’t around people , I got out of my hamster ball .   
We stayed pretty close to the coasts , Weld sailing or driving the boat and me swimming .   
It was really , really nice .
”
“ I can tell you got a lot of sun , ” Tristan said .
Sveta smiled .   
Her face was so pale that her complexion was borderline impossible for a human .   
“ I like swimming .   
I want to find a way to get out and do it more .   
It ’s the first time I can remember moving and having there be resistance .   
Everything else is too hard or too reflex .
”
“
Anyone else ?
” Mrs. Yamada asked .   
“
Final words ?   
Thoughts ?
”
“
I ’m glad you had a good time , ” Kenzie said .
“ I really did , ” Sveta said .
There was a pause .   
No responses , the only sound was a clack as the wind blew the blinds away from the window and they swung back into position .   
I wondered how bad the rain was .
Mrs. Yamada looked up at the clock , then said , “ Then we should wrap up .   
Tristan , a word .   
Everyone else , have a good week .   
There wo n’t be a Friday meeting this week , so I will see you next Tuesday .
”
“ I ’d like to exchange people ’s contact information , if it ’s okay , ” I said .   
“
If you ’re wanting to do this .
”
“ You keep saying that like you ’re hoping we wo n’t , ” Ashley said .
“
It might make things simpler , ” I said .
“ The others have my number , ” she said .   
“
I do n’t keep track of it .
”
“
Sure , ” I said .
“
Do you guys mind giving Victoria my number while you ’re at it ?
” Tristan asked .
“ Can do , ” Rain said .
People were standing , now .   
Tristan gave Sveta a hand in getting to her feet .
The group , Tristan excepted , filed out into the hallway .   
A few people had coats draped or hooked on the the stacked plastic chairs along the hallway ’s length .   
I ’d left my bag on the ground .   
I pulled my phone out before I slung it over one shoulder .
A message from Crystal , asking if I was coming home for dinner .
“ Pass me your number ?
”
Rain asked .   
His phone was as battered as he was , with a crack running down the case .
I thumbed through the concentric rings , put my thumb on my phone number and profile information , and then flicked it in Rain ’s direction .
“
Got it , ” he said .
His info appeared on my phone , at the top edge .   
It was soon joined by Tristan
’s
, then Kenzie ’s and Ashley
’s , near simultaneously .   
Kenzie ’s name was framed with colorful symbols .   
Chris ’s and Sveta ’s
were the last to appear .
Rain had handled sending me Sveta ’s , Ashley ’s and Tristan
’s
, it seemed .   
Ashley was pulling on a raincoat , and Sveta ’s hands were clasped in front of her .
Sveta might have sent me hers without using her hands , now that I thought about it .   
It was possible she had a phone in her suit .
I glanced back into the room , to see if Mrs. Yamada had anything she wanted to convey with a look or gesture .   
Instead , I saw her talking to someone who was n’t Tristan .
Byron had black hair , shorter than Tristan ’s , slicked back with something that shone in the room
’s lights .   
He wore a jacket , a black v - neck shirt , and jeans .   
The contrast between him and Tristan in everything but facial features were striking- Tristan had been bright haired , his top and shorts all about contrasts with light and dark , color and lack thereof .   
He ’d brimmed with confidence .
Byron did n’t .   
He looked distinctly uncomfortable , his hands in his jacket pockets , shoulders forward , a look of concern on his face .   
The muted gray - blue of his jacket , the black v - neck shirt , the jeans , there were n’t any of the intentional contrasts I ’d seen in Tristan .
“
Are we going to wait for Tristan and try to have a quick chat about things ?
”
Rain asked .
“ I have dinner , ” Kenzie said .   
She looked at me .   
“
I try to have dinner with my parents every night .   
We ’re trying to reinforce that normalcy .
”
“
Is that going alright ?
” Sveta asked .
“
It ’s going , ” Kenzie said .   
She smiled .   
“
Which is better than the alternative .
”
“
I ’m all people’d out , ” Chris said .   
“
Most of you guys are better than some , but I ’m done for now .
”
“
That ’s a good enough reason to put it off , then , ” Rain said .   
He gripped the doorframe , leaning into the room a little .   
I heard Mrs. Yamada ’s voice stop .
“
Yes ?
” she asked .
“ Wanted to let Tristan and Byron know we ’re heading out .   
We ’re not meeting today .
”
“ Okay , ” Byron said .   
“
He ’ll have heard you .
”
He sounded different , even .   
Quieter , in the way people talked if they were sure they ’d be heard regardless , if they did n’t care , or , on the other side of things if they knew they would n’t be listened to .
“
We ’ll hang out , ” Rain said .   
“
You and me , we ’ll do something soon .
”
“
Okay .   
How ’s Erin ?
”
“
She ’s good , ” Rain said .   
“
I could invite her to come with .
”
“ I would n’t mind .
”
“
Yeah , for sure , ” Rain said .
Rain was still smiling when he stepped away from the door .
“
Let ’s go , ” Rain said .
I had to pause as Kenzie and Chris got out of my way and turned to head down the hallway , while Rain and Ashley led the way .   
I did n’t catch Ashley and Rain ’s brief exchange of words .
I glanced back at the room , and saw Byron was looking at me while he was saying something to Mrs. Yamada .   
The up - down look , followed by the quick glance away when he realized I ’d seen him .
You ’re too young for me
and you ’re not my type , based on what little I ’ve seen and heard , I thought .
Sveta took my arm , squeezing it .   
My reminder to focus on the others .
“
You ’re okay ,
” Sveta said , squeezing harder for a moment .   
“ You can talk .
”
“ You seem to be doing okay yourself , ” I said .
“
I ’m great , ” she said .   
“
Today was a good day .
”
We walked to catch up , and I could feel Sveta periodically leaning harder on me as she worked to maintain her stride .   
For all that she was in there , no doubt pulling on multiple components and relying on intricate machinery , she managed
pretty darn
well .
A little less so on the stairs to the ground floor , but I gave her my arm and plenty of support , and she did okay .
She hugged me with enthusiasm as we walked the five feet from the stairs to the side door , where the others were waiting under the rectangle of roof that jutted out from the side of the boxy building .
“
I ’m going , ” Chris said .   
“ Bye .
”
“ Bye , ” Sveta said , amid a few other scattered responses .   
I raised one hand in a token wave .
Chris removed his headphones as he walked away , stowing them in one pocket of his cargo shorts .   
He did n’t use an umbrella or wear a raincoat .   
He seemed content to get rained on .
Kenzie had a blue raincoat with duffle coat toggles on the front , and was standing a bit in the rain , head bent over her phone .   
Ashley stood on the sidewalk , her hood up .   
Rain had settled for an umbrella , but had n’t opened it yet .
“
I ’m walking to the bus station in Webster , ” Rain said .   
“ Normally Tristan , Sveta , and I walk that way .
”
“ I can head that way , ” I said .   
“
I ’ll walk with you guys for a bit .
”
“ I ’ll come , ” Kenzie said , not looking up from her phone .   
“
There ’s still time before dinner .
”
“
You sure ?
” Sveta asked .
“
Yep , ” Kenzie looked up from her phone .
“ And Ashley ?
” I asked .
She did n’t reply , turning away to look down the length of the road .   
She turned around , looking the other way .   
In that moment , a car appeared .
“ I ’ve got a ride , ” she said .
“ Spending time with the the ol’ guardians ?
” Sveta asked .
I did n’t miss the word choice .   
The forced cavalier attitude .   
Awkward .
“ I try to get as many of my appointments into the same day as I can , ” Ashley said .   
“
It ’s nuisance enough to have my day disrupted with this inanity , I do n’t want it taking over my weeks .
”
“
We ’re inanity , are we ?
”
Rain asked .
“
You can be , ” Ashley said .   
“ Checkups and tests , therapy , group therapy , being supervised without it being official supervision , interviews , prosthetics tune - ups , work .   
It becomes inane .
”
“
It ’s all for good reasons , ” Sveta said .
“ I ’d do better without all of the distractions , ” Ashley said .   
She looked at me , and she did the up - down assessment too .   
It was something different from what Byron had done .   
“
I look forward to learning what you have to teach .
”
“
It was nice to meet you , ” I said .   
I was n’t sure if I was lying , but it seemed like the thing to say .
She walked down the little dirt path that extended through the grass from the building
’s side door to the road .   
A black sedan .   
She opened the back door , climbed in , and closed the door with more force than was probably necessary .
“
I have so many questions , ” I said .
“
Weld ’s kind - of dad figure was the Director in charge of the Boston PRT , ” Sveta said .   
“
He was also kind of in charge of looking after Ashley , because her town was close to Boston .
”
“ Making sure she did n’t do too much damage ?
” I asked .
“
Yes .   
And gradually trying to get her used to the idea of cooperating with the good guys , making sure she was staying reasonably healthy .   
They reached out regularly , letting her know there were better options .   
Except that Ashley was a different Ashley .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
She ’s going to be on your team ?
”
“
Yeah , ” Sveta said .
I did n’t have a response for that .
She squeezed my arm .   
“
I spent a lot of time with a lot of people who never got a chance , Victoria .   
I feel like it ’s my duty to give her one .
”
I drew in a deep breath , then sighed .   
“ I do n’t disagree .
”
“
But you do n’t wholly agree , either ?
”
Rain asked .
“ I … believe in second chances .   
Not necessarily in every circumstance , though , which seems to be the direction a lot of people are going .
”
“ We should walk , ” Rain said .   
“
The sooner we get where we split off in different directions , the earlier Kenzie can head back to her parents’ and make it on time for dinner .
”
“
Yes , please , ” Kenzie said , still looking down at her phone .
Sveta had an umbrella .   
I held it so Sveta could walk while leaning on me , the two of us sharing it .
There were n’t many cars on the road , and even with the overcast sky making it rather dark out for the late afternoon , there were n’t many lights on either .   
The route we were walking put us on a long stretch of road with small businesses and restaurants on either side .   
Most of the illumination came from store signs in bright colors that were reflected in the puddles .
“
I did n’t get a great read on Chris , ” I said .   
“
He ’s the other big set of question marks .
”
“ I like Chris , ” Kenzie said , without looking up .   
“
He ’s crazy smart about some things and adorkably stupid about others .   
He ’s hard to figure out but when he lets you in it makes you feel special .
”
She said something like that with no compunctions ,
no reservations .   
I almost envied her .
Sveta reached out and placed a hand on top of Kenzie ’s hood .   
“
It would be unfair to share Chris’ story when he did n’t want to share it himself , Victoria .   
I only said what I said about Ashley because she ’s open about it .
”
“
In fairness , I was n’t asking or prying , ” I said .   
“ I was remarking .
”
“
Remarking with a question mark at the end ?
” Rain asked .
“
Inviting an answer , but not pressing for one , ” I said .   
“
I can drop it .
”
“
Okay , ” Kenzie said .   
She put her phone away .   
“
All caught up .   
Stir fry for dinner , I ’m going to pick up broccoli , and my workshop is warming up for later .
”
“ You ’ve got a workshop , like a proper tinker , ” I said .
“
Absolutely , ” Kenzie said , dead serious .
“
Are you hiding a jetpack inside that raincoat , or are those rocket boots ?
” I asked .
“
I wish , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I ca n’t do that stuff .   
I make cameras and inconveniently big boxes .   
My best stuff is inconveniently big , box - shaped cameras .
”
“ Big boxes ?
” I asked .
“
The term in my file is emplacements .   
Terminals , tech , and computers big enough they ’re hard to move around .   
Like turrets , but I ca n’t really make good weapons or defensive things .
”
“ I see .   
I can see why Watchdog wanted you .
”
“ Grr , arf .
”
And I might be able to see why your supervisors wanted to keep you away from the front lines .
“
Out of curiosity , ” I said .   
“
Where are people ?   
I ’m trying to figure out where you guys are situated and what locations might work .
”
“
I ’m from Norwalk Station , ” Kenzie said .
Norwalk Station would be off to the west end of Norfair , where we had the community center incident .   
The ‘ Nor’ part of Norfair .   
It was a nice - ish area .   
I ’d passed through it a few times .   
“
And you ’re in school ?   
Are you in the morning or afternoon block ?
”
“ Morning .   
I joined the study block for afternoons , I keep good grades so they let me , and I have paperwork from before that says they ’re not supposed to give me too much homework , so I do n’t have too much to do in the afternoons .
”
“ They might expect you to check in , ” I said .
“ They might .
”
“
Weld and I are in Stratford , so is Ashley , ” Sveta said .   
“
Chris lives somewhere around here .   
Tristan is close to here .
”
Here being Fairfield .
“ Bridgeport span , here , ” I said .   
“
I ’m closer to you guys in Stratford than not .
”
“
Of course I ’m the furthest out , ” Kenzie said .
“ Almost , ” Rain said .
“ Almost , ” Kenzie echoed him .
“
Where are you situated ?
”
I asked Rain .
“
It ’s complicated , ” he said .
“ Uh huh .   
That ’s starting to sound like a catchphrase .
”
“ I hate saying it as much as people hate hearing it .   
Locationwise , I ’ve always liked saying I ’m from everywhere
that is n’t anywhere .
”
I gave him a look .
“
Stop being vague and teasing Victoria , ” Sveta said .
“
I ’m not teasing .   
I ’m in the middle of nowhere
, it ’s hard to pin down .   
North of Greenwich .   
It ’s a trip to get here .
”
That put Tristan , Byron and Chris close to center , Kenzie out west , Rain out to the far northwest , me a bit to the east , and Sveta and Ashley a bit further to the east .   
With the trains I was figuring it might take about four or five hours for Kenzie to get to where Sveta and Ashley were situated .   
It would take Rain another couple of hours , depending on how far north he was .
“
That ’s a pretty significant logistics problem , ” I said .   
“ Even in the best case scenario , if we found a place close to here , that ’s a two hour or more trip for people to get here ?
”
“
I could build something , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I ca n’t make promises .
”
“ How confident are you ?
” I asked .
“
Kind of confident , ” she said , sounding anything but .   
“ I have n’t done teleportation or breaking movement devices before , but if I made it a series of emplacements and built them big , then if I traveled once a week or so to visit the send - receives and make sure they do n’t break down , it might work .
”
“ Tinker stuff breaks , ” I said .
“ It does , ” Kenzie said .
“ It would also be liable to break or break down when you needed it to work the most .   
During disasters , or times when there are n’t a lot of downtime .
”
“
That ’s very true , ” Kenzie said .
“
I ’m wondering if there ’s even a good way to go about this .   
I ’m not trying to screw you guys up , I ’m genuinely wondering .
”
“ It might not be as complicated as it seems , ” Sveta said .   
“
I can move quickly if I have to
, Ashley does n’t have much occupying her days , when she does n’t have her appointments , and I do n’t think she minds much .   
She ’s happy to wake up early and read on the train , she even goes to the New York hub a lot , and that ’s a full day trip .   
As for you , you can fly again-
”
She squeezed my arm as she said it , rocking a bit side to side as she did it .   
I rocked a bit with her .
“
-and the way you were talking about things , this would n’t be a full - time thing for you , ” Sveta finished .   
Her enthusiasm had risen as she talked , and only dropped with that last part .
“ Maybe , ” I said .   
“
It seems you ’d want a location that was closer to Kenzie and Chris then .   
Closer to Rain .
”
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .   
He was looking around a fair bit .   
“
I do n’t mind the trips , either .
”
“
You okay ?
”
I asked him .
“
Yeah .   
Forgot for a short while that I have an attempt out on my life .   
I really should dwell on it more , to be safe , especially with Kenzie in tow .
”
“ I can hold my own , ” Kenzie said .
“
It ’s an attempt on my life , ” Rain said .   
“
Lives could be lost .   
I do n’t want yours to be one of them .   
I would feel insanely shitty if you jumped in to help and you got hurt or killed .
”
“
Insanely ?
”
“
Yes .
”
“ Okay .
”
“
I ’m going to call my ride , I think .   
See if she can catch me en route instead of me going to her , ” Rain said .
“
She ?   
Erin the lady friend ?
” Kenzie asked .
“
Erin the friendship
I ’m not going to mess with , ” Rain said .    
He pulled out the phone and stepped a bit away , walking at the road
’s edge instead of on the sidewalk .
We reached an intersection , and Rain stepped away , one hand to his ear while he held the phone to the other .   
His eyes roved , looking at nearby rooftops and the dark spaces between buildings .
The building at the corner of the intersection was a bar , and a group of ten or so people were standing outside , smoking .   
The place and the people smelled like the cheap alcohol that was barely a step above moonshine , that was being sold on the cheap in a lot of places .   
Made to fill a need , now a surplus , with cheap , shitty beer available to fill the need instead .
Their attention was on Sveta .
“
Hey , ” one called out .
She glanced at them , then set to ignoring them .   
I took her cue .
“
Hey , ” the guy called out again , drawing out the word .   
“
Hey , you with the paint .
”
“
Whatever you ’re going to say , I ’ve heard it before , ” Sveta said .
“
What the fuck ’s going on with you , huh ?   
What ’s wrong with you ?
”
he called out .
I turned my head to look at him .   
Sveta squeezed my arm , then shook her head a little .
“
Hey , you ’re weird , ” he called out .   
“
You ’re freaky .
”
The light changed .   
We crossed , Rain trailing a bit behind , still on the phone , periodically responding .   
He shot the guys a dark look .
“
I do n’t like it when people are mean to you , ” Kenzie said .
“
Thank you for that , ” Sveta said .   
“
And thank you , Victoria .   
I know you probably wanted to say something .   
I ’m glad we did n’t make it into a thing .
”
“
Does it happen a lot ?
” I asked .
“
Some .   
It beats people running away and screaming , and the running and screaming part beat people dying because of me , ” Sveta said .   
“
This is an improvement .   
Things will improve more in the future .   
I believe that .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
Me too .
”
“
Me too ,
” Kenzie said .
Sveta put a hand on Kenzie ’s hooded head , squeezed my arm .
“
My ride ’s here , ” Rain said , catching up with us , waving at a distant vehicle with its headlights on .   
I got a better view of it as it pulled up beside us .   
It was n’t a pretty vehicle – a van with rust around the right headlight .   
“
We ’ve got a good long drive back .   
Was good seeing you guys , good to meet you , Victoria .
”
“
Good to meet you , Rain , ” I said .
The driver stuck her hand out , waving .   
We moved around to where we could see her through the passenger - side window .
Erin , Rain ’s friendship he was n’t intending to mess with , was not the kind of person I imagined driving a van like that , or spending time with someone of Rain ’s somewhat grungy , not - inclined - to - smile presentation .   
There were women where someone ’s first thought might be ‘ they could be a model’ and there were women where the first thought was ‘ they have to be a model ,
it ’s not fair if they aren’t’ .   
She was the latter .   
Short black hair with a long swoop at the front , dangly jewelry , more piercings in one ear , and one of the memorial shirts , much like how the dress I was wearing served as a way for me to represent and remember Brockton Bay .   
She was from New York , it seemed , or she wanted to represent it .
“
Erin , you ’ve seen Kenzie and Sveta before .
”
“
Hi again , ” Erin said .
“
And this is Victoria .   
We were talking about having her be our coach .
”
“ Hi , ” Erin said , leaning toward Rain to get a better view of me , extending her hand in another wave .   
Rain looked momentarily like a deer in the headlights with Erin ’s face close , with Erin doing a very good job at not noticing or not looking like she ’d noticed .   
“
You look a lot like Glory Girl .
”
“ I am , ” I said .   
“
I was .
”
“ Huh , ” Erin said .   
“
That ’s really cool .   
Maybe I ’ll see you around ?
”
“
It ’s likely , ” I said .
“ You guys have a good night .
”
“
You too , ” Kenzie said .   
She held up her phone , like she was trying to get a signal .   
“ Drive safe .
”
“
We good to go ?
” Erin asked .
“
Yep , ” Rain said .   
“
You want a ride somewhere convenient , Kenz ?
”
“
Sure ! ”
Kenzie climbed in behind Rain , giving us a wave before the door was closed .
Just Sveta and me left .
We watched as the van pulled away .
“ I have a lot of sympathy for Rain , ” Sveta said .
“
Are you talking about the attempt on his life or the long car trip with the girl he very clearly likes ?
”
“
Oh ,
yeah , the dangerous thing too , ” Sveta said .   
“
Mostly the long trip .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“
But that ’s all negative .   
We ’re going in the same direction , right ?   
We can catch up ?
”
“ We can definitely catch up .   
I want to hear more about that vacation .
”
“
And you can come over for dinner , right ?   
Sometime ?   
You ’re not far .   
I ca n’t promise a   good dinner , because I ’m still trying to find food that Weld can really taste that wo n’t make the neighbors evacuate their apartments , but there ’s takeout !    Or delivery .   
I ’m sure there ’s something we can do .
”
“
You could n’t keep me away , ” I said .
⊙ Sleep eluded me .   
I stood on the balcony , I stared out at a city without nearly enough lights or light in it , a jagged and incomplete skyline , and I tried to shake a persistent melancholy I could n’t put my finger on .
The day had been a good one .   
My friendship with Sveta rekindled , with Sveta doing as well as I could hope for , possibilities for the future , interesting puzzles to work out , and I ’d been able to do favors for people I cared about .
A part of it was the therapy .   
It was strange , to be in a place mentally and emotionally where therapy had a cost to it , in a way .   
The voice of Mrs. Yamada and the tone of the conversations reminded me of the darkest period in my life .   
Those reminders were probably responsible for the nightmares that had torn me from sleep .
Maybe it would be good if I called the new therapist , a new voice .
It was n’t the nightmares that kept me from getting back to sleep , but a restless nagging feeling .   
I liked problems I could decisively solve , things I could tell myself I had an answer for , something I could handle in the dawn , and then I could go back to sleep .   
The feeling that had settled with me was n’t that sort of answerable question .
It was the restless nagging that had me carefully and slowly open the sliding door of the balcony , step into the living room , and gather some things .   
A bag with my wallet and things , fresher clothes , the mask I ’d worn for the broken trigger incident .
I went flying , and my destination was n’t one that would answer the nagging feeling , but one that could answer other , more concrete questions .   
With luck , I ’d be able to distract myself .
There were cities and areas I ’d considered for the therapy group ’s expedition .   
Ones in need , ones I knew did n’t fall neatly in one jurisdiction or another .   
I used the highways and major roadways as my waypoints , so I would n’t pass them or find myself flying too far north or south .
The sun was rising by the time I reached the first .   
Sherwood span .   
Too low a population , I could tell right away .   
Too many farms , the houses too spread out .
It took me twenty minutes to reach the next .   
The area was slow to wake up , which was a surprise , given the amount of construction sites I could see from above .   
Usually the work started first thing .
It was a nice slice of city , with a view of the water , tall buildings , shiny , modern , with nice , large houses , but it was only halfway erected .     
There were cars in driveways , but there was n’t much life .
I flew low , stopping at one of the gates to a construction site for a taller building .
Laminated sheets had been put up on the gates .
Construction suspended until we ’re given what we ’re owed .
The same was on display in other places , with laminated sheets of paper and graffiti .   
Some of it was angrier .
I was reading a very bold , large bit of text about how certain people should be choking on cocks , when I saw I had company , standing in the corner of my field of view .   
A cape .
I turned to face them .
Not anyone I recognized .   
A man in armor with spikes on it .   
Plate mail , and plate armor was hard to get done right , especially in this modern day .   
He carried no weapon I could see .   
Spiky plate armor was n’t exactly original or new , either .
He did n’t say anything or do anything , but he was holding a piece of paper .
I approached him , my forcefield up .   
He did n’t budge .
When I was in arm
’s reach , he put his gauntlet toward me , paper in hand .   
I dropped my forcefield to take it .
“
What ’s this ?
”
He was n’t someone who sounded more intimidating from the inside of a helmet .   
His voice was very normal as he said , “ We saw you fly in , we discussed , we called some people , this is our message to you .
”
“
Got it , ” I said .   
I looked around .   
“ Quiet town .
”
When my head was turned , he reached for my throat .
I put my forcefield up , and I knocked his hand aside , forcefully enough I almost put him on his ass .   
The sound rang in my ears .
“ Our town , ” he said .
That said , he trudged off .
I watched him go , and then I walked in the opposite direction .   
People were watching from doorsteps with coffee in hand , or standing by cars , now .
I did n’t want to back down or look weak , not if this was possibly a place I might be visiting with any regularity , so I walked slowly , like I was n’t bothered .
With all that in mind , I still stopped in my tracks when I read the note .
Turn around and fly home , Glory Hole 

-TT
They ’d asked around , huh ?
I folded the paper up , and I held the folded square as I walked , thinking , observing .   
A slice of city , paralyzed , a clear villain presence .
The guy with the spikes might have been Cleat .   
A low - tier cape with some background in fighting rings and mercenary work .   
Unlike most in fighting rings , he ’d never found enough success to get traction in other circles .   
Ironically .
I ’d left Brockton Bay in the middle of a situation , or I ’d been taken from the city during .   
I ’d put in the hours and put heart and soul into trying to combat the badness that was taking over the city , and at the end of the day , I had n’t ever enjoyed a resolution to that situation .   
I ’d never felt like I ’d made enough of a difference in the end result .
It was tempting , the idea of coming here to a place like this and somehow completing that journey or using a success here to convince myself I could have made a proper difference if I ’d been given a chance .
But this was n’t about me .   
It was about those teenagers and kids in Yamada ’s group .
A sign was erected by one construction site .   
It was covered in graffiti .   
‘
Cedar Point Apartments’ was written at the top , but ‘ Cedar’ had been covered over in paint , and ‘ Hollow’ had been written in its place .
Cute , and from some cursory investigation , the rebranding had been performed elsewhere , throughout the district .   
Graffiti and other signs of anger were clear as day , much of it vile and senseless .
Did I really want to pit those kids against this ?   
They might give it a shot , and if it was insurmountable , Mrs. Yamada might be happy , and if it was surmountable , everyone would be happy .
I was n’t sure .
I looked at the graffiti , getting a sense of the atmosphere here .   
Vulgarity , vulgarity , obscenity , drawing of vulgarity , hate , anger , vulgarity , possible gang tag , ‘ hollow point’ appearing again .
I stopped in front of another piece of graffiti .   
It was n’t crowded in with anything else , so it stood out , almost a piece of art in how it was spelled out on a ruined wall , half - toppled .
THIS IS HOW
THINGS
ARE
NOW I had the paper in my hand
, I had my doubts , but the nagging feeling ceased being nagging and became acutely clear as I looked at the statement .








Cities , like people , got their second chances .   
Few cities had needed one so badly as this .   
I was left hoping the other cities were doing better with their second opportunities , because nothing I was seeing was very promising , here .
The four teams under the Wardens’ umbrella , now condensed down to three , were divided into those who wanted to return to the way things had been and those who wanted to forge a new way forward , learning from the mistakes of the past .   
The appeal of returning to a semblance of what we ’d had was clear-
we missed the foods , the places , the familiar businesses and media , the familiar faces .
We wanted normal and even now every meal , every soap we used , every piece of clothing , it was a reminder of how far from normal we were .   
It was different and often less because we had less , and we had less of a footing .   
I was n’t the only person who felt their stomach sink when we saw the news two weeks after the broken trigger had decimated the reconstruction workers’ protest , saying that the transportation strike was imminent , and that factory workers were contemplating joining in , an across - the - board attempt to demand stability and structure .
It was important , a line had to be drawn and the endless talks about what our government would look like needed to end , but I still saw the reports and I knew the foods , clothes , and routine I wanted were going to have to wait that much longer .
That was one of the prevailing arguments for normal , for going back .   
This section of the city , this settlement , was the counterpoint .
Brockton Bay had been a port , growing as the industry did .   
A lot of what made it work as a fledgling port city made New Brockton work as one of our first footholds in Earth Gimel .   
Lumber , quarrying , some surface level minerals , and geography protected from the harshest sweeps of cold weather from the north .
The industry had become a prominent part of the city , and then the greater industry had outgrown it .   
Things had reached the point where it was easier to take one big ship and go to Boston and transport goods from there than to take two smaller ships and go to Brockton Bay , even if Brockton Bay was closer to the goods’ destination .   
The factories and goods went where the ships went , because it was n’t sensible to ship raw materials from Boston to Brockton Bay to do manufacturing when Boston could handle it .
New Brockton felt like it sat on that brink between relevance and ruin .   
As a settlement , it was defined by tall buildings and the edifices of heavy industry .   
There were ships finding their way past each other on the water and big brick buildings with black plumes of smoke rising from their chimneys .   
Already back to the ways of an era that predated me , cutting corners to produce more at a cost to tomorrow .   
It was crowded and bursting at the seams , and it had been for a while now , trying to grow despite the constraints of water and mountain around it .
It did n’t escape me that the settlement continued to chug along while the gears and belts of the greater megalopolis were grinding to a stop under strikes and shutdowns .
I walked , rather than fly , because the directions I ’d been given mandated it .   
I suspected it was intentional .   
I knew there were eyes on me , I knew who some of those eyes belonged to , and I had strong suspicions about others .
The racist graffiti no longer dominated downtown , though I did see some , with half of it partially painted over or altered .   
Many of the people who had lived and thrived in Brockton Bay had made their way here , after all .   
An attempt had been made to use wall space , to give the tenements - and - factories color when mirrored windows on skycrapers did n’t steal it from the sky or water .   
Murals now decorated many of the walls and building fronts , no doubt an attempt to leave less open wall space for the gang tags and symbols .   
Animals and symbols of humanity like clasped hands covered residential areas .   
Green trees , branches , and lush mountains painted almost ironically on the sides of factories and power plants .
There were places that mirrored home , in layout and the buildings that had been placed .   
The area that had been the Towers at the southwest corner of the city was still the Towers .   
Downtown was still where Downtown had been .   
A Lord Street stabbed north - to - south through the settlement .   
Despite the attempts , it was n’t home .   
It came from something different .
Such was the counterpoint : in attempting to paint a picture of home , we might distort or create a caricature of that picture .   
If we rushed it or forced it , we risked making some of the same fundamental mistakes we ’d made before , building on cracked foundations .
Seeing the murals , the directions I ’d received started to make sense .   
The path was byzantine .   
Go the way the wolf and his cubs are looking .   
A wolf and three cubs that looked like they were made of white smoke were painted on a concrete wall .   
They stood facing one way , but their heads were looking back .
Walk beneath the leaping rabbit .   
A rabbit decorated an arch at the edge of a children ’s park .   
The park felt small and lonely amid larger , taller buildings , partially fenced in , with room for two swings , a slide , a sandbox and one basketball half - court that would have to be vacated if a car came through to use the parking garage or if the dump truck came for the dumpster at the back of a building .
Follow the snake .
If I had n’t known it was a snake , I might not have realized what it was .   
It was sectioned off , the skeleton of a winding serpent with each vertebrae several feet from the other .   
Three white pieces along one wall , a white - painted drain cover , then more segments on the wall opposite .
The painted lines of a crosswalk took me across the street .   
I followed more segments of the snake to reach one of the larger apartment complexes , four identical L - shaped buildings framing a plaza .   
The bottom floors of the buildings and the lowest floors along the inside of each ‘ L’ had some basic stores .
Two years ago , this would have been one of the nicer areas in Earth Gimel , if a little basic .   
No - name grocery store , clothing store , and home - goods store .   
It was dated already , and I could already imagine two years from now , when various murals might be faded or defaced , when the metal chairs and tables would be rusted , the stores closed or forgotten .   
The snake cut through the plaza , which could have seated two hundred people , but currently had six .   
Any earlier and there would have been people having a late lunch .   
Any later and it would be time for an early dinner or an after - work bite to eat .
A tunnel led through the body of one of the apartment buildings , leading from plaza to parking lot .   
The mural of a cat with its back twisting and arching was painted on the walls and roof .   
Its paws stuck out and across the footpath firmly pressed down on the snake
’s neck .
‘ Wait’ was the last instruction .
I checked my phone .   
One message : K : 

K. I flicked my thumb , spun up the music player and then fished my earbuds out of the pocket of my jacket .   
I put only one in , so I could keep one ear out for trouble .
I waited long enough for five songs to start and stop .   
A pair of people arrived at the plaza , got their food , ate , and left , before anything happened .   
I wondered more than once if I ’d been baited to come here as a way of making me waste time .
“ You get fifteen minutes .
”
I turned my head in the direction of the parking lot , turning off my music and pulling the ear - bud free .   
I moved my hand in a circle to catch most of the length of cord in a loop .
Tattletale had reversed her costume colors from black on lavender to a more royal purple on black .   
The same pattern of lines slashing across her costume remained- horizontal line across the upper chest , vertical line slashing down from that , to form a stylized ‘ T’ .   
Another horizontal line jutted out from halfway down , followed by another vertical line piercing that line , a smaller ‘ t’ nestled under the right arm of its big brother .   
She was n’t the type to get photographed or caught clearly on video , and it was painted in such broad strokes that I suspected many people missed it .
It kind of smacked of narcissism , I felt , to wear one ’s initials .   
The more black costume , at least , looked more distinguished .   
Her hair needed a bit of combing , like it had been tousled by the wind and it had n’t been fixed .
She was followed by a flurry of small birds that settled on the street by the exit of the alley , and by one bodyguard .   
The cape was burly , wearing a skintight suit that showed off his muscles , and wore a heavy cloth hood with eyeholes cut out , a series of ‘ x’ stitches forming a frowny - face .   
The lines around his eyes were cut deep .   
Very weary .   
He stood with his hands clasped behind him .
On the other side of the tunnel , one of the men that had been eating in the plaza had approached .   
He now stood with his back ramrod straight , his hands clasped behind him .   
Very clean cut , hair short and styled , recently shaved , t - shirt , black slacks , and shiny black shoes .
I knew Tattletale knew how my forcefield worked .   
If the man had a gun , he was potentially a danger to me .
“ I like the cat , ” I said , pointing .   
“ Subtle .
”
“ Fifteen minutes , Vicky , ” Tattletale said .   
“
It ’s going to be a lot less if you want to make small talk .   
If this becomes you wagging your finger at me and acting all holier - than - thou , I ’m walking .   
I ’m busy these days .   
The only reason I ’m giving you time out of my day is hometown respect .
”
I fished in my pocket .   
I pulled out the paper .   
“
This is n’t because you wanted to talk to me ?
”
“ When you ’re positioned like I am , you ca n’t ever do one thing .   
That message was intended to do a few things at once .
”
“ I could n’t help but notice your use of ‘ Glory Hole’ .   
Seemed unnecessarily antagonistic .
”
She leaned against the wall by the cat
’s head and smiled at me .   
“ One , I ’m unnecessarily antagonistic .   
Two , it serves to let you know who the letter is from , it pushes you off balance if you ’re in a position to be easily put off balance , which I would want to know about , and finally , three , if the messenger is the type to ignore my instructions , read the letter and try using that phrasing against you , then they ’re liable to get hurt .   
That makes it clear I ’m to be listened to .   
Cleat is n’t the brightest , and he could stand to learn that lesson .
”
“
And you wanting to talk to me was n’t one of your reasons ?
”
“
That ’s something else entirely .   
I offered Hollow Point three asks at a significant discount .   
Three times they can reach out to me and get info , now that they ’ve paid .   
I did this to get them into my debt , to see if they were intelligent enough to ask good questions , and to get them used to paying me money for intel .   
If that tide somehow rises , I want my fortunes to rise with it .   
You turned up , and they wanted to know , were you the first of a larger group of heroes who were going to make a move ?   
Who were you , and what role did you play ?
”
“
And your response was this ?
”
“ Multiple purposes , Vicky .   
Keep up .   
If you do n’t care enough you decide it ’s not worth it and leave .   
Unlikely .   
You could get a little upset , and in the doing you reveal what you ’re up to .   
Or you ’re invested on some level , and you reach out , and the dialogue is opened .   
If the dialogue is opened , I ’m better equipped to deal with you and to deal with Hollow Point .   
How the dialogue is opened tells me a lot , too .   
You could have come charging after me .   
You did n’t .   
You asked around for how to contact me , used a liaison , and you respected my direction and my rules in my part of the city .
”
My part of the city , I thought .   
Yeah .   
Impressions verified –
New Brockton had retained many of the problems of its predecessor .
“ Cedar Point is n’t yours ?
” I asked .
She shrugged .   
“
We ’ll see what it ends up being .   
For now , you ’ve got people of Cleat ’s caliber there .
”
“ I asked around a bit before leaving .
”
“ I know .
”
“ The construction work dried up , people are moving elsewhere .    
Nothing was drawing people in .   
Then , in the span of a few days , a large number of people buy apartments , homes , and other properties .   
Never mind the fact that there is n’t a lot going on there .   
Now a lot of supervillains are making themselves comfortable , figuring out who ’ll work with them and who wo n’t .   
Some places and people might be open to them doing business , others are already feeling the pressure to leave , scary people hanging around and intimidating them .   
People of Cleat ’s caliber , maybe , but an awful lot of them .
”
“
It ’s not the only place .   
It ’s the biggest of them , ” Tattletale said .   
“
All the itinerant and teamless villains needed to settle somewhere eventually .   
Hollow Point is just loose enough they wo n’t necessarily kill each other , but self preservation keeps them together and following some basic rules .   
Some charisma here and there steers them .
”
“ New Brockton does n’t count ?
” I asked .
“
Different thing .   
Hollow Point is the largest place without a major player heading things .   
So far .   
New Brockton obviously has its major players securely in place .
”
“
And even though that neighborhood is n’t yours and is n’t even close to yours , you want me gone ?
”
“
No , ” she said .   
“ You want you gone , if you know what ’s good for you .   
You do n’t want to get involved with that .   
You might make headway , but it wo n’t last .   
You ’re outnumbered , they ’ve got better resources , and if you ever succeed to any measurable degree , they can do things like call in the second of the asks they bought from me .   
Then they get an answer , and you have a bad day .
”
“
Alright , ” I said .   
I glanced back .   
The man standing at the edge of the plaza had n’t budged .   
The brute with the bag over his head had n’t either .
“
If it ’s not me they ask , then it ’s someone else , and you potentially have an even worse day .   
I know you hate my guts , but the reality is I ’m
one of the nice ones .
”
There were a lot of responses I could give to that .   
I bit my tongue .
I released my tongue and said , “ Hypothetically , if you do n’t mind hypotheticals …
”
“
I ’m a great fan of the hypothetical .
”
“ …
If I asked you where you suggested going , if Cedar Point is n’t workable or if it ’s untouchable because someone like you is going to step in before any heroes make headway
… what places would you suggest ?   
Outside of the established jurisdictions for teams .
”
“ I would n’t suggest anything .   
It ’s a wild west out there
and there ’s no place for you out there .   
Not anymore .
”
I folded my arms .   
I ’d expected an answer like this .
“
The people who win are the people with clout .   
While you were teaching school kids which direction a gun should point or hauling water out to the refugees still back on Bet , the rest of us were working .   
I and people like me were getting our hooks in and laying groundwork to build something behind the scenes .   
Taking over corner worlds , finding footholds in this world , starting up businesses , establishing reputations .   
The big hero teams have some influence because they ’ve been recruiting and they staked out their territory .   
Hero and villain , we ’re the major players , but we operate the same fundamental way .   
We ’re scary .   
The thinkers , the masters , the masterminds , and the people with the biggest guns .
”
“ And Cedar Point ?
”
“ Cedar Point , if you want to call it that , and its sister locations are late to the game .   
They have some clout because they have numbers and a bit of organization , and because they can all scrape together enough money to call in a big gun if they really truly need it .   
They probably wo n’t last .   
Someone nasty will step in and take over what they ’re trying to build and it ’s probably going to be ugly .   
The only reason they ’ve lasted this long is that the rest of us have bigger fish to fry .   
They ’re still a few rungs up the totem pole above you , mind you .
”
“
It ’s too hard
so it ’s not worth trying ?
”
“
Go home , Vicky , ” she said , almost sighing the words .   
“ Go back , figure out your family thing , keep trying to sign on to one of the big hero teams , you ’re bound to find a position somewhere eventually .   
Some cape will die in battle , and a seat will open up for you and you ’ll do fine .   
Or retire .   
After what your sister did to you , nobody would blame you .
”
I closed my eyes .
“
Do what any self - respecting twenty - one year old would do after failing to get into university , get a job waitressing or making hero sandwiches .   
Talk to your kids about the old Glory days .
”
I opened my eyes .   
“ And
what happens to Cedar Point , in this hypothetical ?
”
“ I ’m talking reality , Vicky .   
It ’s going to be the same thing that was going to happen before the villains turned up , and it ’s the same thing that ’s going to happen when and if you try and summarily fail to change things there .   
The area struggles , it withers , it becomes irrelevant .   
This is n’t your fight , and it ’s not what you ’re equipped to do .   
You hit things .   
You can take a bullet , unless you ’re doing something peculiar like keeping your forcefield down while standing between a man with a gun and Snuff here .
”
“ Heya , ” Snuff said , raising a hand .
I did n’t move a muscle , did n’t react .   
Tattletale smiled .
“ I know what you ’re doing with your forcefield , Vicky .   
Just like I did back then .   
I know why you ’re doing it , too .   
I know you do n’t belong in Cedar Point , and I know you ’re just going to cause headaches for me and the actual heroes if you try anything .   
It ’s not your skillset , it ’s not your powerset .
”
I still had the paper in my hand .   
I tapped it against my upper arm , my arms still folded .   
“ Four years , and you have n’t changed a bit since you raided that bank .
”
“ When we robbed that bank , I was doing multiple things all at once , laying groundwork for moves I would n’t make for weeks and months .   
If I have n’t changed from that , I think I ’m doing okay
, ” she said .
“
Are you , though ?
” I asked .   
“
Your hair is messy , and you look tired .
”
“
I ’m going to pretend you ’re actually asking out of a concern for my well being , because if I did n’t pretend , I ’d walk away , and I might even give some free - of - charge advice to those Hollow Point ruffians , telling them how to beat you if they run into you .
”
“ Entirely out of concern for your well being , ” I said , with as little warmth and concern in my voice as I could muster .   
“ Hometown respect , you know .
”
“
I ’m one of the major players now .   
The other major players call me for a hint when they ’re stuck on something .   
I ’m wealthy , well - positioned , and safe .   
I ’m now sharing the love and bringing some of that security , stability , and safety to others , in my very , very roundabout way .   
It ’s part of why I ’m having this conversation with you .
”
“
Sure , ” I said .   
I paused .   
“
Speaking of you
showing up , I ’m surprised the rest of your old team did n’t turn up too , for old time or camaraderie
’s sake .
”
She turned .   
With the way the light came through the tunnel , I could see the eye symbol on her chest in a slightly different shade of purple , hidden where the vertical bar met the horizontal , and the shadows meant I could no longer see her eyes or expression .    
Maintaining the same tone , she said , “ No , you ’re not surprised .   
You know
full
well they ’re well positioned too .   
They ’re doing their own things .   
They ’re still a resource I can and will tap .
”
“ Gotcha , ” I said .
“
But I think you were trying to get a jab in , and that ’s a good sign this conversation has run its course .   
I ’ll wish you good luck in your endeavors , whether you join a big team or end up making those sandwiches .   
So long as you stay out of my way .
”
“ Out of curiosity , ” I said .   
I saw her pause , just as she was about to turn to walk away .   
I continued , “ Do you regret your part in what happened with my sister ?
”
“
Do you ?
”
she asked , without missing a beat .
“
Absolutely , ” I said , without any more hesitation than she ’d shown .
“ Be sure to call before you set foot in my neighborhood again .   
You and your friend have a nice flight home .
”
Friend ?   
My first thought was that she meant my autonomous forcefield , that she was personifying it .
Then I realized who she really meant .   
Just as surprising that she would be aware , but not as alarming .
She had n’t answered my question , but I had n’t expected an answer .   
She and Snuff walked to the parking lot , turning the corner there .   
Behind me , the gunman was walking back to his table .
My impression was that I was better off heading the way I ’d come than I was leaving .
The moment I did n’t have the roof of the tunnel over my head , I took to the air .
I was high enough that I could see the entirety of Tattletale ’s realm , and where the city was bleeding into and through the mountains and forest to connect to other areas and the remainder of the megalopolis .   
I could see the boats on the water , like ants on an anthill , the black smoke , and the patches that gleamed with a forced luster .
It was n’t home .   
The worst of the fucking racists were gone , I had to hope , but the rest of the bad stuff seemed to be firmly entrenched in there .
I drew my phone from my pocket .   
I put the one earbud in , some music to drown out my thoughts while I steadied myself .
Me : 

Did you record all of that ?
A dark shape flew within a foot of me .   
For an instant , I thought it might have been one of the small birds that had arrived with Tattletale .
It was a sphere , consisting of several layers like an onion , alternating blue and red .   
The lens was a white circle , and as it roved , the layers moved to accommodate it looking around .   
Several fins extended out from the two most external layers , moving independently of one another to correct its position and hold eerily steady in the wind .
“
Recorded it all , ” the camera said , Kenzie ’s voice with some synthesizer mixing things up .
“ You got the sound , too ?
”
“
Of course , ” she said .   
“
Can I listen to it ?
”
“
No , ” I said .   
“
Not yet .   
Not when Tattletale operates the way she does .   
I ’ve got a long flight back .   
Any way you can replay the conversation for me so I can listen to it on the way back , and figure out if anything needs redacting ?
”
“ Without listening in ?
”
“
I ’d prefer if you listened in with the rest of the group .   
I ’m
concerned Tattletale can say something to me that affects one of you .   
She touched on some personal subjects , and I need to think about how much I ’m comfortable sharing .
”
“ Not a problem .   
Give me a minute .
”
I started my flight home , the camera flying alongside me .
I expected the camera to speak , when Kenzie was ready .   
I was a little surprised when it came through my ear - bud instead .
⊙ “ … you ’re bound to find a position somewhere eventually .   
Some cape will die in battle , and a seat will open up for you and you ’ll do fine .   
Or retire .   
After what your sister did to you , nobody would blame you .
”
I was still , listening to this .   
The others , Rain excepted , were gathered around the table .   
The library had picnic tables and benches strewn around , and some patio chairs for reading outdoors when the weather was good .
They had arranged themselves on a mixture of seats , with Ashley standing .   
Kenzie ’s laptop was sitting on a patio table , with Rain watching in through a halting , low - res webcam .
I ’d been periodically pausing the conversation , to fill in gaps with basic knowledge and context , but I left things alone for this one .
“
Do what any self - respecting twenty - one year old would do after failing to get into university , get a job waitressing or making hero sandwiches .   
Talk to your kids about the old Glory days .
”
“ Pause , ” I said .
The recording paused .
“
It took her a little while to get around to it , but it ’s worth stressing that this is who she is .   
I thought about redacting these parts , but I think it ’s important you know .   
The PRT thought she had the ability to sense weak points , primarily psychological ones .   
I agree with that assessment .
”
“
Your sister is Panacea , right ? ”
Chris asked .
I tensed a bit .
“ Chris , ” Sveta said .   
“
I think Victoria would prefer it if we glossed over that part .
”
“
It ’s for context .   
Like she just said , it stresses who Tattletale is .
”
“
She was a healer , ” I said .   
“ Tattletale ’s words caught her in a bad way at a bad time .   
Two months later , she had a mental breakdown .   
In part because of what Tattletale said .   
She put me in the hospital .   
Let ’s leave it at that .
”
“ Resume recording , ” Kenzie said .
“ And
what happens to Cedar Point , in this hypothetical ?
”
“ I ’m talking reality , Vicky .   
It ’s going to be the same thing that was going to happen before the villains turned up , and it ’s the same thing that ’s going to happen when and if you try and summarily fail to change things there .
”
“ Pause , ” I said .   
“
She likes to act like she knows what ’s going to happen , but it ’s worth saying she can be surprised .   
She was surprised at the bank .   
She and her team pulled it off regardless , but … she was surprised by my arrival , and by my sister being there .
”
“
Worth keeping in mind , ” Tristan said .   
“
If we wind up fighting her .
”
“ I ’m giving you all the info I can , so you can make an informed decision , ” I said .   
“ Resume .
”
“
-The area struggles , it withers , it becomes irrelevant .   
This is n’t your fight , and it ’s not what you ’re equipped to do .   
You hit things .   
You-
” Kenzie ’s voice chimed in with a cheerful , synthesized , “ Redacted !
”
“ Pause .   
Redacted because it ’s a weak point , ” I said .   
“ Power - related .
”
“ I think I know , ” Sveta said .   
“ If this makes you doubt Victoria at all , I hope me vouching for her helps .
”
“
It helps , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Not that I was doubting her .
”
“ Resume , ” I said .
“ -I
know you do n’t belong in Cedar Point , and
I know you ’re just going to cause headaches for me and the actual heroes if you try anything .   
It ’s not your skillset , it ’s not your powerset .
”
There was a small chime as a message appeared in the corner of the laptop .   
The recording paused in response to the message appearing .
Rain :   
Is it ours ?
“
That ’s a conversation I want to have shortly , ” I said .   
“ Powers .
”
“
I ’m looking forward to this , ” Chris said .
Behind him , pacing a little , Ashley smiled .
Right .
“ Resume , ”
I said .
“ Redacted , redacted , ” Kenzie ’s synthesized voice played .   
Then Tattletale ’s voice came up again .   
“
I ’m one of the major players now .   
The other major players call me for a hint when they ’re stuck on something .   
I ’m wealthy , well - positioned , and safe .   
I ’m now sharing the love and bringing some of that security , stability , and safety to others , in my very , very roundabout way .   
It ’s part of why I ’m having this conversation with you .
”
“ Stop , ” I said .   
The recording paused , and Kenzie hit a keyboard shortcut to close the window .   
“
Everything that followed was small talk , some threats from her , and stuff about my sister
I do n’t want to get into .   
That ’s Tattletale .   
That ’s how she sees the world .   
I do believe her when she says there ’s no good way to break into this scene .   
There are a lot of people who want to hold their positions and the power they ’ve taken for themselves , and when you ’ve cornered them , they ’re going to call people like Tattletale for backup .
”
“ Or worse , ” Ashley said .   
That was apparently what she ’d fixated on , during the earlier part of the conversation .
“ Or worse .   
People who are good at the roles they ’ve taken on , well - proven by years of experience , people who can and will casually destroy you .
”
“
No matter what we do , ” Sveta said , “ We ’re going to run into trouble .   
So we do nothing or we plan for it .
”
“ We plan for it , ” Tristan said .   
“ Ashley and I were talking about this .   
Something that might fit our niche , and gives key members of our team what they ’re looking for .
”
He looked at Kenzie as he said the last bit , and Kenzie visibly perked up .
“ You have a game plan ?
” I asked .
“
The start of one , ” Tristan said .   
“
Maybe .
”
I thought about that for a moment .   
The others exchanged a few words , and a chime signaled Rain ’s comment for the convo – he and Tristan had apparently exchanged some messages about the plan .
“
Did you guys bring costume stuff ?
”
I asked , when there was an opening .   
“
Those of you that have it ?
”
That got me confirmation from about half of the group .
“ I have spare , basic masks for those that need them , ” I said .   
“
I also have the start of my team outline written up on my laptop .   
What do you guys say we move to an area with some elbow room , you can show me enough of your powers that I know what to put in the document , and we talk about what you ’ve got in mind ? ”








“
Hey , Victoria , you ’re strong right ?
” Kenzie asked .
“ Kind of , ” I said .   
“ I ’d be worried about breaking whatever it is
I ’m
handling .
”
“
It ’s pretty durable .
”
I thought about my forcefield .   
“ I totaled the last car I lifted .
”
“ I brought things , and I thought maybe Chris could lift some or Tristan could , but Tristan does n’t think he ’s strong enough and Chris does n’t want to .
”
She turned stick out her tongue at Chris .
“ Limited duration , ” Chris said .
“ I can take a look , where is this ?
”
I asked Kenzie .
“
At the street .   
Black van .   
I ’ll show you .
”
“
Yeah , that ’d help .   
I ’ll probably have questions .
”
I turned to the others , pointing at the treeline .   
“ If you guys want to head over that way , stop at the rocky outcropping on the hill .   
We ’ll meet you there .
”
Kenzie walked with me .   
She was wearing black overalls and a pink tank top , a red apple clip in her hair , and red sneakers .   
Her hair was in much the same style as before , but the buns were set higher .
I paid more attention to her fashion choice because so much about it seemed deliberate , from color scheme to running theme .   
During the last meeting it had been a star on her dress , partially on her shirt , and in her hair .
“
My dad gave me a ride today , because he needs to buy a suit and more work clothes , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Please do n’t judge me too harshly if he acts really lame .
”
“ I wo n’t , ” I said .   
“
You said Tristan and Chris could have helped .   
Tristan has increased strength ?
”
“ Just a little .   
Very very little .
”
“ I guess we ’ll find out soon .
”
“ Sveta could have helped too
, we think , she ’s really strong if she uses her real body , but it would have meant dragging it and that would have hurt the grass .
”
“ How big is this thing ?
”
“
I ’ll show you , ” she said .   
She sprinted the last little way to the sleek van that was parked on the street in front of the library , hopping up to the passenger side window , clinging to the bottom edge of the open window so she could stick her head in .   
The back door of the van popped open , and Kenzie ’s father stepped out , walking around the van to the sidewalk .
He was almost as meticulous in appearance as Kenzie .   
He was very lean , with pronounced cheekbones and a long face that was made to look longer by the goatee that extended an inch from his chin .   
He wore a short - sleeved work shirt with a pinstripe pattern on it , and slim jeans that looked like they had cost a pretty penny .   
Shoes , belt , and watch , all expensive - looking .
The beard and his longer hair were n’t as tidy as Kenzie was , but I was hardly about to judge , given how it was probably a day off for him
and he was sitting in the sun .
“ Dad , this is Victoria .   
She ’s the coach I was talking about .   
Victoria , this is my dad .
”
“
Hi , Mr …
”   
I extended a hand .
“ Julien Martin , ” he said .   
He shook my hand .   
Both handshake and his tone were stiff , but it was a different kind of stiffness than I was used to seeing in Dean ’s family .   
I was well aware of how easily I ’d slotted him onto that same mental shelf .
“
You can call him Julien , ” Kenzie said .
“ Nice to meet you .   
What do you do ?
”
“ Realty .
”
“
Dad only got into realty a year and a half ago , but he ’s really good at both the buying and selling sides of things .   
I do n’t really get it all , but his boss seemed pretty happy with him .   
You got a promotion , right ?
”
“ I did .
”
“
He ’s doing it ethically , too , which is so important , with so many shady people out there .
”
“
I ’m trying , ” he said .
“ I can respect that , ” I said .   
“
Thanks for bringing Kenzie out this far , and for bringing her stuff .
”
Kenzie rolled her eyes .   
“
We should go take a look so we do n’t keep the others waiting .
”
Julien followed us around to the back of the van , standing back while we opened the doors .   
A black box that was a bit larger than a washing machine was sitting in there , strapped down ten ways from Sunday , to keep it from sliding around when the vehicle moved .   
More boxes were sitting at either side of the van , with straps to keep them flush against the wall , but they were n’t any larger than a backpack or suitcase .
“ We got the van because some of my stuff is hard to move , ” Kenzie said .
“
Okay , ” I said .   
The box had a metal frame around the edges , with a crossbar running diagonally along each face .   
“
What do I need to know ?
”
“
Pick it up and move it .
”
“
It ’s tinkertech , right ?
”
“ It is .
”
“
Is there a chance of a misfire if it ’s moved in the wrong way , if something ’s crushed or broken ?
”
“
No . ”
“
Will I hurt anything if it ’s turned on its side ?
”
“
No , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Hm .   
It ’s best if you do n’t turn it upside down .
”
“
Where should I grab it , to best carry it ?
”
“ Geeez , ” Kenzie said .   
“
It ’s not going to blow up or anything .   
Or if it did , it would n’t be a big enough explosion to hurt anyone .   
Not unless very specific conditions were met .
”
“
Right , ” I said .   
I had an issue with my power , where I was n’t sure I trusted the forcefield to simply hold the box and not crush or dig into it .   
It was only about a minute of flying to get to where I wanted to go , but even if everything went according to plan , I was worried that handling the box for more than a couple of seconds would leave handprints or gouges in it .
While I investigated , Kenzie climbed in beside me , peering at the box and watching me .
“ Give me some space ?
” I asked .
Kenzie grabbed some smaller things on her way out .
It took a few minutes , but I unclipped the straps that were securing the box in place , and laid them across the ground .   
I lifted the box , and set it down on the straps .   
I connected them , wrapping them around the box , then slid it around so I could reach the ones at the back .   
There was a ramp built into the truck , and I could see where the box could slide along the tracks , but it seemed like more of a hassle to use the ramp and unload that way .
“
How dangerous is this team business going to be ?
”
Julien asked , behind me .
“ Dad , ” Kenzie protested .   
“
Do n’t embarrass me .
”
“ If I thought it was going to be a serious danger , I would n’t be helping , ” I said , still working on the straps .   
“
But I ca n’t guarantee anything .
”
I fastened the straps , then hauled the entire thing out , forcefield up , gripping the box .   
It thudded against the street .   
Dense .
“
Is it a problem ?
”
I asked Julien .
“
It ’s not a problem , ” Kenzie said , firm .   
“
I can handle myself .   
I ’ve trained more than a lot of heroes , because I did a year going to all the practice events and stuff .
”
“
I ’m more interested in what your dad has to say .   
I do n’t want to step on toes , and your parents get the last word .
”
“
It ’s fine , ” Julien said .   
“ If it was n’t this , she would be doing something else .   
I prefer this team idea .
”
“ You should , ” Kenzie huffed .
“
Do you need to be picked up ?
”
“
Yes , please .   
In … ?
”
Kenzie looked at me .
“
Two hours ?
” I asked .   
“ Is that okay ?
”
“
It ’s fine , ” her dad said .   
He still had that tone , which came across curt , inflexible .   
I had a hard time imagining him as a salesman .   
Accountant , maybe .
“ Before you do anything , can you go to the train station ?   
Rain had to take the train and he ’s running late .   
Bring him here ?
” Kenzie asked .
Her dad frowned .
“ Please , ” Kenzie said .
“ Where am I going ?
” he asked .
“ Give me your phone , I ’ll put it in there .
” While they fussed , I checked and fixed the remainder of the straps .
“
I ’ll be right back , ” I said .
The straps served to let me hold the box without actually holding it .   
I flew , holding the length of straps that I ’d wound together and attached at the tail end .   
The box made for unwieldy flying , swinging below me .
Could the forcefield potentially claw through them ?   
Yes .   
I hoped I ’d be able to see it before it managed to succeed .
I flew in the direction
I ’d sent the others , leaving Kenzie behind .
My phantom self gripped the length of straps , scratched , squeezed , and twisted it , periodically making the ten foot length of cords bend in unusual shapes .
I had n’t interacted with it much .   
I had n’t seen the limits of its intelligence or lack thereof .   
This one minute of flying might have even been the longest period I ’d properly used my strength in two years .
I sighted the others , sitting on the rocks and talking .   
I dropped low , and I set the box down on the ground .   
Even with the care I was taking , it made a noise on landing .
“
Wow , ” Tristan said .   
“
How heavy is that thing ?
”
“
No idea , ” I said .   
“ If I had to guess , maybe three hundred and fifty pounds ?
”
“ I can see why she has a hard time moving those things around .
”
“
She described them as being bigger , ” Chris said .   
“
Others , I think .   
I think they start at that size and get larger .
”
“
Did her dad leave ?
” Sveta asked .
“
Not yet , ” I said .   
“ They ’re figuring out logistics .   
He ’s going to go pick up Rain at the station .   
Be right back .
” I flew over to where Kenzie and her dad were .   
Kenzie ’s dad was in the driver ’s seat , and Kenzie was closing the rear doors .   
A series of bags and boxes were unloaded , all packed together .
As I landed , her dad pulled away .   
Kenzie raised a hand in a wave .
I was aware of the lack of a wave in response .   
From the way she lowered her hand and glanced at me , Kenzie was too .
“
Want to fly over ?
” I asked .
Her eyes lit up with excitement as she nodded .
There were very few people in the world who did n’t like flying .
It was , in a way , almost as much of a pain to bring Kenzie , two cases and two boxes without my strength active , as it had been to move the one cube .   
I ended up lifting her by the straps at the back of her overalls , my hand also wrapped around the strap of one bag , while Kenzie held other things .
We arrived at the hill with the rocks .   
There was light overgrowth , a fairly loose distribution of trees for the fact that it was untamed wilderness , and thick grass .   
A surveying team had passed through at one point , and they had disturbed earth here and there , felled a few trees , and spray painted the face of one of the larger rocks before leaving .
A bit of a shame , but I could understand the need for a quick and easy label .   
No minerals or stone of any particular value here .
Chris , wearing his headphones again , was wearing what looked like the same shorts as he had worn at the meeting , and a different t - shirt .   
He was examining the box , while keeping at least two feet away from it at all times .   
He had a bag with him , a travelers’ backpack that was packed full , but he ’d put it down .
“ You do n’t have to keep your distance , ” Kenzie said .   
“
It ’s not dangerous .
”
“
It ’s tinkertech .   
It ’s science that gets at least some of its functionality from interdimensional fuckery , built by cooperation between you and the unfathomable , menacing thing that chose you as its host .
”
“
It ’s a camera , Chris .   
It records and projects .
”
“
It ’s a camera built with collaboration between you and a unknowable , violence - driven multiversal horror .
”
“
My multiversal horror is pretty tame , I think .   
She just likes to build things and gather information , ”   
Kenzie pressed buttons on the side of the box .   
A triangle between reinforcing bars lit up .
A hologram appeared a number of feet away .   
A potbellied rat with a crooked nose .
“ …
And you ’re using it to make cartoons , ” Chris said .
“ Plump Rat King , ” Sveta said .   
“
Some of the kids at the hospital liked that one .
”
“
It ’s okay , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Only the first season was really any good .
”
“
What ’s it good for ?
”
Ashley asked .   
She was taking things a step further than Chris’ wearing of the same shorts .   
She wore the same dress she had worn at the meeting , the damage at the corner mended imperfectly .   
One of the straps , I realized , had been damaged and patched , but her hair masked much of it .   
She had a black mask in her hand , but she had n’t put it on .
“ Stuff .   
Loads of stuff .   
I ’ll show you some later , ” Kenzie said .   
She started opening boxes .
Tristan , much like Kenzie , was unpacking a bag .   
His costume was armor .   
It struck a balance between function and appearance , but it looked like it was a pretty good quality .   
Each segment was framed with goat ’s heads and horns , spirals and ridges .   
Where it was n’t brushed metal , things were painted or tinted red or light red .   
He saw me looking and smiled .
“ Byron is the fish theme , then ?
” I asked .
“ Water as much as fish .   
Yeah , ” Tristan said .
“ You have some kind of superstrength , right ?
”
“
A very small amount .   
Helps when you ’re wearing armor as heavy as this , or when you ’re using a power that can make heavy things .
”
“ Seems like a good place to get us started , ” I said .
Tristan turned around , seating himself firmly on the sloped ground , his armor partially unpacked and arranged beside him .   
Some bits were already fastened into place on his arms and legs , over a bodysuit that seemed designed to go between him and his armor .
He held up his hand , and produced three motes of orange - red light .   
As each one moved through the air , it left a trail behind it , like the afterimage of a sparkler waved through the darkness .   
They traced a circle and as the moving points of light connected to the end of each trail , a shape came to life .   
A discus , with a slight peak on one side .
I extended a hand , and he passed it to me .
Dense , heavy , very solid .   
Matter creation .
“
You can throw it , ” he said .
I threw it .   
It was n’t as aerodynamic as a frisbee , but it did catch the air .   
It wobbled mid - flight and veered off course , crashing into a tree before disappearing into a patch of grass .
Tristan was already making something else .   
Twelve or more motes of light traced the shape .   
“ Requires a bit of concentration , I can rush it or force it to come into being early , but you get weirdness like … this .
”
It materialized .   
A hammer or a mace , long - handled .   
The weirdness was in how the shape finalized its form , drawing pretty creative curves and hooks .   
Spikes , horns , thorns , and other slightly curved growths stood out .   
It looked unbalanced .
“
Are they permanent ?
” I asked .
“ They can be .   
Depends if I keep the sparks alive or not .   
I can create a lot of sparks , but it requires more time , more concentration .
”
“
What ’s the difference between keeping it alive or not ?
” I asked .
“
Ah , ” he said .   
He pushed himself to his feet , shifting his footing to make sure he would n’t slide down the hill .   
He held out the mace , and started to form the motes for another .   
He rushed this one even more than he had the last .   
The shape was more unwieldy , less balanced .   
“ Byron , you want to help with demonstrations today , or do you want to be left alone ?
”
Tristan blurred , features distorting , his eyes flaring with the same light as the sparks had .   
The light turned blue , and then he was Byron , wearing a hooded sweatshirt and jeans .
One of the two maces exploded into a spray of water .   
Sveta made a noise of surprise , and Chris , still mostly fixated on examining Kenzie ’s cube , jumped back from the cube in surprise .
Byron turned his head so the backspray hit him in the side of the face , rather than right in the center of it .   
He dropped the still - intact mace he held with his other hand .
“
Hi Byron , ” Kenzie said .
“
Hi , ” I added my greeting to Kenzie
’s .   
“ We have n’t formally met .
”
“ We have n’t .   
I got the basics , ” he said .
“
So I gathered .
”
“
This is a terrible idea , ” he said .   
“
Tristan being involved , this team concept , the potential for disaster , and this thing with Tattletale ?
”
“ I do n’t see anyone changing their mind .   
Mrs. Yamada could n’t convince them , I do n’t think I can .   
If they ’re going to do this or something like this , is n’t it better that they do it smart and informed ?
”
“ I do n’t know , ” he said .   
“
But if you ’re enabling them , you should know you own a share of what happens .
”
“
I do n’t think that ’s fair , ” Sveta said .
“
It might be fair , ” I said .
“ My voice does n’t matter either .   
I tried , nobody listens .   
Maybe I own a bit of what happens for not trying harder to stop Tristan from going forward with this .
”
“
You sound pretty certain something bad is going to happen .
”
“ I was there for all the therapy sessions , even if I did n’t participate , ” he said .   
He looked at the others .   
“
Do n’t worry , I ’m not going to say anything .   
But I am going to say , again , this is a trainwreck waiting to happen .
”
“
We got it , ” Chris said .   
“
Saying it over and over does n’t change anything .
”
“
Be kind , Chris , ” Sveta said .   
“
There ’s a lot playing into Byron ’s concerns .
”
Byron shook his head .   
He glanced at me .
“
You need anything , while we ’re talking ?
” I asked .
He shook his head .   
“
No .   
Um .   
You seem alright , so … be safe .   
Be wary .   
And for the record , since you ’re going to ask … ”
He showed me his power .   
Motes of light , like
Tristan ’s , blue .   
He drew them in the air , two expanding , abstract shapes , not closed like Tristan ’s had been .   
He positioned them so there was one on either side of him , then clenched his fist .   
The lines that were drawn became water , buckets worth , spraying out in the direction the lines had been drawn .   
He had drawn them out as expanding spirals , and the resulting water flew out in circular sprays .
“
You can use me if you need to clean up , Tristan , ” Byron said .   
“ I ’ll do the quick swaps if you need them .
”
The water was still spraying when Byron blurred , features distorting and smearing together , the two lighted eyes peering through the shadows between folds and smears , going from blue to orange - red .
One of the sprays of water lost all of its oomph , the remaining water striking the ground to flow through grass and between rocks .   
The other diagram became a solid object , a wheel spikier and cruder than what Tristan had made .   
It hit the ground and stuck there .
The water that Byron ’s power had produced rained down on us for several seconds .
“
It ’s not going to hurt the box ?
” Chris asked .
“
Nope , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Waterproofed just in case Byron visited .   
It was good to see you , Byron , by the way .   
I hope to prove you wrong .
”
“
Yeah , ” Sveta said .   
“
That ’s a good way of putting it , Kenzie .
”
Tristan ’s face was at an angle that saw him looking down at the ground .   
At first I thought he was trying to keep the water out of his face .   
Then , as he changed the angle of his head a little , I saw his face .
“
For the record , ” Tristan said , “ If it ’s my two hours and I ask you a question and then pass the baton , I ’d really appreciate it if you did n’t take up extra time and use it to try and sabotage me .
”
“ I did say hi to him , ” I said .
Tristan shrugged .   
“
He did n’t have to say all that .   
He ’s quick to say there ’s a problem
but he does n’t suggest alternatives .   
He whines about the circumstances but he wo n’t attend the therapy and he does n’t want to work on figuring out better courses of action .   
It pisses me off sometimes , especially when he elbows into my time to make what I ’m trying to accomplish harder .
”
His tone was hard .   
Pissed off seemed like an apt description .   
I ’d seen Tristan , casual and smiling some before he ’d changed , and now this felt like a complete , sudden shift .
It was easy to forget that he was in there while Byron was out here , feeling things , thinking , his mood changing during that short conversation .
I could see the expressions of others .   
The sympathy on Sveta ’s face , the tilt of Chris’ head .
Ashley looked especially focused and attentive , her pacing around the hill having come to a stop .   
One of her hands was at her hair , pushing it back out of her face , the water helping it stay there .
“
It seems like hard feelings are inevitable , ” I said .
“
Yeah , ” Tristan said .   
He looked away .   
“
I can keep my shapes ‘ alive’ .   
If they ’re still alive when I change , they become water .   
If they are n’t , they ’re there to stay .   
Same for Byron ’s water .   
It ’s effective if he makes water , sloshes it over someone , and then changes , to make it solid .   
We ’ve tagged a good dozen villains that way .
”
“
A dozen is a really good number for a teenage hero .
”
“
Yeah , ” Tristan said .
“
You ’re pretty lucky , getting a name that fitting for a power like that .
”
“ Constellations forming rock and water ?
” Tristan asked .   
He snorted air through his nostrils .   
“
Want to know the hilarious thing ?
”
“ I do , ” I said .   
I was n’t sure whatever he was going to say
was ‘ hilarious’ , given his tone , but I ’d hoped today would be a lighter endeavor , and any humor would help .
“ We were n’t even rock and water , originally .   
Reach bought the name from the last Capricorn .   
She got wounded in battle and she retired .   
Win - win .   
We got settled into the role , got our name , our armor , our brand , and … power changed to match .
”
“
That ’s really interesting , ” I said .   
“
There ’s a lot of potential there .
”
“
There is .   
Absolutely .   
And not all of it ’s good ,
” Tristan said .
“
But some of it is , ” Sveta said .
“
Some of it is , yeah , ” Tristan said .   
He offered her a small smile .
I could see the concerted effort he was making to pull out of the funk .   
A few words from his brother and he was upset enough that it showed in his tone and the direction of what he was talking about .
Tricky , that kind of negativity sitting just under the surface .
“ Sveta , ” I said .   
Change of topic .   
“
I ’m guessing you ’ve worked on control enough that you feel
okay letting loose in limited ways ?
”
“
Kind of , ” she said .   
“ I do n’t want to go all - out in a combat situation .   
I do n’t want to do anything that would risk people getting hurt .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .
“ I figured I would mostly stay in the suit .   
I can do this …
”
She did n’t touch or move anything external , but the joints of her elbow shifted , and the forearm and hand dropped .   
Ten or so tendrils extended between elbow and forearm , like a muscle with gaps between strands .
She moved it , tendrils bending , flinging her hand and the attached segment of arm out fifty feet .   
She tried to grab a branch , missed it , grabbed another , and seized it , before pulling her body to follow .   
I saw her turn her head away as she pulled herself through the intervening twigs and leaves .
She twisted around , pointed a hand , and used tendrils to push her fist out .
She seized the wheel that Byron had left embedded in the earth , and pulled herself to it .
There was a bit of gracelessness to the landing , her pants leg and the side of her body rubbing against the grass , a few clumps of earth flying , but it served to put her in our midst again .   
She wobbled as she stood and Tristan
and I caught her between us .
She made a small ‘ phew’ sound .
“
You ’re made of grappling hooks , basically , ” Chris said .   
Kenzie , sitting on her box , stuck out her toe to jab Chris in the shoulder .
“
I can get things for my body .   
Weld and I were talking about getting a second body for cape things .   
If I had hooks I could unfold
I could more reliably grab things .   
And I ’ll get better with practice , ” Sveta said .   
“
And I really want extra shielding for my joints because they ’re the easiest part to break , and I do n’t want to have to send it out to be repaired and be unable to walk or do things in the meantime .
”
“
What happens if the suit gets broken ?
” I asked .   
“
As in broken enough that it does n’t keep you contained ?
”
“
Um .   
I have a collapsed hamster ball in here .   
I can spit it out , unfold it , shove myself in there and bring the lid behind me .   
It ’s a bit cramped , it ’s not the biggest , and it might not always work , but I ’ve also been working hard at keeping myself under control .
”
I suppressed a wince .   
Sveta had worked hard for as long as I ’d known her , and I knew that the anxiety was tied into the lack of control in a feedback loop , and that her being so much more confident and happy would mean she had more control , but all it took was one bad incident .
“
Workable , ” I said .   
“
We ’d have to be really , really careful .
”
“
Absolutely , ” she said , with dead seriousness .   
“
The way I see it , my body is pretty hardy .   
To break containment , it would take something that would maim an ordinary person .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
But if they think you ’re durable , they might not hold back .
We ’d address that when it came to it .
“
Alright , ” I said .   
“
So , my line of thinking was that instead of explaining , we ’d do a little bit of a team exercise .
”
I heard a faint groan from Chris .
“
It should be fun , and it should be relatively low - key , ” I said .   
“
We split everyone into teams of three , and we play a small game of capture the flag , here .
”
“
See , that ’s playing dirty , ” Tristan said .   
“
You ’re playing into my love for competition , here .
”
“
It ’s fun , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I really like this .
”
It seemed Kenzie could be counted on to be positive .   
I said , “ I ’m hoping it ’s fun .   
Does anyone else need to explain their powers or cover anything before we get into it ?   
I know what Ashley can do , unless something ’s changed .
”
Ashley shook her head .
“
We ’ll see you in action when we have our competition , then .   
That leaves Chris and Kenzie , kind of .
”
“ I ’ve got some things , ” Kenzie said .   
She opened a case .   
“ Two of these things I had as just - in - case things when I was a Ward .   
I got them fixed up recently , and I even made an improvement .   
Eye hook- ”
She pulled out a coil of metal .   
She stuck it on the corner of her cube , then held her phone in one hand , moving her thumb around .   
The coil unfurled , prehensile , and its tip unfolded from its teardrop shape .   
Three claws , extending from around a circular lens with a pupil .   
Kenzie moved her head and body in time with the movements of the thing .
The thing moved closer to me , until it was two feet from my face , the three claw - blades opening and closing a little .   
It blinked at me , shutter closing momentarily .
“
It was made to look through vents , to start with .   
it ’s delicate enough
it can turn screws and drill holes , and I can swap out the lens for others .   
And I ’ve got this flash gun too .
”
She held up something that looked like a child ’s toy , squat , blunt , with a lens on the front .
“
It ’s for when I had to get closer to the scene when I was with the Baltimore Wards .   
They wanted me to be able to protect myself and they wanted nonlethal .
”
“ What does it do ?
” I asked .
“ Makes light , ” she said .   
She aimed it off to the side and pulled the trigger .
It looked and sounded like a camera flash going off .
“ And the other stuff ?
”
“ Mask with a few settings , ” Kenzie said .   
She pulled out a high - tech mask , metal around the edges to give a general circular shape to the clear pane for her face , but she did n’t put it on .   
She held up a disc , then clipped it to the front of her overalls , so it was directly over the pocket at her chest .   
“
This is kind of a costume thing I have n’t finalized .
”
“
Good , ” I said .   
“ Great .
”
“ I transform , ” Chris said .   
“ Changer .
”
I made a motion for him to continue .
He sounded aggrieved , like it was my fault he had to explain at all , “
I do n’t know what else you want .   
I have a few different forms .   
They ’re inspired by my moods and mental states .
”
“ You give them names based on what mood or state they ’re from , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Like Creeping Anxiety and Wistful Distraction .
”
“
Yeah , ” Chris said .   
“
Look , the rest of you know .   
Explain .   
I ’m going to go change .
”
He grabbed his bag and hefted it over one shoulder , then began trudging uphill .
“ These forms reflect the feelings ?
” I asked .
“
Very much so , ” Sveta said .
“
It sounds like he has more than a few forms , ” I said .
“ Eight or more , as far as I ’ve counted , ” Kenzie said .   
“
He said a few , but I think he loses track .   
There ’s wiggle room in each form , too .   
It depends on a lot of factors .   
Diet , time since he last used a form , if he pushes for something in the middle .
”
“
He ’s strong , ” Ashley said .
“
He might be , ” Tristan said .
Kenzie continued to volunteer information .   
“
The forms tend to come with pretty heavy weakness .   
Anxiety is quick but fragile .   
That sort of thing .
”
“ I think I get it , ” I said .   
“
Can I ask why he ’s in the group ?
”
“
The drawbacks , ” Tristan said .
“ The fragility is n’t a drawback ?
” I asked .
“
It ’s one .   
He does n’t change all the way back .
”
“
What ?
” I asked .
Tristan explained , “ He changes to one , he gets a little taller , a little stronger , a little more sluggish .   
He changes to another , gets better eyes , ears …
”
“
Thus the headphones , ” Kenzie said .
“ … and less responsive in hand - eye coordination to go with it .   
He tries to balance , but lately it ’s been getting worse .
”
“
What happens if he does n’t change ?
”
“
The body stays the same , ” Sveta said .   
“
He does n’t change physically .
”
“
Which is good .
”
“
But he does n’t change mentally either .   
He says he ca n’t tap those emotions he ’s not using , he ca n’t think as clearly , his thoughts go in circles .
”
“ Lose - lose , ” I said .
“
Something like that , ” Ashley said .
I could hear Chris’ approach , now .   
The sound of branches breaking underfoot , the rustling of under- and over - growth .
He ’d grown .   
He ’d shucked off his clothes and he ’d donned what looked like an oversized pair of shorts in a coarse cloth .   
They had to have taken up most of the bag
’s space .   
He was twelve feet tall , with skewed proportions .   
Large legs , large around the middle , large hands , all with coarse hair .   
His shoulders seemed somewhat narrow , his neck long , his head only a little larger than normal , with faintly pronounced tusks .   
His hair , wild before , was just a bit longer than it had been .
“
He chose one of the more pleasant looking forms , ” Kenzie said , cheerful .   
She grabbed her stuff .
How in the fuck was I supposed to make someone like Chris marketable ?   
How was I supposed to wrangle Ashley or handle Tristan ’s issue ?
“
Twenty minutes , ” Tristan said .   
“
Then he changes back .   
We should hurry .
”
Capture the flag .   
Right .   
A part of me wished I had n’t brought it up .   
I could have left things at this , with powers explained and demonstrated in brief , and then I could have taken a few days to think .
I needed a few days to think , so feelings would n’t be hurt , damage would n’t be done .
I did n’t have it .   
I ’d lose too much stock with these guys if I changed my mind .   
Chris and Ashley especially .
“
Who wants to be team leaders ?
” I asked .
Tristan raised one hand .   
Ashley raised another .
“ Ashley , you want to pick first ?
” I asked .
“ Kenzie .
”
“ Woo ! ”
Kenzie cheered .
“ Sveta , ” Tristan said .   
“
You ’d be my second pick , after Rain .   
Weld fan club .
”
“ Chris , ” Ashley said .   
She pulled on her mask .   
It was v - shaped , covering the nose , ears , and eyes , leaving just a hint of her eyebrows visible above .
“
You guys set up over there , opposite side of the hill , then , ” I said .   
Ashley and the two youngest members of the team .
“
You ’re filling in for Rain ?
”
Tristan asked me .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
I ’m mostly interested in seeing how you guys operate , so I ’ll mostly stick to playing defense and keeping an eye on things .
”
“
Alright .   
I do n’t think that ’ll be a problem , ” he said .
I was n’t so sure .   
I could see the way he set his jaw , before he pulled his horned helmet on .   
I had an idea of his disposition already .   
I could see the look of Ashley ’s eyes behind her mask , too .   
She wanted to be leader , by the looks of things , and that meant she had something to prove .   
I saw Chris as the giant , properly smiling for the first time since I ’d met him , as he looked back over one shoulder , lumbering away .   
It made me more concerned , rather than less .
Sveta took my hand , squeezing it .   
Off to the side , Tristan was drawing something out of motes of light , ten feet tall and twenty feet wide .   
A wall .
I ’d wanted to test them , to see how they functioned as discrete units , and possibly to highlight difficulties .
The more I saw , the less sure I was that these guys were equipped to handle even a friendly contest .   
There were so many messy parts to this .   
Above all else , the ones with the power seemed least suited to wield it .
“
Believe in us ,
” Sveta said , her voice soft .
I wanted to .   
I really did .








“ You want a game plan ?
” Tristan said .   
“
Do you mean for here or for the big picture ?
” I was thinking big picture , I thought ,   I have doubts right now and a plan would help .
Without voicing that , I said , “ Here , but I ’m open to hearing about either .   
If you have something in mind .
”
“ I want to wait on the big picture stuff
so we can include Rain into the discussion .   
He and I chat regularly , and he ’s heard some , but Ashley and I were talking while we waited for you
and there ’s bits to discuss .   
Comfort levels .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .   
“
We ’ll focus on this for now .
”
“
I ’m in charge , then ?
” Tristan asked .
“ If Sveta is okay with it , you can give it a shot .
”
“
I ’m
okay with it , ” Sveta said .
He made a small amused sound , his face obscured by his helmet , his hands busy adjusting the fit of his armor as he paced .  
“
There was a time I thought I might end up being in charge of Reach .  
Things fell through before then .   
I do n’t know if my current mindset works for it , but let ’s give this a try .
”
I had my own bag , which I ’d brought with me .  
My computer , masks , and the flags , one red and one blue .  
I fished out the flags , holding both in one hand , and put on one of the masks .
“ Victoria , you and I are on defense , then , ” he said .  
“ Ashley is going to go hard offense , that ’s who she is , and I do n’t see Chris holding back .  
Sveta , you ’re going on the attack .   
You loop around , go the long way if you have to .  
You might have to dodge Kenzie , but I think you can manage that okay .  
It ’s only her hook thing and flash gun .
”
“
Sounds like a plan , ” Sveta said .
“
Alright , ” I said .
“ I think the benefit here is that we all have some experience , ” he said .
“ Kind of , ” Sveta said .
“ They ’re young .   
Ashley too , in a weird way .   
They ’re led by Ashley and we know how she thinks .   
I can put my confidence in you , Sveta , if you ’re going for their flag .
”
“
I hope I deserve it .
”
“
I ’m confident in myself and
my ability to hold up against a two - person rush , assuming that ’s what they do , and
I know you ’ve got a background , Victoria .
”
“
Yeah .   
Confidence goes before the fall , though .   
I think one of the things I regret most in the past is my overconfidence .
”
“
This is just an exercise .   
If I ’m wrong on this , I ’ll own it .   
Let me plant our flag and get my stuff to adjust my armor , I ’ll be right with you .
”
As he said it , another wall materialized behind us .  
A fort with ten foot walls was slowly forming .  
Tristan was n’t even focusing that much on the construction , attention - wise .   
He took the flag before walking off .
I had intentionally chosen a less level area .  
We were on a hill , playing on a bit of a slope , roughly a ten degree decline with taller grass , weeds , and some pebbly dirt covering the area .  
Some trees and rocks dotted the space between where their group would set up and where we would .
I had a few reasons for choosing the area .  
Part of it played off something I had experienced with New Wave .  
The team had always been split between the fliers and the people on the ground .  
Me , Aunt Sarah , Crystal and Eric had all been airborne , while my Uncle Neil , Mom , and Dad had all been landbound .  
It created a dilemma in logistics , and this slightly sloped ground and uneven terrain emphasized that logistics in a way that having to go through and around buildings might in the city .
Sveta functionally had a mover ability , I was n’t sure about Chris’ capabilities , and Damsel and Rain both had some capabilities in that realm .  
Supposedly .  
I wanted to see how the more mobile members of the group worked in coordination with the others .
It was interesting that Tristan had picked both Sveta and me .  
We were both mobile and Tristan was n’t .  
Ashley ’s team had three people on foot .
Another reason for this particular location was Rain ’s power .  
It helped him keep his balance , and that was supposedly the extent of it .   
When he arrived , I wanted to see if it factored in here .
Finally , there was the fact that it put us out of the way .  
No bystanders , no property to damage .
Kenzie had her head down , her attention on her phone .  
Ashley and Chris were both smiling .  
All three were talking .  
I waited a short bit for them to finish .
“
I ’m so unbelievably nervous , ” Sveta said .
I glanced at her , and confirmed that Tristan had stepped away , rummaging in his bag .  
He was out of earshot .
“ I definitely hear you on that , ” I said .
“ I really want this exercise to work somehow , like Tristan said , but for different reasons .  
The way you were brought in , you might have come in looking for the bad , and it ’s …
it ’s not all bad .   
Really .   
I always wanted a team and the idea of finding one and fitting myself to that team with all of my problems , it seemed impossible or far away .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
You talked about it in the hospital .   
That you ’d talked to Mrs. Yamada and other people about how , putting aside all your issues , you wanted to be a hero .
”
“
And I wanted a boyfriend , and I wanted to be functional again , and I wanted friends , ” she said , staring off at the other three .   
“
And I have almost all of it , but I feel like it could slip out of my grasp if things go wrong .   
If this goes wrong .   
I do n’t know what I can do if that happens .   
I ’m worried this is going to be a disaster , and that ’s making me so anxious .
”
“
What can I do ?
” I asked .   
“ I do n’t want you to be unhappy .
”
“
Like I said before , I really want you to believe in us here .   
I want you to give us a chance .   
Even if this is bad to start .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .
“
And-
I ’m sorry
if this is pushing a line or if you have reasons , but do n’t be so stiff ?
”
She sounded so uncertain as she said it .   
I drew in a deep breath and smiled at her .
“
I ’m the one with a prosthetic body .   
We ’re friends , right ? ”   
She smiled , uncertain , and I smiled at her .   
“
So I do n’t want you tense around me .
”
“
I ’m nervous in my own way , and I think that ’s how it shows , ” I said .   
“
It ’s not you .   
Can I give you a bit of a hug , here , emotional support ?
”
“ Please .
”
I put one arm around her shoulders and squeezed .   
Sveta moved her head in my direction , I moved mine in her direction , knocking heads with her a bit .
Off in the distance , even though she was more than a hundred feet away , I could hear Kenzie cooing and ‘ aww’ing over the hug , as she looked at us .
“
What did I miss ?
” Tristan asked .
“
I ’m anxious , ” Sveta said .
“
Me too ,
” Tristan said .   
“
Your control gets bad when you ’re nervous , right ?   
You have more reflexive movements ?
”
“
It gets so fucking shitty , ” Sveta said .   
“
I ’m sorry .   
I ’m worried I ’ll be terrible because I ’m all over the place inside here .   
I do n’t know if you can hear it , but I keep fumbling because I ’ll reflexively reach out to grab something off in the distance and hit the wall of the suit instead , and then I have to reach for the right control ring again .
”
“
Do the best you can , ” Tristan said .
“ This is n’t about grading you as an individual , ” I said .
“
It ’s about the team , ” Sveta said .   
“ I do n’t want to let the team down .   
Can we start ?   
I ’ll get more nervous if we wait .
”
“
Sure , ” I said .
The other three were n’t wrapped up in their discussion anymore .   
I called out , “ You guys want your flag ?
”
“
Here , ” Sveta said .  
She held out her hand .  
I passed her the blue flag .
She passed it to the others , hand and forearm gripping the flag , tendrils pushing the hand and forearm .   
She stopped short , relying on only the momentum so it only punched Chris lightly in the man - boob .   
He caught her hand and arm in one large hand , plucking the flag free before releasing her hand .   
He smiled as he held it up , then he reached low to hand it to Kenzie .   
The two of them went to plant it , with Chris picking up a fallen tree on the way .
It seemed Chris and Kenzie got along better like this .
Ashley did n’t join them .   
Instead , she started walking toward us , picking her way through weeds and grass .   
She still had a partial smile on her face from before .
I flew to meet her partway .
“ Ground rules ?
”
she asked , when I was closer .
“ Place your flag .  
You grab ours and bring it to yours , or vice - versa .  
Whoever has both flags at their starting point wins .   
Try to avoid hurting the trees .   
No personal injuries that are n’t going to heal in a day .   
Bruises and scrapes are inevitable , but let ’s avoid them if we can .
”
“
Understood .
”   
She turned to walk away , one hand raised to give me an over - the - shoulder salute as she did .
Tristan began altering the battlefield behind her , drawing out fifty little sparks to move along the surface of our side of the hill .
The other team was just on the other side of a trio of trees .   
The nervousness we all felt was apparent as Kenzie ’s cube lit up , making a deep beep sound .
All three faces of the cube that I could see had lit up .   
Numbers were apparent .   
’10’ …   
‘ 9’ …   
‘ 8’ … “
It ’s worth remembering that she can remotely control the cube , ” Tristan said .   
“ Hm .
”
“ Just the flashlight gun and the eyehook
, right ?
”
Sveta asked , giving Tristan a look .
Tristan moved his hand , and finalized his alteration to the slope between our fort and the halfway point of the battlefield .   
Uneven ground , raised segments and lowered ones .   
Most of it was flat , the spikes sticking out of the sides or toward the ground at an angle .   
The material was solid , white with orange - red in the crevices , running through it like ore in rock .
The timer continued .   
‘
3’ …   
‘ 2’ …   
‘ 1’ …    ‘ Go’ .
They came out of the trees .   
As Tristan had suggested , Ashley ’s plan was to go on the attack .
All three of them .   
Kenzie had changed , overalls gone , replaced with a skintight suit that mirrored her outfit in color and where it changed from black to pink to red .   
Chris had his head turned , and he was using one hand to cram the last few feet of the dead tree into his mouth .
Ashley was on foot .   
White eyes were wide open behind her mask , the pupils not visible from this distance .
“
This is fine .   
Same plan , ” Tristan said , not sounding bothered in the least .
Two versus three , while Sveta grabs their flag .
Sveta reached for a tree and found her grip , hauling herself away .
Tristan began creating barricades and obstructions , aimed at being knee - height , to slow them down .
Ashley hurdled the first two .   
Chris trampled his way through the three that had been put in his way .
Kenzie turned , aimed , and fired her flash gun in Sveta ’s direction .   
She missed , aimed again , and fired .   
The second shot caught Sveta in its area .
“
You take Chris and Kenzie , I ’ll work on Ashley , ” Tristan said .   
He sounded confident .   
“
Keep an eye on Kenzie , make sure she does n’t fall .
” I flew to intercept .   
Chris had one hand full with the tree , mouth distended with a fat tongue sticking out , apparently to keep the tree from rubbing against his lower row of teeth ; his hand served to protect the other teeth .
I was put in mind of the man I ’d seen during the broken trigger , who ’d had a tree come out the other direction .
Chris laughed , deep and booming , tree digested .   
He lowered his chin , mouth closed , hands and arms up to protect his face and guard Kenzie .
I could deal with big and strong .   
I flew closer-
saw Kenzie turn , aiming her gun at me , and changed course , covering my face and head , my forcefield up .
Even turned partially away , my arms up , the momentary flash of light blinded me .   
A full second passed , and my sight did n’t return .   
I could hear Chris’ laugh , Kenzie ’s amusement .   
My forcefield had n’t helped .
I felt the forcefield meet resistance , and I forced it to shut off before Chris’ hand could close around me .   
I pushed out with my aura to try to throw him off balance and buy myself a second , and changed course .   
I felt his fingers graze my back , dragging against cloth and not finding enough slack to get a grip .
Blindness was disorienting .   
Blindness when flying made it hard to tell which way was up and which way was down , and I knew it would get worse before it got better .
I flew away and at the ground , forcefield up , and landed hard .   
I felt Tristan ’s creation shatter under and around me as my power absorbed the hit , fragments bouncing off of me , dust collecting on me .
“
Are you okay ! ?
”
I heard Kenzie call out .
“
I ’m fine !
” I replied .
“
Do n’t give away your position if you ’ve blinded them !
”
I heard Ashley .
I heard a noise , and at first I thought it was Chris dismantling the fort .   
It sounded like someone was tearing the world ’s largest sheet of paper , nails on a blackboard ,
an alien ’s scream from a science fiction movie that echoed far more than it should , a sharp explosion , and any number of other things , all overlapping and working against one another .
I opened my eyes and tried to make out the surroundings despite the spots of light that were exploding against the backs of my eyeballs .
Chris was large enough for me to make out his general shape .   
I could make out
Ashley and Tristan ’s positions , but the only reason I could distinguish the two was because Ashley dressed in black and Tristan had more color to his costume .
Right .   
I had a few tricks up my sleeve I ’d been considering .   
This was an opportunity to try one .
I took off , and I activated my forcefield momentarily as I did it , pushing out at the cracked chunks of stonelike ground , sending pieces rolling and sliding in the wake of my takeoff .   
I needed their attention .   
I saw Chris slow momentarily , mid - stride as he walked toward the fort .
I did n’t fly straight for them , but around , circling closer to the fort .   
I paused , giving them time to see me , and then flew straight for Chris’ face , full speed .
I stopped only a few feet short , hitting him with my aura instead of my fist .   
Full - strength
, point - blank , a hit to the emotional rather than the physical .
The reaction was much the same as if I ’d punched him .   
Forward movement stopped , reversed , an off - balance stumble backward .
“ Holy fuck , ” I could hear Tristan .
I heard Damsel ’s response , but I had other focuses than making out the words .   
It might have been ‘ pay attention to your opponent’ or ‘ pay attention to who you ’re fighting’ .
I was busy flying around Chris , one hand extended so it maintained contact with him , let me gently push him , all while helping me to navigate while still partially blind .   
Before he fully had his balance , I caught him by the shoulders and pulled him back and down toward the ground .
He walked backward rather than topple , helped by the fact that his head was small , his shoulders and neck narrow relative to his lower body .   
It was part of why his center of balance was low to the ground , with his weight gathered around gut , butt , and legs .
Kenzie ’s pincer - claw grabbed for my arm , then pulled my arm away from Chris .   
I let it , grabbing the prehensile length of it between Kenzie and me .    
Not a huge factor .   
One hand still on Chris’ shoulder , I activated my forcefield , using the added strength to pull at Chris .   
He continued his backward walk until he stumbled into one of Tristan ’s sections of raised ground .
He toppled , and I shifted my position to guide his fall for the first half of the way .   
The focus on the latter half of the way was letting my forcefield down and catching Kenzie .
Chris fell flat on his back .   
Kenzie wriggled momentarily , and I deposited her on Chris’ chest , to make getting to his feet just a little bit harder .   
The claw slipped free of my arm .
My vision was clearing enough for me to see vague expressions , without precise detail .   
Chris was grinning , shaking with a laugh or chuckle .
“ Come on , get up , get up ! ”
Kenzie goaded him .
“
Get off me then !
”
Chris boomed .
Orange motes were starting to surround them .
“ Victoria !
”
Tristan called out .   
“ Switch with me !
”
The words were barely out of his mouth when Ashley used her power again .   
It was noisy to the point I worried my ears would be ringing an hour after this exercise .     
I could see it as a visible blur of shadow aimed behind her and toward the ground .   
She used the recoil to launch herself off to one side , to help her get around and past Tristan .   
More orange motes appeared in the direction she was going .
She used her power again , changing course to fly straight for Tristan .   
She planted one foot on his shoulder , stepped down so her back grazed against his , her long hair draping over his head and shoulders , aimed forward with both hands , and used her power a third time just as she touched ground , her back to his .
A power - augmented body - check .   
The recoil of her power pushed her in the opposite direction she fired , but because she was in contact with Tristan , she pushed him too .   
She stumbled , but he sprawled to the ground , his armor striking the hard platform he ’d created on the slope , metal screeching and clashing against stone .
The orange motes that had started to appear around Chris and Kenzie came to life around them , an especially spiky , irregular outcropping with a thin ridge extending out to the growth he ’d been making in front of Ashley
’s original course , which became its own vaguely pineapple - shaped formation .
He ’d wanted me to deal with Ashley .   
Okay .   
She was rolling her shoulders , rubbing at one , while she stalked toward the fort .
I could see better , so I could possibly pull this technique off better .   
I flew at her , and she barely seemed to pay me any mind .
My feet touched ground , helping to stop me as I reversed my direction of flight to cancel out my forward movement .   
I ’d wanted to avoid all physical contact , but I did bump my shoulder into hers as I went from flying at near - top speed to a full stop , my face a couple of inches from hers , well inside her personal space .
As with Chris , I used my emotion aura .
As had been the case with Chris , the effect was immediate and profound .   
She stumbled back much as if I ’d flown into her and given her a strong shove , her eyes wide .
I ’d barely found my own footing when she found hers .   
Another blast , jarring for my ears .   
My vision was already suffering , and it was made worse by the plume of dust and debris around and to one side of her .   
She used the blast and a push of her legs to throw herself at the wall .
The moment she made contact with it , she used her power again , flinging herself out into empty space , hair and dress fluttering .
My first instinct was that she was going to have a rough landing , that I might need to catch her .   
Before I ’d even figured out how I might do it , she used her power once more .   
She was aiming up at an angle , so that meant she was pushed down by the recoil .
It was n’t a mere drop - kick or a fall , but a spearing plunge .   
I did much as she ’d done , pushing out with my legs in conjunction with a use of my power , my flight , to get out of her way .
With the speed and general profile of a pickaxe head driven into the ground , she landed on hard ground , in the same spot I ’d been standing .   
There was a second where she stood there , hair draping down , hands out at her sides with fingers splayed , and then one of her legs wobbled and she dropped to one knee .
“
Are you-
”
I started .   
I thought I saw her move and paused .   
“
Are you okay ?   
That landing looks like it hurt .
”
She raised her face and looked up at me .   
White eyes behind a black mask , behind white hair .
She used her power again .   
Cords , columns , and shaped explosions of lensing , bending , and darkening within the roughly cone - shaped area , over the one or two seconds that she was creating each blast .   
She did n’t even rise from her kneeling position .   
She threw herself at me , and this time she caught me entirely off guard .   
Her knees hit my shoulders , at least one of her arms caught me around the head , the fabric of her dress pulling against my face as she tried to fold herself around my head .
Holy shit , was my first thought .   
She was not letting up .   
Every time she acted , it was with the energy of a sprinter taking off from their starting position , except her power gave her more of a push , and the jarring noises only magnified the surprise of it .
My second thought was that she had seized my head .   
She wanted to take me down to the ground , much as I ’d toppled Chris .   
There were two ways I could go .   
To roll with the movement and use it , or to fight against it .
My instinct was to fight against it .   
I used my flight , going up when she wanted to take me down .   
I used my aura , which was more effective when people were close , and she was wrapped around my head .   
I used my forcefield , only for one moment , while reaching up , putting my forearm against her ribs , and pried her off of me .
She used her power in the same instant
she was pried off-
fast enough that I was left with the feeling she had expected to use it while still holding onto me .   
Her landing looked like a rough one , sprawling , one shin , one foot , one hand bracing against the ground as she skidded .
I saw her slowly clench and unclench her hands , rolling one shoulder .   
She did n’t stand .
“ Hoo , ”
I said .   
My heart was pounding , and I fanned myself a bit with my hand .   
“
You do remember this is a training exercise , right ?
”
“ You do realize my team is going to win this ?
” she retorted .   
Her hands shifted position slightly .
Her face gave away nothing , I realized .   
It did n’t help that with the dust , her hair across her face , and the last remaining spots of light in my vision , I could n’t make out her pupils .   
Her hands and where they were pointing were one of her tells .   
Her shoulders another .   
She was thin , but especially as she crouched there , hands slightly behind her and at her sides , shoulders pointing forward , I could see the muscles underneath the skin around her shoulder and shoulder blade .
Was there power or Manton protection there , keeping her from dislocating her shoulders when she used the recoil to move around like that ?   
Was it just strength and practice ?
I ’d relied on instinct to respond to her , and I did n’t love that I ’d relied on that instinct .   
I wanted to be careful and thoughtful about the moves I made and
Ashley ’s approach allowed absolutely none of that .   
I was left to digest that I ’d reacted to her by fighting , going the opposite direction instead of the Judo - like approach of using the enemy ’s strength against them .
Was I okay with that ?   
If I had to rationalize my choice , I ’d fought her because I could only use the enemy
’s momentum against them if I knew which way they were going , and Ashley was hard to predict .
Well , just a bit less difficult now , as I stopped looking for more obvious tells .   
She had stopped rolling her shoulder .   
I saw the muscles tense .
“ Victoria !
”
The shout interrupted both of us , as she planned her next move
and I readied my response .   
It was Tristan calling .   
Ashley and I both looked .
“
Come and help !
”
he called out .
I flew back and away , out of Ashley ’s reach , looking .
Chris , legs embedded in spiky rock , was using both hands to haul what looked like a long , thin rod out of his throat .   
He ’d swallowed the length of the dead tree like a sword - swallower swallowed a blade , and now he was drawing it back out , changed .
Narrower , thinner , smoother , and slick with fluids .
Chris , it seemed , was n’t just the kind of changer who could adapt his form .   
He was the kind of changer who gained new sorts of powers while in an alternate form .
He hauled the last of the tree free of his mouth .   
Fifteen feet long , thicker at the end he had just removed than at the end he held , now that he was turning it around to get it in a position he could wield it .   
Too long to be a proper club , not quite a rod either .
Kenzie had her flash gun out .   
Tristan had thrown up a short wall , just tall and wide enough that he could hide behind it .   
Kenzie ’s eyehook extended from her belt , through one of her hands , and out to Tristan , with a grip on his leg .   
She was simultaneously trying to circle around to get at an angle where she could shoot and blind Tristan and she was using the claw at the end of the prehensile arm to try and drag him out of the cover , helped by tugs with her hand .
Kenzie ’s efforts left Chris entirely unmolested as he brought his weapon down , shattering Tristan ’s created ground , freeing his legs .
“
Leave her !
”
Tristan ordered .   
“
We ’ll let her get the flag , deal with these two , and catch her on her return trip !
”
I flew a little further away .
Sveta-
I looked off in the direction of the enemy
’s camp .
Little blue flags decorated the landscape on their side of the playing field .   
They were situated on every rock , in every crevice , on every flat expanse of ground , on every tree branch .   
Sveta was perched on a rock in the midst of it all .
I looked at Kenzie ’s cube .   
One face of it was glowing .   
The projector .
That would be why they had been smiling , then .
I started my flight toward toward Tristan .
“ You ’ll regret ignoring me , ” Ashley said , behind me .
Pride , respect , they were key factors here .   
I could remember the meeting , the narrowing of the eyes .   
I knew Tristan was in a tough spot , but I paused , turning around in the air .   
I had to raise my voice to be heard with the distance between Ashley and me , as I said , “
We ’re not ignoring you .   
We ’re dealing with you two against one .
”
I left her to limp toward the wall while I flew to Tristan ’s side .   
I landed beside Kenzie , hard , pushing out with my aura .
She twisted around , gun in hand , and I caught the gun , snatching it out of her hand .
“
Hey , ” she said .   
She reached out with her hand , and I pulled the gun away .   
She let go of Tristan and reached out for the gun with the eye - hook .   
I grabbed the eye - hook , and then wrapped the length of the prehensile arm around her upper body , tying her up with it .
“
Hey !
”
she said , again .   
She laughed .   
“ Chris help !
”
I did n’t need to ask , and I liked that I did n’t need to ask .   
Orange motes began to surround Kenzie .
“
No , no , no , no ! ”
Kenzie said .   
“ Chris , Chris , Chris , Chris !
”
The head of the long club was poked out between Kenzie and me , separating us .   
Kenzie started to back away , and the orange motes became solid rock , encapsulating her legs .   
Tristan lunged forward to catch her before her upper body came down and her head cracked down against his rocky terrain .
I flew up a little ways , putting myself between them and Chris .   
Chris drew the fat end of the club back , and then smacked it against his palm .   
He laughed , deep and low , and pointed at Kenzie .
“
Stop laughing at me and help ,
you doofus !
”
I had Kenzie ’s gun in hand , I could have shot Chris , but I had my deep reservations about using a tinker
’s stuff , even a nonlethal gun that temporarily blinded .
Ashley used her power .   
I could hear the sound of it , and I saw the wall break .
“ By the way , ” Tristan said , looking in that direction .   
“
We ’re not catching her on the return trip .
”
He blurred , and with that blurring , the rock blurred too .   
White with orange - red veins became clear water , reflecting the blue of the sky and the green of the trees above and grass below .   
The front wall of the fort that Ashley had just penetrated and the platform that Kenzie and Chris were standing on became frothing water .
With the slope , that water flowed downhill , carrying Ashley and Kenzie down to the base of the hill , amid branches , mud , and sticks .   
Ashley used her power at the start and toward the end , to little effect .
Chris brought his rod down , stabbing it deep into the ground , and held onto it for leverage .   
It had to be sturdier than the dead tree had been , because it did n’t bend and it did n’t break .   
Condensed down , maybe , shaped to be hard .
He reared back , and he blew .   
He ’d broken down and processed more of the dead tree than what he ’d used to condense it into a giant club - staff .   
He exhaled a cloud of wet sawdust .
I did n’t want to put up my forcefield if it would catch the sawdust , so I endured it , flew closer , and used my forcefield for only as long as it took to kick the stick he was holding onto with all of my strength .
It broke , and with it breaking , Chris fell down the hill , rolling over wet grass and weeds , until he came to a stop against a cluster of two trees that had grown next to one another .
He began to pick himself up , working his way up the hill , stabbing down to pierce the ground with his half - stick and plant it there like an ice - climber might use a piton .   
The slope was just a little steeper at the base of the hill , and the water had become rock again , smooth and with the spikes all pointed downward , not good grips .
He swallowed hard , giving me a suspicion about what he was about to do .   
He spat out a ball of wood pulp and phlegm , and I flew to one side , letting it sail past me .
I was put in mind of Crawler – the changer power , the spitting , the joyful monster .   
Crawler had laughed too .
Crawler had critically injured me with his acid spit , and that had let Amy get her hands on me the second time .
It was a dark , unpleasant thought .
Tristan was focused on a point off to the side .   
I turned to look , and I saw that he was creating orange motes around the projector box .
The motes solidified , and the box was encased in a thorny encasement of rock .
I turned to look , keeping one eye on Chris , and I saw the flags were still there .
“
Nope !   
That ’s not going to work !   
Good luck finding our flag !
” Kenzie called out .   
She loosed an over the top , mocking laugh .
Tristan turned the encasement to water .
“
I said it was waterproofed before !   
That ’s not going to do anything !
”
Kenzie called out , before doing her level best to laugh harder , even though she had already been laughing at her limit .
“
It does n’t matter , ” Tristan said , loud enough for them to hear .
Sveta made her way back in three moves , from the other team ’s camp to a rock , rock to tree , tree to our camp .
She hauled herself up to the top of one of Tristan ’s walls and she held up the two flags .
Ashley and Chris , who were making their way up the hill , stopped climbing .
“
Yes !   
Yes !   
That was so great , that was fun
, we have to do this again !
”
From what Kenzie was saying , she did n’t seem to mind losing much .   
She practically bounced with excitement .
Tristan created stairs on the slope .
Sveta joined Tristan and me as the others climbed the stairs .   
Tristan put out one gauntlet , and she tapped her prosthetic hand against it .   
I offered my own fist to her , and she tapped her fist against it , before wrapping her arms around me in a brief hug .
A stoic Ashley had Kenzie clinging to her as she reached the top .
“ -were
so cool
, it was like how you were in the videos- ” “
Ease up , Kenzie , ” Tristan said .
Kenzie let go of Ashley , bouncing on the spot before reaching up to her lens - mask and pulling it off .   
With the mask ’s removal , her costume flickered in places , like an image that had been badly compressed , with heavy artifacting .
“
This was everything I wanted it to be and more , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I ca n’t believe you found the flag .
”
“ I- ” Sveta started .
“
Waitwaitwaitwait , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Wait .   
Um .   
Okay .   
I have this covered .
”
“ Okay , ” Sveta said .
Kenzie pulled out her smartphone .
The projector made a sound , and then images streaked the hill , before correcting .   
Ghostly images of all of us , life - size .   
The images included the constructions Tristan had made .
It looked like where we had all been standing earlier in the match , when I had been facing down Ashley .
The images zipped around as Kenzie changed the time , blurring and streaking before correcting into their proper shapes .
“
I saved everything , so we can look back and watch how things played out or compare notes , ” Kenzie said .   
“
So we can do stuff like this …
”
The images blurred and moved , then shifted , so the scenes that were projected no longer lined up on the battlefield .
It was Sveta , perched on a branch , flag in hand .   
Another blur , moving the clock back .
Sveta removed one of her prosthetic hands .   
Fifty or more tendrils snapped out .
“
You grabbed every flag , ” Tristan said .
“ I grabbed at every flag , ” Sveta said .   
“ I had to reposition a few times , so I probably grabbed at some fake ones several times .   
It did n’t help that I could n’t see that well after being shot .
” Kenzie cackled .   
Chris smothered her cackling with a large hand .   
Kenzie fought back , trying to get out from under Chris’ hand , and she did a pretty poor job of it .
It was weird and good to see her finally acting like an actual kid .   
Too much excitement in her system , but that was n’t a bad thing .
Once Kenzie had settled down more , we walked through the entire fight , focusing on each person .   
Sveta was first , easy enough .
Tristan was next , and he made mention of the platform , and how he ’d wanted to make sure nobody had footing when the rock turned to water , so he ’d raised the ground some .   
He had obviously plotted the trap from early on .
“
Kenzie ?   
Do you want to report what you were doing ?
”
Tristan asked , once he was done explaining what he ’d done to Sveta .
“
Wait , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Rain ’s here .   
I ’ll point the way .
”
It took a couple of minutes before Rain and Kenzie ’s camera - drone arrived at the base of the hill .
Chris was half the size he had been , and his proportions were returning to normal .   
As he shrank , he rearranged the voluminous shorts he ’d been wearing , ensuring his modesty was protected .   
His old outfit was contained within a pocket on the inside of the shorts , and he gathered it together , folded up , the clothes piled on his lap , along with what looked like a pencil case .
Even though he was returning to the person he ’d been , physically , his smile lingered .
“ Rainnn ! ”
Kenzie called out , while Rain was still making his way to us .   
“
Did you bring tinker stuff ! ?
”
“
Yeah !
”
Rain responded .
“ Yusss , ” Kenzie said .   
“
This is the best day .
”
“ You could have waited twenty seconds for Rain to show up and asked him in a normal volume , ” Chris said .
“ I wanted to know now .
”
Chris groaned at her , putting his face closer to hers .
Kenzie groaned louder , exaggerated , putting her face closer to his .
Chris groaned even louder , guttural , using some of the residual transformation to play up the sound .   
His forehead pressed against hers , hard enough she had to push back to avoid being pushed over .
Rather than try to top it , Kenzie sat back down .   
“
I like you when you ’re like this .
”
“ Naked ?
” Chris asked .
“
No ! ” Kenzie said .   
“ Geez
. ” “
Why does it feel like every time I enter a conversation , it ’s a weird topic ?
”
Rain asked , joining us where we sat on Tristan - created seats and benches .
“
I like you when you ’re happy , ” Kenzie said .   
She fussed with her hair , looking down .   
“
I like you a lot like this .
”
I was put in mind of her comments about Chris before she ’d gotten in Erin ’s car , after leaving the group meeting .   
Like she did n’t have the worldly experience to know people
did n’t say stuff like that in such an unguarded , dead obvious way .
“ I still think you ’re annoying as shit , ” Chris said .
Sveta kicked him .
Kenzie snorted , smiling as she looked up at him .   
“ I know .
”
“ Nah .   
I ’m
joking .   
You ’re fine .   
I think we did pretty good .
”
“ I think we did too .   
It would have worked except Tristan and Byron are strong and Victoria is oof and Sveta was the best counter to what we were doing .   
We should fill Rain in .
”
“ That would be nice , ” Rain said .   
“
It was you two and …
”
He turned to look around the group , saw Ashley , and did n’t finish the sentence .
“
And me , ” Ashley said .
“
Here , I can show you the replay , ” Kenzie said .   
“
But I want to see your tinker arms too , before we run out of time .
”
“
There ’s plenty of time , ” Tristan said .
“
Wait , here , you take the remote , and Rain , you can hand me the arm , I wo n’t break anything , I promise .
”
Rain rummaged in his backpack , “ I would n’t blame you
if you did , it ’s fragile and shitty .   
You think it would help your eyehook ?
”
“ It might !   
But I ’m really interested in the interface .   
You like to have multiple arms , you said ?
”
“
Yeah .   
For what little it ’s worth .
”
“
And you control it with your brain , once it ’s plugged in ?
”
Kenzie asked .   
When Rain nodded , she asked , “ How does the brain know how to control it ?
”
“ I map the brain patterns for input and output and the panel here , between the attachment and the actual arm , it acts like an extension of the brain .
”
“ That does n’t make any sense , ” Sveta said .
Tristan was fiddling with the remote , and seemed to be having trouble with the progression of time , with images jumping all over the place .   
Sveta , Kenzie , and Rain were all focused on the arm , with Ashley periodically joining in when prodded .
Chris was sitting on the bench , cloth around him as he shrunk down to a more ordinary size .   
He was smiling more than before as he rummaged for his headphones and a chocolate bar .
“
Your mood seems better , ” I said to him .
The smile dropped away .   
He looked at me and shrugged .   
“
It ’s different .   
I feel more human , mentally and emotionally .
”
The change had n’t seemed to make any difference in how he looked , either .   
Were the changes subtle ?
“
I ’m not
sure
I grasped it all , ”
I told him .   
“
Once you change , it ’s … ?
” I trailed off .
“
It ’s like a hit of a drug , ” he said .   
“
Focus , surprise , sadness , appreciation , disgust , fear , anger , and then this one .
”
“
Joy ?
”
“ I call this particular flavor of it
Wan Indulgence , ” he said .   
He bit down on the chocolate bar , then closed his eyes , clearly enjoying it .   
He talked with his mouth full , “ Can be enjoyment .   
I ’ll feel it more normally for a few days now that I ’ve changed .
”
“
Oh my god , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Tristan , give that back , you suck at it .
”
Tristan was still fiddling with Kenzie ’s remote for the projector box .
“
It does n’t make any sense .   
Why is n’t it easier to move forward and back in time ?
”
“ Because the box does n’t perceive time , you dummy .   
It perceives images .
”
“ Why not have it perceive things like time , so you can go backward and forward in time without doing
… whatever arcane thing you ’re doing right now ?
”
“
Because if it perceived time , ” Kenzie said , patiently , her focus on the smartphone remote ,
“
Then it would n’t perceive images .   
And that would be a dumb thing for a projector box that works with images .   
Dummy .
”
“ You can stop calling me a dummy now .
”
“ I will if you stop being dumb .   
This stuff is obvious .
”
“
It ’s really not , ” Chris said .
Kenzie sighed , very dramatically .   
“
Who are we following next ?
”
“
It ’d be nice to show Rain the entire thing , ” Tristan said .
“ It works best with a point of view , ” Kenzie said .   
She looked at Tristan and rolled her eyes a little .
“
If you keep that up , you ’re going to see orange lights swirling over your head .   
Then a rock is going to fall on you or , more likely , I ’ll swap out and you ’ll get a spray of cold water .
”
Kenzie stuck out her tongue at Tristan .
I was aware that Ashley had n’t participated enthusiastically in the conversation .   
I suspected why .   
I hesitated , then ventured , “ I ’d really like to see how Ashley approached things .
”
“
Why ? ”
Ashley asked .
My suspicions were stronger .   
I went on , “
Frankly , I hope this is n’t taken the wrong way , but you ’re really intimidating to go up against .
”
“
It ’s fine , ” she said .   
“
It ’s the intention .
”
“
A big part of the reason I swapped out with Victoria is that I had no idea what to do , ” Tristan said .   
“ I could n’t catch you with my power , and you ’re faster than me on foot .
”
Kenzie was changing the perspective .   
She created a projection of the hillside and shrank things down , then created more projections , showing an image off to one side of our gathering , showing a zoomed in portion of what the little diorama - sized projection was showing as a whole .   
The focus started with the three emerging from the trees , trampling through and hurdling the barriers Tristan created .
She jumped to Tristan trying to deal with Ashley .
“ Those blasts are as scary as shit , ” Tristan said .   
“ Every time you used one , even if you were five feet away and you were n’t aiming at me , I was flinching .   
I saw what it was doing to my powerstuff , and I did not want that to happen to my bodystuff .
”
He ’d realized what I was doing , and why , I realized .   
Ashley was dejected at losing and we could give her a bit of a morale boost .   
She seemed to like being scary .
I was n’t wholly sure it was good to feed her ego on that front , but I was n’t sure I liked the alternative , either .
“ I have better control than that .   
I ’m not an idiot , ” Ashley said .
“
I ’m not saying you are , ” Tristan said .
“
It ’s obvious
you have control , ” I said .   
“ Kenzie , can you show the walljump ?
”
“
There are two .
”
“ The one with me , ” I said .
Kenzie jumped to the scene .   
Ashley leaping off of the wall with one foot , her power just starting to explode out from her hands .   
The power looked more solid in projection than it did in reality .
“ For the record , ” Kenzie said .   
“ If I was moving through this recording in time and not space , then I ’d have to fast forward and rewind and skip around to find this , but I do n’t ,
so I hope people are realizing why this is better .
”
“
I ’m fully in support of dumping water on Kenzie ’s head , ” Chris said .
“
The walljump , ” I said .   
“
The sequences of blasts to maneuver and the whole - body coordination it must take .   
That , to me , says control .
”
“
All for nothing , ” she said .
“
It was not for nothing , ” I said .   
“
I got to see and experience what you do
, I respect the spatial awareness .   
The instinct-
”
“ I fell for a trap , ” she said .   
“
I knew there would be water
and I thought I could avoid it if I used my power in time , I did n’t expect there to be so much .
”
“ We ’ve never seen each other ’s powers in action , ” Tristan said .   
“ Surprises are inevitable .   
You surprised the shit out of me , many times , and I got one good surprise off .   
When we do it again , we ’ll know each other ’s powers better .   
It ’s part of why we ’re doing the exercises in the first place .
”
“ I failed , ” Ashley said .   
She stood up , and she rubbed one shoulder .   
“
I was tested and I failed .
”
“
Right from the start , ” Sveta said , jumping into the conversation   
“ When we were standing around figuring out what we ’d do , Victoria told me that this was n’t a test of us as individuals .   
It ’s a test of our coordination as a team .
”
“ I can find that on the recording , ” Kenzie said .   
“
It ’ll be hard to find , though .
”
“ Hah , ” Chris said .   
Kenzie pushed his shoulder .
“
My team failed , ” Ashley said , oblivious to the pair .   
“
No .   
My team was set up to fail .
”
“
Wait , woah , ” Tristan said .
Ashley clenched one hand into a fist .   
“
You realize if I had n’t been holding back , I could have annihilated each and every one of you ?
”
“ Woah , ” Tristan said , with emphasis .   
“
Ashley-
”
She whirled on him , pointing , and he flinched , going silent .   
I stood from my seat .
“ Ashley , ” I said , because I wanted her attention off of Tristan .
“
I ’m not Ashley ,
” she said , her voice hard .   
“
Nobody has called me that in a long , long time .   
I ’m
only Ashley because the therapists insisted and the others needed an actual name to put on the paperwork .   
I ’m
Damsel of Distress !
”
“
Okay , ” I said .   
“
Can we-
”
I was spoken over .   
“
I was a member of the Slaughterhouse Nine .   
They selected me .   
They had me kill and maim people .   
I did n’t mind doing it then , and I could do it here without blinking .
”
“
I do n’t believe you , ” Sveta said .
“ I ’ve died and I came back with only the vicious parts of me intact !   
All of the warmth , the good memories , the family , they ’re just a fuzzy , indistinct dream .   
Those memories have no hold on me .   
The killing ?   
Taking
people ’s arms and legs and watching them bleed out ?   
That ’s clear as anything .   
I could do the same to any of you .
”
I wanted the younger and more vulnerable members of the team to back away , to get clear of trouble , but I worried that if I tried to indicate that , it might provoke her .   
Everyone was still , and nobody , myself included , was really breathing .
“
This was an idiotic game , and I.    Do n’t .   
Play .   
Games .
”
“ Count down from ten , ” Rain said .
Ashley whirled on him .   
I left the ground , flying closer , stopping when things did n’t escalate further .
“ Count down from ten , ” Rain said .   
“
That ’s what Mrs. Yamada says , is n’t it ?   
When you ’re wound up .
”
“
It ’s fine when she says it .
”
“
It should be fine when any of us say it , ” Rain said .   
“ Count .
” Ashley tensed .   
I could see it in her shoulders and the way the tendons stood out in her hands .
Everyone was silent .
I waited .   
Ten seconds passed .   
Then the fifteenth , then the twentieth .
“ Feel better ?
” Sveta ventured .
Ashley turned , staring Sveta down .   
“
No . ”
“ Count down from a hundred , ” Rain said .
“
I ’m not going
to-
”
“ Count , ” Rain said , his voice soft .   
“ Please .   
You ’ve said before , when you get like this , there ’s a part of you that ’s saying you do n’t want to act this way , and you ca n’t listen to it .   
So listen to the numbers first , then listen to that part of you .
”
“
It ’s not that easy .
”
“
It’s- ”
“
It ’s not that easy , ” she said .   
“
And I ’m going to walk away .   
You do your thing .   
Let me do mine .
”
“ Okay , ” Rain said .
She limped away , hands in fists at her side .   
We were silent as we watched her go .
She walked up the hill , found a rock , and leaned against it , her back to us , and I let my feet touch ground .
“ We knew it was coming sooner or later , ” Chris said .
“ Spooky , ”
Sveta said.”I expected a small outburst to start with .   
That was-
”
“ Medium - small , ” Tristan said .
Kenzie stood up , gathering her things .
“
Stay , Kenzie , ” Sveta said .
“
It ’s fine .
”
“ She wants to be left alone .
”
“
This thing ?
”
Kenzie asked .   
“
It ’s not
you guys being the adults and me as the kid , listening to what adults say .   
We ’re all equal members of this team .   
And this is what I ’m going to do , and if I get hurt that ’s fine , but this is right for me .   
You can tell me what to do with some other stuff
but not this stuff .
”
“
It ’s dangerous ,
” I said .   
“
Leave her be .
”
“
No , ” Kenzie said , voice firm .   
She put her hand on her flash gun .   
She looked at all of us , then said , softer , “ No .
”
“
Okay , Kenzie , ” Sveta said .   
“
Go .   
Be careful .
”
“
You ’re sure ?
”
Tristan asked Sveta .
But Kenzie was already jogging off in Ashley ’s direction .
When Kenzie was out of earshot , but before she had reached Ashley , Sveta raised one hand and said , voice quiet , “ If there ’s a problem , I ’ll haul her back .
”
“ That takes a second or two , ” I said .   
“ Sparring with Ashley , I got ta say she moves faster than that .
”
“
And your grip is n’t a hundred percent , ” Tristan said .
Sveta set her jaw , hand pointed at Kenzie .
Kenzie reached Ashley , and with Ashley ’s movement , we all tensed , preparing to act .
Ashley turned back to look out at the distance , and Kenzie climbed up on the rock Ashley was leaning against .
A moment later , Kenzie had her headphones out of a pocket .   
She plugged it into her phone , reached down , and put an earbud in Ashley ’s ear , then put another in her ear , before lying down on the rock .
Slowly , Sveta lowered her hand .
“
Why ?
” I asked .
“ I gave my reasons before , so did Rain , so did Kenzie , ” Sveta said .   
“
We ’ve had this discussion .   
This is n’t news .
”
“
It ’s one thing to know it and see it in therapy
, it ’s another to experience it in the wild , ” Rain said .
“
Why ?
”
I asked , again .   
“
You can’t- I understand reaching out to people , but can you really reach out to people who are n’t reaching back ?   
Can you give forgiveness and understanding to someone who is n’t looking for it ?
”
“ I think she is , ” Sveta said .
Tristan said , “ I do n’t know what you guys talked about , but I discussed this with the others , and I have an idea what they probably said .   
Do you know how many appointments and meetings she goes to ?
”
“
It came up , ” Rain said .
“
Okay , good .   
But did you talk about why ?
”
“
Because she needs careful handling ?
”
I asked .
“
Because , ” Tristan said , “ She ’s a special case .   
She ’s not the original Ashley
, I ’m not sure if you picked up on that .
”
“ I got the gist of it .
”
“
Like she said , her memories are n’t hers .   
She was cloned , they took her and they made up composite memories , but they had no reason to give her those fuzzy memories of other , nonconfrontational stuff .   
That was n’t Bonesaw ’s work .   
It ’s the agent .
”
I drew in a breath
and I sighed .
“ The world ended , and it ended because of them .   
We ca n’t have a sit - down talk with Scion because we killed him .   
We have a shitton of questions and the only kinds of people who can answer them
are the people who got really close to the agents , like Bonesaw , who made Ashley-
”
I felt a chill .
“ -and
the people like this .   
Who are very little of the human , shadows of the human , and a lot of the agent .   
All of us have problems , and a big part of those problems are the agents , handling their side of things .   
I know
I ’ve talked to Rain about this
, I do n’t know about the rest of you guys , but
when I ’m talking to her
I ’m also talking to the agent that ’s very close to the surface .   
I feel like if I can get along with that agent , I can get along with mine .
”
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .
“ I want to get along with the human , ” Sveta said .   
“ I do n’t want to define her as the monstrous half .
”
“
That ’s fair too ,
” Tristan said .
I folded my arms .   
I looked down at Chris , and I saw that he was half - asleep .
He saw me looking , and he said , “ The world was invaded by aliens .   
People do n’t know it , we do n’t like to think about it , but they ’re here
, they ’re a part of things .   
Getting along with the most accessible of them makes sense .
”
I did n’t like it , but I was n’t sure how to articulate it .   
My own agent had a hand in my life .   
It was the wretch , the sapience behind the forcefield .   
I had seen what Amy ’s had done to her .
Thinking too hard about it stirred up countless ugly feelings , and those feelings choked out and clouded the words I wanted to articulate .
“
Let ’s leave them be , ” Rain said .   
“
Let ’s assume we ’re not going to have our second exercise , and walk me through how things went .
”
“
Alright , ” Tristan said .








Kenzie sprinted toward the wall , and took a flying kick at it .  
The wall broke , split at a diagonal , the upper half sliding down the split until the corner stabbed the ground .  
Kenzie backed up swiftly before the section of wall toppled and fell to the ground .
“
I ’m clearly the strongest member of the team , ” she said .
“
You ’re the lamest , ” Chris said .
“
Can I try it again ?
”
Kenzie asked , ignoring Chris .  
“ Rain ?
”
“ Be careful , ” Sveta said .
“ I will .  
I want to test stuff .  
Can I try it again ?
”
Rain stood from the rock he was sitting on , and held one hand out to the side .  
The silver - white blade he created had a slight crescent shape to it .  
He swung his arm and threw it , for lack of a better word .  
It traced an arc , more a boomerang in flight than an arrow or thrown weapon , and cut deep into the wall that Tristan had left as a permanent fixture .  
A silver - white line was left along the length of the wall .
Kenzie raised her flash gun , and she shot the wall .  
Nothing happened .
She approached the wall , and she had her eyehook snake out from where it was attached to her belt , pincers open , slapping against the wall .  
She pushed with the eyehook .
“
Hurry , ” Rain said .
Kenzie continued using the eyehook to push , to no avail .  
She moved the hook around to the wall
’s edge , grabbed the length of the eyehook , and pulled , adding her strength to the mechanical arm ’s .
Stone slid easily against stone , and the wall was pulled down , cleanly cut where the silver line had been drawn .
“
I could do this all day , ” Kenzie said .
“
It ’s not a bad power , ” I said .
“
I never said it was bad , ” Rain said .  
He sat back down .  
“
It ’s mediocre .  
On certain days , it ’s a little better .
”
“
Better how ?  
Size , speed , effectiveness , number you can throw ?
”
“
All of the above , except maybe effectiveness .  
And duration , I ’d say .  
Ten , twenty percent increase , if I had to guess .
”
“ Duration ?
”
“ How long after I shoot stuff the line lasts .
”
I turned to my laptop
and I started typing that up .
“
Not effectiveness ?
”
Kenzie asked , as she rejoined us .  
She had her phone out and walked without looking where she was going .
Sveta and Tristan were having a conversation off to one side
, Ashley had gone back to the library to use the washroom , which had freed Kenzie to rejoin us , and Chris was getting dressed again while under the cover of the giant - size shorts .
“
It ’s kind of one thing or the other , ” Rain said .  
“
Either it breaks or it does n’t .
”
“
I ’m looking at the data from my eyehook , ” Kenzie said .  
“ It did n’t work with your power until after I started helping it .  
Twenty point two pounds of force total , that ’s nine point one six kilograms , and then the break happened .  
What if it ’s easier to break things when your power is better ?
”
“ It could be , ” Rain said .
“
It ’s good thinking , ” I said .
Kenzie nodded , eyes still on her phone , and said , “ Can you throw another ?
”
“ More tests ?
”
Rain asked .
“
No .   
Breaking stuff like this is a ton of fun , ” Kenzie said .
Rain stood , looked around , and then created another blade of silver - white light .  
He threw it at the half - stick Chris had left impaled in the hillside .  
The blade passed through the dead - tree stick , leaving a white line in it a good few feet above the ground , and continued forward as two separate segments flying in parallel , with a narrow gap in the middle .  
One hit a tree , and the other hit the ground .
Kenzie ran off , handing her phone to her eyehook .
“
What happens if you hit a person ?
” I asked .
“
I tried on livestock , a goat .   
Silver line .
”
“
And ?
”
“ The goat ran off , jumped up onto a tractor tire , then jumped down .  
The impact as she jumped down was what did it .  
Clean cut .
”
“ Possibly over twenty pounds of force in that impact ?
”
“ I guess , ” Rain said .
Kenzie had reached the rod and found the silver line was higher than she could reach .  
She began rolling a nearby rock closer , to give herself a leg up .
Chris , barefoot , wearing his t - shirt and shorts , broke into a sprint .  
As Kenzie climbed up onto the rock , Chris threw himself at the rod , hard , body - checking it .  
It broke in two at the silver line , the top half toppling .
Kenzie made the kind of high - pitched noise only a prepubescent girl could , and drew her flash gun .  
She began shooting Chris repeatedly , while he rolled in the grass , laughing , arms around his face .
“
What happens when you hit the ground ?
” I asked .
“
Not much , most of the time .  
I guess you get a fissure , but it does n’t really do much , because the line is so clean .
”
“ Kenzie !
”
I called out .
She stopped shooting Chris and turned to look .
“ Stomp on the line on the ground ?  
I ’m curious !
”
She ran off , leaving Chris where he was .
“
Can you explain the schedule , then ?  
The powers wax and wane ?
”
Rain sighed .
“
Sorry , if I ’m grilling you a little too much .  
I ’m trying to get my head around this .
”
“ I see them in my dreams .   
I never get a good night ’s sleep , never dream normally .   
Just … them .  
And they see me .  
We take turns , and when my turn comes up , I get a bit of a power up .
”
“
That ’s how you knew Snag ’s description , before you knew his name .
” Rain nodded .
Off in the distance , Kenzie stomped on the silver line in the grass .  
There was a bit of dust , and some grass stalks fell , but I did n’t see anything else .  
She looked at us and shrugged .
“
Every five days , I get my turn , and I ’m a little bit stronger .  
There are other times
I ’m stronger , but it ’s complicated .
”
“
Every five ?  
There ’s four others ?
”
“
Three others , ” Rain said .
“
What ’s … ?
”
“
The day in the rotation after me , it ’s a blank space .  
My running theory is that there was a fifth member of the cluster , but they died before the powers set in .  
Free power - up , goes to someone random .  
Does n’t always line up with our power , so on those days , I can sometimes have more tinker power , or more mover power , more emotion power .  
A taste of what I could be .
”
“
Once every twenty days , on average .
”
“ Never lining up with my days , ” he said .  
He sighed .  
“ Through the dreams I ’ve seen them unmasked and they ’ve seen me .  
They hate me
and I ’m not overly fond of them .  
They ’re always there , every night , and it ’s pretty obvious how much they despise me .  
It ’s where Tristan and I have that shared experience , kind of .
”
“ People you ca n’t get away from , ” I said .
“ You ’re talking about your cluster ?
”
Tristan asked , joining the conversation .  
Sveta was behind him .
“
Yeah .
”
Tristan sat down on the rock beside Rain .  
I scooted over so Sveta could sit beside me .
“ These people want you dead ?   
How likely is it they go forward with this hit ?
”
“ Ninety - nine point eight percent likely , ” Rain said .
“
What ’s the point two ?
” Sveta asked .
“ They all die or get arrested before they get around to it , ” Rain said .
“ You seem pretty cavalier about traveling into the city , ” I said .   
“
You caught a train today ?
”
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .   
“
Again , it ’s the dreams , I can pick up a little , and I can throw them off a little .   
The thing about being outnumbered in this situation is that I have a lot of opportunities to pick up details .   
One clue from any of them can help a lot .
”
“ Details like ?
”
“ The woman is injured , and Snag wants to repair the arm you trashed .   
That buys me a few days .   
So , uh , thank you .
”
“ The third one wo n’t come after you alone ?
”
“
He ’s a guy , a little older than me .   
Glasses .   
He ’s the person with the tinker power .   
I have n’t picked up much about him , but he does n’t interact with people much .   
Less than Snag or the woman , and Snag is an asshole and the woman is mute , so that should tell you something .
”
“
There ’s an advantage in that , ” Tristan said .   
“ If they are n’t socially adroit and you are-
”
“
I ’m not ,
” Rain said .
“
You ’re better off than they are and that counts for something , ” Tristan said .
“ They have money and resources , and that more than makes up for it , ” Rain said .   
He looked at me .   
“
We ’re suspicious
they hired Tattletale to track me down .
”
“
Ah , ” I said .   
I thought about that .   
“
I honestly ca n’t think of someone worse to have on your trail .
”
“
She ’s good enough to take over a city and get away with it , ” Rain said .
“
That ’s not even it , ” I said .   
“
She destroys people .
”
“
Are we talking about group members behind their backs ?
”
Kenzie asked , as she joined us .
“
No , ” Tristan said .   
“ We ’re talking Tattletale .
”
Over near the staff that had been made with the dead tree , Chris was lying in the grass , arms and legs spread , staring up at the sky .
“
He ’s okay ?
” I asked .
“
He ’s fine , ” Kenzie said .
As if responding , Chris chuckled to himself , lying in the grass near the base of the hill .
“ The Undersiders took over Brockton Bay , and they did it with Tattletale on point for most of it .   
I ’m not a hundred percent sure on any of this , but you can look at the events in the city starting with her taking power .   
Bank robbery , Undersiders succeed , they run into the Wards , me , and my sister .   
Tattletale insinuates knowledge of my sister ’s deepest secrets , and mine .   
My sister goes off the deep end .   
ABB are provoked following an arrest of their leader and an interaction with the Undersiders , with Tattletale .   
They ’re toppled with a concerted effort on the part of the villains , with intel passed to the heroes by the villains .
”
“ By Tattletale , ” Tristan said .
“
In large part .   
Empire Eighty - Eight get outed , secret identities revealed .   
Undersiders are the focus of the blame , and a number of people die in the ensuing rampage .   
Weeks and months of violence and chaos in Brockton Bay feed into the Endbringer attack on the city .   
Half of my family died because of that .
”
“
I ’m
so sorry , ” Sveta said .
I reached out for her hand and gave it a waggle .   
“
It should be noted that in the hospital after the attack , Tattletale talked to the leaders of various hero teams about Leviathan ’s strengths and weaknesses .   
Info that was then used to beat down Behemoth enough to let Scion finish him off .
”
“
That could be a coincidence , ” Rain said .
He did n’t say it in a dismissive way .   
He said it like he was a little scared , and he wanted something to cling to .
I wanted to drive reality home , though .   
Better to scare him and have him alive than the alternative .
“
Possibly .   
But I ’m more inclined to see her as a force multiplier or a kind of thinker version of what you do with your power , creating weak points for others to capitalize on .   
We see a lot of these coincidences .   
After the Endbringer , the Slaughterhouse Nine visit and do a hell of a lot of damage , but they also lose several key members .   
The weaknesses of several key members are revealed and the members are removed .
”
“ You might want to go easy on talking about those guys when Ashley gets back , ” Kenzie said .
“
Okay , ” I said .   
“
It ’s just one data point in a series .   
The last remaining mastermind of the city falls , Coil .   
The PRT directors die .   
Twice , in quick succession .   
Weaknesses are targeted and capitalized on .   
Alexandria dies in Brockton Bay , at the hands of a girl who had apparently wanted to be a hero , but who was converted to the villains’ side .   
Flechette , a hero , a minor friend of mine ?   
Apparently converted .   
Accord edges into the Undersiders’ turf .   
He dies when the Behemoth fight happens .   
What do you think happens with his resources and power ?   
Because I ’m betting it ’s the same as what happened with Coil
’s .
”
“
And now she runs one of the major settlement points , ” Rain said .   
He still sounded spooked .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
I do n’t have all of the information , but she got to that point by being one of the masterminds and playing the game well .   
She was aggressive when the city was vulnerable and she was passive when it was n’t .   
The moment Gold Morning came around , I get the impression she mobilized hard , she was ready to expand and capitalize on the situation with more of that aggression .   
Again , I ’m not
100 % on all of that .   
But I can say with reasonable confidence that she ’s one of the most dangerous , capable people on Gimel .
”
“ What am I supposed to do , then ?
”
“ I do n’t know , ” I said .
Sveta elbowed me .   
“ You have to give him more than that .   
You ca n’t scare him and not give him something .
”
“ Please , ” Rain said .
I thought for a few seconds .
“
She bleeds , ” I said .   
“
She gets tired , and she looked really fucking tired when I saw her .   
She has a lot on her plate , and I do n’t think you ’re a primary focus .   
Which is good .   
You do n’t want to be her primary focus , because people who are tend to end up in pieces , one way or another .
”
“ Alright , ” Rain said , sounding anything but .
“
She … ”
I started .   
I bit my tongue .
“
What ? ”
Tristan asked .
“ I do n’t want to jump to conclusions .   
I do n’t want to give you the wrong impressions , either .
”
“
Any impressions help , ” Tristan said .
“ I do n’t know , ” I said .   
“
But what she said when I talked to her , the way she wanted to make herself out to be one of the good guys , bringing good things to others …
”
“
Oh , ” Kenzie said .   
She fiddled with her phone .
“
It does n’t necessarily jibe with her working with people who are out for blood and murder .   
She seems to want to be a very low - key villain or even a Robin - Hood type desperado while simultaneously leaving a trail of bodies in her wake , or she wants to portray herself as such ,
” I said .
“
I ’m now sharing the love and bringing some of that security , stability , and safety to others , in my very , very roundabout way , ”   
Kenzie ’s phone said , in Tattletale ’s voice .
“
Yeah , that ’s it , thank you , ”
I said .   
Kenzie gave me a thumbs up .   
I felt a bit of the heebie - jeebies at having heard Tattletale ’s voice without being braced for it .   
It took me a moment to gather my thoughts before I added , “ It makes me wonder what she would say if she were told that Snag and the other two were out for your head .
”
“
She could be full of shit , ” Sveta said .
“
She could be , ” I admitted .   
“ Trouble of dealing with masterminds is you ca n’t ever know .
”
“ Makes me think , ” Tristan said .   
“
We really should have that talk about our group ’s game plan .
”
“ We ca n’t have that talk without Ashley , ” Kenzie said .
“ Or Chris , ” Sveta said .
Kenzie turned to look at Chris , before giving us a very unenthused , “ Yeah .
”
“ Pretty quick turnaround on your opinion of Chris , ” I said .
“
It ’s not turned around .   
It ’s a love - hate relationship , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Sometimes I really like him
and sometimes I really do n’t .   
Right now is one of those times I really do n’t .   
I was having fun .
”
“
There will be other times you can fool around with my power , and with others , ” Rain said .
“
Yeah , ” Kenzie said .   
She looked at Rain and smiled .   
“ We ’re gon na help you with your thing .
”
A bit of
a non - sequitur ,
but I was n’t going to draw attention to it .   
“
Do you want to call Ashley or see what ’s holding her up ?   
If she ’s not up to having this conversation , that ’s okay too .
”
“
I ’ll call her , ” Kenzie said , hopping up from her seat .   
She wandered off , her eyehook holding her phone to her ear .
“
I ’ll get Chris , ” Sveta said .
As Sveta vacated the space on the bench to my left , I turned to the laptop to my right .   
I typed up a few things about Rain ’s power , then paged up and down some to look at the entries for the individual powers .   
There was a lot more to write up before I had an actual outline I could pitch to the Wardens .   
If they were even interested in working with the overarching cape community on that level .
I hoped they were .   
The villains had a lot of advantages , from the fact they often had the initiative to the fact that their work often made money , and the fact that the chaos and damage they wrought often created more opportunities , henchmen , and money for them .   
Heroes who did well , conversely , often put themselves out of work .
One of the few advantages our side had was that the heroes tended to work together .   
If we did it right , we walked away with allies .   
I had people like Gilpatrick , Crystal , and Mrs. Yamada .
“
How ’s Erin ?
” Tristan asked .
“
She ’s good .   
She ’s applying for jobs today .   
We ’re in an awkward spot for it , though , not many locations , a lot of people around our age want those jobs , and it ’s a long drive in to get to work .   
I think those places open at six .   
It might mean waking up at four to get to work on time .
”
Sveta dragged Chris to the collection of rocks , benches , and seats .   
Chris climbed up to his seat , sitting on the rock Kenzie had been using .   
I was pretty clear
he was still blind , from the way he stared off into space .
“
There are times I do n’t get to sleep until four , ” Chris said , talking to the open air .
“
That ’s not good , ” Sveta said .   
“
Do n’t do that .
”
“
It ’s a chance to be independent , ” Tristan said .   
“
If she can get the job .   
She gives off a good impression , so I can imagine it happening .
”
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .
“
Who is she ?
” I asked .   
“
Can I ask ?
”
“ Just a friend , ” Rain said .   
“
I ’ve always grown up in the middle of nowhere , so when my family was getting settled after Gold Morning , we saw all the incentives they were offering to people willing to get a headstart on agriculture and it seemed natural , you know ?
”
“
Sure , ” I said .
“
Erin ’s
parents were kind of the opposite .   
City people through and through , something in them broke after Gold Morning .   
They could n’t bring themselves to join the rat race again , I think .   
They were given the option for the simple life and they took it .   
Erin got dragged with .
”
“
And you connected .
”
“
She was having a hard time , because y’know , she stands out when a lot of people are hurt and angry and looking to lash out .   
She went looking for a hiding place and she stumbled on my workshop .   
She ’s been a real help , from before I even had the therapy , helping me get figured out , listening to me , helping me research .   
I … do n’t really know what she gets out of the deal , from me .
”
“ I can think of a few things she gets from you , ” Tristan said .
“ I appreciate you saying that , I ’m not sure I see it though , ” Rain said .
I saw Kenzie react to Ashley
’s appearance before I saw Ashley .   
She made her way up the less sloped side of the hill , holding a pair of water bottles .
“
Having a friend with powers is pretty neat , ” I said to Rain .
“
Yeah .   
For sure , ” he said .
“
And while I do n’t know you that well , you seem very thoughtful .
”
“
And there ’s the brooding , mysterious part of it , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Girls like that .   
You and Chris are similar like that .
”
“ I see , ” Rain said .   
He frowned a bit .
“
I ’m
picturing the expression on your face , ” Chris said , before laughing .
“ How long ’s he going to be blind ?
” I asked .
“ Could be ten minutes , could be an hour or two , ” Kenzie said , as she skip - walked over to sit down at Ashley ’s side as Ashley took her seat .
An hour or two ?
“
You got anywhere to be , Chris ?
” I asked .
“
No family , nobody that cares that much , ” he said .   
“
I ’m one of the lost boys , living in the institution .
”
“ I know what that ’s like , ” Kenzie said .   
“
The institution .   
It ’s not fun .
”
“
Personally ?   
I do n’t give a shit , and they do n’t give a shit about me , I could disappear tomorrow and nobody would blink .
”
“
We ’d blink , ” Kenzie said .
“ You would , ” Chris said .   
“
But you ’re lame like that .
”
“ I ’m sorry to hear about your situation , ” I said .
“
It ’s fine , ” Chris said , with emphasis , still staring off into space .   
Blindly , he rummaged in one pocket , pulling out a plastic kit .   
“
It’s-
it ’s freeing .   
All I care about is that I eat three square meals , since nourishment matters for my power , and having a place to sleep .   
Strip away everything else , and
it ’s all any of us want .
”
“ Some of us want people to keep close to us , ” Kenzie said .
“
Not me , ” Chris said .   
He opened the kit and drew out a pair of pliers .
“
Your opinions may change as you hit puberty , ” Tristan said .
“
I ’m already started on that , I ’m not going to go into any details , and I really do n’t think my feelings are going to change , ” Chris replied .   
He seemed to reconsider , then said , “ I really hope they do n’t .
”
I glanced at Ashley .   
She ’d been quiet since sitting down .   
The last time I ’d reached out had n’t ended well .   
Was I supposed to ignore her now , leave her alone while she wound herself down ?
“
How about we talk about your idea , Tristan ?
” I asked .
“
It ’s getting later in the afternoon , ” Sveta said .   
“
And Kenzie has dinner with her parents .   
It would be good to get it out of the way .
”
“ I can skip it if I have to , ” Kenzie said .
“ You should n’t , ” I said .
Tristan shifted position , metal sliding against smooth stone .   
“
The plan .   
We ’ve only got the broad strokes worked out , so if you want to help hammer it out , Victoria , it would really help .
”
“ Okay .
”
“
Protecting Rain in the coming weeks is essential .   
My starting point for thinking about this plan was thinking how we might cover all the bases we want to cover .   
We need to keep the older members of the group free enough to help Rain with whatever he needs help with .   
Kenzie wants to do something integral to the group , and while she can help keep an eye out , it ’s easy for her to take too much of a backseat role .
”
“
Am I taking a frontseat role then ?
”
“
I’m- not exactly .   
There ’s a lot about this that ’s counterintuitive .   
My first instinct is to think , hey , I want to make money , I want to be out there doing things .   
But that leaves us open to interference and distraction .   
So … what if we go covert ?
”
“ Covert ?
” I asked .
“
Nobody knows Ashley is on the side of the good guys for the time being .   
She ’s really good at the villainous persona and atmosphere .
”
“
Thank you , ” Ashley said .
“
And then there ’s Chris , who can be monstrous , appear , disappear , then show up again as someone or something else .
”
I glanced at Chris .   
Chris had two sets of pliers in his mouth .   
He was readjusting his braces .
“
The masterminds and the organizations are masterminding and getting organized .   
Hollow Point is one example of that , and Tattletale ’s degree of involvement , that ’s another example .   
I did n’t get the impression Tattletale was really aware that we were a team , so I think this works .
”
“ Take all things mastermind with a grain of salt , ” I said .
“
Of course , ” Tristan said , quickly enough that I wondered if he ’d bothered with that grain of salt .   
“
Okay , so what if we do like- actually , it ’s like Victoria
was saying a few minutes ago , about creating and capitalizing on weak points-
”
“
She was telling us more about Tattletale , ” Kenzie told Ashley .
“
Yeah , ” Tristan said .   
“
Look , no rush , we do this slow and careful .   
We put you guys out there , Ashley and Chris can plant cameras , Kenzie handles backend , we gather all the data we can , and we find out what the masterminds are doing and where the organizations are most vulnerable .
”
“
Then we hit them , ” Ashley said .
“ Maybe , ” Tristan said .   
“
Maybe .   
We assess the situation , we maybe even spread disinformation , and then we have discussions , involving other cape teams , maybe .   
If it seems doable , we hit them .   
We have a lot going for us if we want to blitz the enemy or ruin a plan in progress .   
When it ’s time to make our play , we can do big , we can hit hard , and we can move fast .   
If it does n’t seem doable , we sell the info to another cape team .
”
“ I like that you ’re thinking about the money , ” I said .   
“
How do you sustain things if you ’re going ahead and handling the mission on your own ?
”
“
I ’m thinking we do n’t , ” Tristan said .   
“
I ’m not wanting to set up a headquarters , we would n’t necessarily have employees or staff , we can figure something out for costume .
”
“
It ’s a long , hard road to gather that kind of intel and then act on it at just the right time .   
It ’s a test of patience , ” I said .   
“
That patience gets tested further when your pockets are empty .
”
“ I hear you , ” Tristan said .   
“
It helps some that we have a lot of people here who are subsidized or not entirely out on their own .   
Kenzie gets money from her parents , Chris has his meals and shelter through the institution .
“ I think we have an advantage there , ” Sveta said , quiet .   
“
Because the thing that defines us , and I do n’t think it defined the Irregulars like this , and it did n’t define the Wards ,
like Weld described them …
we all need to be out there .   
We need this .   
That makes us stick it out .
”
There were nods around the group .   
Even Chris .   
The heads that were n’t nodding were smiling , like Ashley ’s , or looking very serious in a way that made me sure they were in agreement , like Rain was .
I allowed myself to nod as well .
“
Okay , ” I said .   
“
I might be able to make some recommendations about funding , so you wo n’t be too starved .   
If you think you can gather intel that others might be interested in , I can talk to other teams on your behalf , or I can point you in the right direction if you want to handle that yourselves .   
You ’d tell them you have the capacity to get intel .   
You may or may not want first dibs on these villains , but whatever happens , if they ’ll pay a token amount , you ’ll give up the info .   
It serves a double purpose if you set it up as a dead man
’s switch .   
Worst comes to worst , the authorities get an email letting them know what you were up to and who you were up against .
”
“
They ’d pay for that , you think ?
” Rain asked .   
“
Even if it ’s us saying we ’re taking first dibs , but we ’ll give the info anyway ?
”
“ I think it could be sold to them , ” I said .   
“ Information comes at a premium , and every single team out there is wanting as clear a picture of where things stand as possible .
”
“ I do my thing , Chris does his thing , Kenzie does her thing , ” Ashley said .   
“ Sveta , Tristan and I help Rain in the meantime .   
When we have the intel , we hit them .   
Take out key players , interfere with a key part of their business , and we leave them ruined .
”
“ We maybe hit them , ” Tristan said , with emphasis on ‘ maybe’ .
“ If we spend the time to get that far , you ’ll be itching to see it the rest of the way through , ” Ashley said .
“
And then what ?
”
I asked , before they could get in an argument .
“
Hm ?
”
“
Let ’s assume it ’s a success , or you hand off the intel .   
What follows ?
”
“ Depends on a lot of factors , ” Tristan said .   
“
We could take another piece of data collected on the way and jump off from there , or we do n’t just take money , and we go to another team and we trade intel for intel .   
They tell us if they ’ve got more tough nuts or tricky areas to tackle , and we use that as our next starting point .
” I nodded .
“
What are you thinking ?
” Tristan asked .
“
I … admit this makes a lot of sense .   
It may be harder than you ’re picturing .   
Masterminds cover their asses , organizations have a lot of tools at their disposal .
”
“ If we get six pieces of a twenty - piece puzzle and we realize we ca n’t take things any further , we can still sell that intel , ” Tristan said .
“ Absolutely,’
I said .   
“
I ’m trying to think about how that plays out in the long - term .
”
“ I do n’t know , ” Tristan said .   
“
There ’s the stuff
I just said , but I was mostly thinking about the next few steps .   
I ’d rather make calls based on the now and adapt later , depending on what comes up .
”
“
That ’s fair , ” I said .   
“
I ’m trying to be mindful of consequences , these days .   
You ’d be making enemies , once people realized what you were doing and the role you ’d played .   
If you ’re not careful , Ashley and Chris as background observers are cards you can only play a few times , in a limited fashion .
”
“ You can play me eight times , ” Chris said , pulling the pliers out of his mouth , “ After that they ’ll probably catch on .
”
“ If you do n’t change your head that much , then they ’ll catch on sooner than that , ” Tristan said .
“
On that topic , I ’m not sure I like Chris being out in the field like that , ” Sveta said .
“
I ’m fine , ” Chris said .   
“
I can handle that much .
”
“
I ’m thinking Chris gets involved as a distraction .   
A few minutes at a time , a monster shows up , overturns the status quo .   
The kind of thing we do once every two weeks or once a month .
”
“
Yeah .   
I ’m good with that , ” Chris said .
“ I like it , ” Rain said .   
“
I hate that I ’m a burden at this stage .
”
“
Do n’t worry about that , ” Kenzie said .   
She reached out to give Rain a pat on the knee with her eyehook .   
“
We ’re all burdens in our own screwed up ways .
”
My expression might have betrayed something , because Tristan looked my way .
“ Yea or nay ?
” he asked .
“
It reminds me of the Las Vegas capes , ” I said .   
“ And a bit of Watchdog .
”
“ Is that a bad thing ?
” Tristan asked .
Las Vegas had been damned effective , as had Watchdog .   
But where Las Vegas had been a subtle , careful player with a few questionable , mysterious individuals in their ranks making the most of their backgrounds and skills , much like this team in disposition and direction , they ’d also been a team that had turned villain at a critical time .   
Watchdog had been careful and scrupulous , making measured moves with the best intel and agents they had at their disposal , and Watchdog had n’t survived Gold Morning as an organization .
Those were the only two data points I had , for teams like this .   
Corruption and annihilation .
I could n’t say for sure that it was a bad thing , but I could n’t say it was a good thing either .








The van bobbed with the added weight as I set Kenzie ’s projector - recorder box down .   
As I moved back , I nearly tripped over Kenzie , who had climbed into the van right behind me .
“
I ’ve got the straps , I ’ll tie it down , ” she said .   
“ Thank you for doing the heavy lifting .   
It really helps .
”
“
Sure , ” I said .   
I squeezed past her and climbed down from the back of the van .   
“
For the future , if I ’m using my strength , you probably want to keep more of a distance .   
I would n’t want to bump into you with my power up .
”
“
Oh , okay .
”
With Tristan having laid out his plan , the meeting was done , Tristan ’s creations had been dismantled , the rocky walls and barriers broken down and placed with other rocks , and I had my laptop with my gathered notes in my bag .
Kenzie ’s dad was standing by the door to the van .   
The others were gathered on the sidewalk in front of the library .
“
Are you going to be okay going home alone ?
”
Tristan asked Rain .
“ If you ’d asked me earlier , I ’d have said yes .   
I ’m less sure now , ” Rain said .
“
Sorry , ” I said .
“
No need to be .
”
“ I want you to know what you ’re up against .   
I did n’t do it to scare you , exactly .
”
“ Knowing what I ’m up against and being scared
go hand - in - hand , ” Rain said .   
“
Right now
I ’m
telling myself we do n’t think Tattletale is free enough to be tracking me down right now , and the others are injured or preoccupied .   
I ’m probably safe to get home like this , right ?
”
“
I ’d think so , ” Sveta said .   
“
I ’d offer to come with you , but it ’s a bit of a long trip .
”
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .   
“ I would n’t want you to go to that trouble , either way .
”
“
Have you given any thought to moving ?
” Tristan asked .
Rain shrugged .   
“
Every day .   
Being where I am is tolerable for now , I think .   
The commute to the city is a pain , but if I imagine they ’re hiring a dozen mercenaries and a few others , then it could be a bigger pain for them .
”
“
Hey Flays - Alive - Man , for this job , we ’re going to need you and your ten superpowered friends to catch a train and spend three and a half hours traveling to the middle of nowhere , and then you have to find our target , ” Chris said .
“ God , ” Rain said .   
“ Do n’t fire up my imagination with names like that .
”
“ I do want to focus more on your situation , ” I said .   
“
We ’ve talked about the team and what the group is doing , but your situation is pressing .   
We ca n’t keep assuming they ’re preoccupied .
”
“ I know , ” Rain said .
“
We should figure something out , cover any surprises in the short - term while plotting out something workable in the long - term , ” I said .
“ I agree .   
You can send them the wrong signals , but they could try tripping you up too , ” Tristan said .
“ I know , really , ” Rain said .   
He shifted his weight from one foot to the other , like he was about to say something , then said , “ Yeah .
”
“ I could come with and fly back , or fly over the train and keep an eye out for trouble , ” I said .
I could see Rain ’s reaction , the kneejerk resistance .
“
Oh !   
I have cameras , ” Kenzie said , “ And you could use them to communicate .   
They ’re not too obvious .
”
“
I could carry a camera , ” Rain said .   
“ Just so long as I could turn it off when I need to .
”
“ Why would you need to turn it off ?
” Kenzie asked .
“
Because I have to go to the bathroom sometimes .
”
“
Why would anyone use a camera to watch someone go to the bathroom ?
”
Kenzie asked .   
“
No , wait , I do n’t want to know .   
I ’ve learned my lesson about those sorts of questions .   
But you can trust me ,
that ’s not
what I ’m about .
”
“
I ’m glad .   
I still want an off switch .
”
Kenzie rummaged in the back of the van and pulled out a bag .   
She handed over something looked like a smoke detector in brushed black metal , with a lens in the center .   
“
Here .   
A camera .   
You can press down on the lens in the middle and it will alert me .   
I ’ll set it up so it lets the others know too , but I can pick up sound and visuals and pass it on to the others if you need it .   
This is the battery pack .   
You can pull it out and the camera wo n’t work .
”
“ Seems simple enough .
”
“ Whatever you do , ” Kenzie said , reaching out to touch Rain ’s forearm .   
“ Do not put the battery pack in backward , when you re - insert it .
”
Rain looked down at the camera he held with a little bit of trepidation .
“
Why ?
” I asked .
“
Because then it wo n’t work , ” Kenzie said .
“
You said it in an ominous voice , ” Chris said .
“ It ’ll help Rain to remember not to put it in backward .   
Duh .
”
“
It ’s not going to misfire or blow up ?
” I asked .
“ Why do you keep asking that ?   
No .   
It ’s a camera .   
There is a very small chance of it blowing up , and if it does then it ’s going to be a very small explosion .   
Unless you ’re very unlucky and a lot of the things that could make it blow up all happen at once .
”
“ I guess I trust your tech more than I trust the people who are after me to leave me alone , ” Rain said .   
He held up the camera .   
“
I ’ll hold onto this , then .   
Thanks .
”
“ Cool , ” Kenzie said .   
“
You ’re welcome .
”
“ You ’re not going to be looking through it and checking in on me at random , right ?
”
“ Not if you do n’t want me to , ” Kenzie said .
“ I do n’t want you to , ” Rain said .   
“
No offense .   
It ’s just that the less you know , the less likely it is that one of the people after me decides to come after one of you to try to get info .
”
“
Okay , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Not a problem .
”
It ’s a bit of a problem , I thought .   
But not like you ’re imagining .
Kenzie looked back toward her dad .   
“
And I should go .   
You know how to get in contact if you have questions .   
Do you want a ride ?   
Does anyone ?
”
“
No thanks , ” Rain said .
Kenzie double and triple checked with the rest of us , then looked over at her dad , who was waiting with barely any change in expression .   
“
I ’m going to head out then .   
Bye guys .
”
“ Bye , ” Sveta said .
“ Talk to you again soon , ” I said .
Kenzie climbed into the passenger seat .   
Her dad glanced over the group , briefly making eye contact with me , before taking a seat behind the wheel .   
She stuck her hand out the window to give us a bit of a wave as her dad pulled away .
“ Most uncomfortable car ride ,
” Rain said , watching them go .
“
What ’s that ?
” I asked .
“ Julien Martin , giving me a ride earlier .   
Kenzie sent me a text letting me know he was on his way to pick me up .   
I would have said no if she ’d asked beforehand .   
He turned up , let me into the car , then the entire way here , did n’t say a single word .   
I did n’t say a thing either .
”
“
Am I missing context ?
” I asked .
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .
“
It ’s context for Kenzie to share , ” Sveta said , her voice firm .
“
Yeah , ” Rain said , again .
“ Fair , ” I said , even though I was n’t sure it was .   
Not a hundred percent .   
There was a point where I could n’t do everything I needed to do if people were keeping secrets .   
I did n’t want to press any buttons or tread on anything sensitive , and there were a lot of buttons and a lot of sensitive points .
“ We ’ll get you up to speed soon , ” Sveta said .   
“
But we have to be fair .
”
“
Out of curiosity , Sveta , how much wear and tear did your body take out there ?   
Or is it bad of me to ask ?
” Tristan asked .
“
It ’s not bad at all , ” Sveta said .
The conversation turned to armor and costumes .   
I listened with one ear , but my thoughts were on Sveta ’s defense of Kenzie ’s background , and how careful Tristan was in asking about Sveta ’s body .
There was something I ’d noticed with the group , and it was something I ’d fallen prey to myself .   
When the group was talking , it was almost always in a guarded way .   
Even Chris did it to a small degree .   
Ashley too .   
Conversations were meted out with care , not necessarily so each person was protecting themselves , but so they protected each other .   
We often slipped back into talking like we were in therapy .
There were cases where individuals protected themselves and cases where individuals were also protected by others .   
Kenzie had a role as the baby of the team , in a way .   
There were things she did n’t disclose and things she was intentionally or unintentionally coy about , despite her overly open personality .   
That was compounded by how others were ready to step up for her and defend her .   
That was the security they ’d given her .
I glanced over my shoulder at Ashley , who was hanging back , finishing the second of the bottles of water she ’d brought back with her after going to the library .   
Ashley was very similar to Kenzie in that department .   
Unguarded in terms of how open she was about many things , but she had things she did n’t talk about , and she benefited heavily from the group ’s defense of her .
It was the contract between them , the language they used and their habits , it carried over from the group .   
It was going to change over time , I was sure , especially if their therapy with Mrs. Yamada ran its course .   
I was n’t sure if that meant the dialogue would become natural , if the contract would be betrayed in small ways , or both .
I was , as much as they ’d asked for my help , the interloper .   
They protected each other from me , even if it meant Sveta was protecting someone as troubled as Ashley from someone she saw as a friend .   
I suspected it ran deeper than her wanting to see Ashley ’s humanity win out over the monster .
Getting the information on powers and on the most important things like Ashley ’s situation was easily doable , because it was need - to - know .   
Where I ran into a stumbling block was that their view on need - to - know and my view differed .
I worried they had too light a view of things .   
The ones who did n’t were among the more guarded , and they were being guarded too .
It all knotted together .   
Was I supposed to be patient and wait for the information to come out ?   
Would it come out only as each crisis reared its head ?   
Or did I push and risk doing damage ?
I could push lightly .   
I waited for Tristan to stop talking about his armor , and the tools he used to fix the scuffs .
I was n’t the only one waiting for a break in the conversation .   
“
I should probably go or I ’m going to miss my train .
”
“
My offer stands , ” I said .   
“
An eye in the sky , if you think you ’ll need it .
”
“
No , ” Rain said .  
“ I ’d rather-
”
He stopped at that .
“
What ? ”
Tristan asked .
Rain went on , “
It ’s my experience that when you ’re in trouble , people are usually pretty good about offering help and support .  
People are good like that .  
I ’ve seen it with family members that had babies , and people who lost loved ones .  
Everyone turns up and offers their support , they bring food , they say they ’ll be there .  
And they are , at first .
”
“ You think we ’ll get bored of this and not help you later ?
” Tristan asked .
“ Not bored , ” Rain said .  
“
Shit happens .  
Everyone has their issues , things come up , and then they lose sight of the promises made to new parents , the bereaved , or whoever else .
”
“ I think that ’s pretty unfair , ” Tristan said .
“ It ’s reality , ” Rain said .   
He looked at me , “
It ’s nice of you to offer , Victoria , but I ’d rather have you come and keep an eye on things when I feel
like I ’m actually in danger , instead of coming now , realizing what a huge pain in the ass
it is to fly that far out of your way , and then feeling reluctant when it counts .
”
I thought about reassuring him , pointing out that I ’d traveled from the Bridgeport span to the portal in New Haven to Brockton Bay , several times a week , to get notes , check on the wreckage of the house and visit Crystal ’s family .  
I did n’t .
“ Gotcha , ” I said .   
I ’d pushed , I was n’t going to push harder now that the boundary had been raised .
“
You ’re still blind , Chris ?
” Sveta asked .
“ Yep .  
It ’s starting to come back , though .  
Thirty minutes to an hour , I think .
”
“
Do you want someone to stay with you ?
” Sveta asked .
“
No .  
Hell no .  
Then I ’d feel obligated to make conversation and shit , ” Chris said .   
“
It ’s a sunny day , there ’s a breeze , the weather is perfect .  
I ’m going to sit outside and wait
and then I ’ll make my way back to the institution .
”
“ They wo n’t be bothered if you ’re late for dinner ?
” I asked .
“
So long as I ’m there by lights out , they do n’t care .  
They ’ve got twenty staff and over a thousand kids in the building with dead or missing parents .  
I eat or I feed myself ,
I mostly do the chores
I ’m assigned
, I ’m there when I ’m supposed to be .  
There ’s lots of others who demand more attention than I do .
”
“
It sounds like the children at your institution are pretty vulnerable , ” Sveta said .  
“
Nobody paying attention to what they ’re doing with their days .  
Any of you could be pressed into work or preyed on or you could end up disappearing , and nobody would know .
”
“
Not me , ” Chris said .  
“
They ’d regret it if they tried with me .  
With triggers being a thing , they might regret it whoever they try it with .
”
I was put in mind of my mom .  
“ It does n’t mean the damage is n’t done before powers come into the picture .
”
“
Yeah , well , I dunno , ” Chris said .  
“ I ’m going to relax and wait until my vision comes back .  
If it takes too long or if I run into trouble , I ’ve got another change I was wanting to make today .  
Keen Vigilance .  
Perception focused .  
It ’ll give me a fresh set of eyes .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .
The others got themselves sorted out .   
Rain , Sveta , and Tristan started their walk to the train station .   
Chris retreated toward the library .
Ashley remained by the sidewalk , drinking her water .   
She ’d been dead quiet .
“
You good ?
”
I asked her .
“ I was dead for years .  
I ’ve been operated on , feeling every last movement of the scalpel , several times .   
This is nothing , so
yeah ,
I ’m good .
”
She put a curious inflection on the word .
It was eerie to think of Bonesaw ’s involvement in things .   
Her handling of Ashley here , how the Slaughterhouse Nine had got Blasto which had led to Fume Hood ’s downward spiral .   
It made me think of Crawler , and it made me think of what had happened to my home town .
To my home , my living room shattered with monsters left lying in places where childhood memories were supposed to be .   
Monsters that had once been people , a few of them genuinely good and decent .
Heroes , even .
To my family .   
To the person who had once been closest to me .
“
Right .   
Good to hear , ” I said .
“
We ’re similar , I think , ” she said .
I paused .   
I ’d been taking a second to think about how I would gracefully exit .   
Now I was left to process what she ’d said , and figure out how to gracefully answer that .
“
Should I take that as a compliment ?
” I asked .
“ Take it however you like .   
Them ?   
They ’ve experienced hurt .   
They ’ve known horror .   
Maybe not so much for Kenzie , but she experienced enough hurt that it balances out .
”
“
I probably should n’t be hearing this , ” I said .
“
They have n’t seen the worst of it .   
They have n’t seen rock bottom and then had someone or something reach up from below and drag them deeper .   
The Slaughterhouse Nine were that for me .   
I got the impression from how you talked about Tattletale that she was that for you .
”
No , I thought .   
Only in small part .
“
My first take on you was that you knew enough to be useful .   
Then you talked about Tattletale , and your reaction to someone who has the information , who ’s careful , and who has resources ?   
You ’re afraid .
”
“ I ’m concerned , ” I said .
“ I respect it , that fear .
”
“
Concern , ” I said .   
“ If it was just fear for myself , that would be one thing .   
But I ’m concerned about the others here .
”
“
It ’s a very concerning world , is n’t it ?
” she asked .   
“
There ’s a lot to be concerned about .   
You and I , we have our eyes open about that , even if we ’re taking it in very different directions .
”
“
Are we ?
” I asked .   
“ Are n’t you giving this hero thing an honest shot ?
”
“ I am .   
It ’s not going to work out , but I ’ll be here until the end .
”
“
You sound pretty sure about the fact that it ’s going to go south .
”
She tipped back her water bottle , finishing it off , and without even lowering the bottle from her mouth , used her power .   
Shorter than her prior uses , abrupt .   
It made its usual cacophony of noise , my ears ringing faintly in its wake , and it pushed her hair up and back , so it took    a second to fall back into place .
She caught her balance , taking a second before she stood straight again .   
Then she looked at me with eyes that had no pupils , no irises , only the white , and only the dark makeup to draw out the eyelashes .   
Slowly , her pupils faded back in .
All to dispose of a water bottle , apparently , or to make a point .
“
I ’m not even the most fucked up person on this team , Victoria , ” she said .   
“ I might not even be in the top two .   
Our therapist knows , and that ’s why she was concerned enough to reach out to you .   
They , the really fucked up ones , they probably know .   
But I know it too , which makes me pretty certain .
”
“
Yet you ’re still here , ” I said .
“
So are you .
”
“ I ’m cursed with an impulse to help people , ” I said .
“
It ’s an epidemic , ” she said .
“
Guess
so , ” I said .   
I used my flight , my feet rising an inch or two off the ground .   
“
I think I ’m going to take off .
”
She gave me a small salute , her expression dispassionate .
I did n’t want to give the impression I was running , so I asked , “ See you in a couple of days , then ? ”
“
Yeah .
” I flew skyward , at the speed and angle that made even my stomach do that overly light flip - flop at the distance between myself and solid earth .   
I came to a stop when I could n’t see the library anymore .
I did n’t fly home .   
I had too many thoughts in my head , and after seeing the others , seeing personalities and outbursts from Tristan
’s comments for Byron to Ashley ’s more dire threats , the powers , the secrets that were being kept or barely suppressed …
I remained in the air , the ground a blur beneath me , the clouds not all that far above me .   
The city was painted in its golds , its concrete and pavement with yellow paint , its grassy patches , its fields of wheat and corn .
Just me up here , the wind in my ears .
I believed Ashley .   
It was n’t that she was honest , she was n’t .   
She bluffed and she bluffed often .   
I suspected the bluffs were because she ’d been telling me the truth when she ’d remarked on the common thread between us : we ’d seen some of the worst the world had to offer and we had reason to be afraid .
I believed her when she said there were people on the team who she saw as more ‘ messed up’ than herself .   
I had my suspicions about who .
Something was up with Chris .   
Mentally and emotionally he was compromised .   
Physically , compromised .   
Socially , in terms of where he fit into the world , again , he was compromised .   
He ’d almost revealed the least of himself of anyone present .
Rain was another issue .
The team supported and insulated its members , they protected one another from the interlopers and the outside stresses .   
There were times and places that could be good , but I could just as easily see things go in a direction where outsiders were n’t sufficiently protected from the group , while the group carried on like this .
My job , in a way .
I ’d keep an eye on all of them , of course .   
Kenzie could be a danger , and I could see even Sveta going to a bad place , however much I liked her .   
Tristan was strong , and he spent half of his life locked away in a lightless , motionless prison , only a window that looked out through his brother ’s eyes and listened through his brother ’s ears .   
It would be so easy for him to go off the deep end .   
Ashley was unpredictable and dangerous , pure and simple .
Chris I could only keep an eye on .   
Rain-
I did n’t fly back to Crystal
’s .
I flew to the train station , and I held a position where I could n’t make out the people , but I could make out the train .
I was paranoid , and too many things today had prodded at my paranoia .   
There were many I was helpless to do much about , but I could act on these suspicions .
A train came , traveling west - to - east .   
I knew Sveta and Tristan would be boarding it .   
Had I been on foot , it was the one I would have caught .
When the other train came , traveling the opposite direction , I followed it .   
I had a pit in my stomach , doing it , but I had a gut feeling that this was part of why Jessica had reached out to me , and why she had been relieved that I was keeping an eye on things .
Yes , they knew things about each other .   
But they kept secrets .   
There were evasions , walls that were thrown up .
I just did n’t understand what Rain was doing .   
To have a hit out on his head and reject an escort , holding firm to that rejection even after having the danger driven home ?
“
What ’s going on , Rain ?
” I asked .   
Where I was , suspended in the sky , wind rushing past me , there was nobody to hear .
I was prepared to follow him to Greenwich .   
It was a lengthy trip , and it left me to think about grabbing dinner , possibly on the trip back .   
I tempted myself with thoughts of a burger or a good souvlaki roll .   
Something warm , as I thought on it .   
This high up , there was no heat radiating up off the ground or nearby surfaces , less sunlight bouncing around with light energy dissipating and becoming heat , and the steady wind flowed past me to swipe the warmth that my body put out .   
As stakeouts went , this was liable to be cold , and I ’d have to figure out something for bathroom breaks .
As self - imposed missions went , it was n’t just hard for me to justify doing this , it was a pretty rough experience .   
The mind - numbing dullness of a sit - and - watch stakeout combined with the hypnotic nature of a long - distance drive .   
Drivers , at least , had to watch the road and be mindful of other drivers .   
I had nothing to help keep my thoughts centered .
From Stratford to Bridgeport .   
I had my binoculars out , and I watched for trouble , studying the people boarding the train .
Nothing obvious .
The train carried on its way , traveling from the Bridgeport neighborhood to Fairfield span , past the community center that had been attacked at Norfair , and then onward to Norwalk station .   
Kenzie ’s neighborhood .
There were stops where only a pair of people left , stops where only a few got on , and Norwalk , unfortunately , was one of the major stations .   
I could n’t track everyone that boarded .
My thoughts were preoccupied , thinking about what I was doing , my doubts , my frustration that I could n’t effectively watch out for trouble while doing this the way I was doing it .   
It was too easy for someone with powers to board the train and go after Rain while uncostumed .   
Was it likely ?   
No .   
But I wanted to justify what I was doing .
There was a chance , though , that when Rain got off the train , he would be followed by fellow passengers until he was in a place where he could be attacked .   
I could watch out for that .
I could watch out for any unexpected stops , and I could keep an eye out for the old staples of railway robberies and ambushes – trains moved slowest when they went around corners , so I could keep an eye out for ambushes and unexpected boardings that took place in those locations .
With my thoughts caught up in things as they were , I nearly missed it .
The train was old - fashioned in look , cars linked by couplings , and passengers could move between cars , with the space between each car being open to the air .   
Periodically passengers would step out to smoke or get fresh air .   
Most were parents with kids .
At the caboose , a figure had stepped out onto the back .   
Rain .
He climbed over the railing and jumped , while the train was going well over a hundred miles an hour .
Hands out to his side , his bag in one hand , other empty , his feet touched the slope , and he stopped .   
No momentum , nothing to suggest he ’d been on a speeding train a matter of seconds ago .   
The fact he stood on a slope did n’t seem to matter , as he did n’t slide , slip , or fall .
He looked around , but he did n’t look up , and I was n’t sure he would have seen me if he had .   
He jogged down the slope , and walked across a field .   
Past the field was mostly wilderness and dirt road .
Rain walked for ten minutes to get where he was going .   
Erin had parked under a modest little bridge in a town with one gas station .
I did n’t feel good , watching them interact .   
I felt guilty for spying , even though his actions proved he was being dishonest .   
I watched Rain make conversation with his friend .   
Minutes , where he did most of the talking , pacing some , while Erin leaned against the side of the vehicle .
He must have asked something , because Erin shifted position , reaching through the window .   
A second later , she drew her hand out .   
She had a handgun .
It did n’t mean anything .   
This was justifiable , given his situation .   
Lying about where he lived and where he was going was justifiable .   
Even his friend carrying a gun made sense , when he was being hunted .
His story about how they met and where she came from
… I was n’t sure .   
It did n’t feel like I knew the whole of it .
If they ’d traveled again , I might have watched to see where they went .   
If they ’d gone to one of the smaller equivalents of Hollow Point , it might have told me something .   
If they met certain people , it might have proven out my suspicion .
They went to get ice cream in the dinky one gas - station town , and I could n’t conscience staying to watch .
I flew home .
⊙ I let myself into Crystal ’s apartment through the sliding balcony door .
“ …
ave site ?
” a male voice .
“
Whenever I ’m traveling in that direction , ” Crystal said .
“
That ’s good to hear .   
I keep meaning to travel out that way , but … ” “ It ’s a universe away .   
I can go with you sometime , if you want .
”
“ That might be nice .
”
I shut the balcony door .   
I could have closed it silently , but I did n’t .
Crystal , standing at one corner of the living room , had the door open , but she stood in between the door and doorframe in such a way that her body filled the gap .   
She twisted around to look at me , and I saw a forcefield start to be painted out .
“
It ’s okay , ” I said .
The forcefield winked out .
“
You sure ?
” she asked .
I nodded .
She opened the door wider .   
My dad was in the hallway , wearing a sleeveless top with a hood , in a very light fabric , and yoga pants of similar light weight .   
A gym bag sat on the floor by his feet .
“
You ’ve been flying , ” he said .
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“
That ’s good , ” he said .   
“
That ’s really positive .
”
“ I guess , ” I said .   
“
How are you ?
”
“
I ’m noticing how empty my apartment feels , a lot .   
That ’s not me trying to guilt you .   
It ’s me realizing where I ’ve wound up and wondering how I got myself here .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“
Do you want to invite him in ?
”
Crystal asked .   
“
I can fuck off if you need me to .   
Or you can take over door duty ?
”
“ I would n’t ask you to fuck off in your own place .   
Are you getting tired of standing guard ?
” I asked .
“ A bit .
”
“
We can invite him in .
”
My dad entered the apartment .   
“
Sorry to drop in .
”
“
Is that what this is ?
”
“
I worry , when you drop all communication .   
I thought I would at least ask Crystal if you were okay .
”
“ I see , ” I said .   
I walked around behind the couch , putting it between myself and him , and leaned forward on the back of it .
He took a seat on the armrest of the armchair , one foot on the ground .   
“ I want you to know that what happened at your mom
’s
house , I ’m sorry about that .   
It was n’t right .
”
“ I appreciate that .   
I …
I wish I could tell you that I was sorry for how I reacted there .   
But I do n’t know if I can .
”
“ I would n’t ask you to , ” he said .   
“
I think any and all of us should be understanding when it comes to old wounds .
”
Old wounds , I thought .
Were they that old ?   
Did n’t ‘ old’ presume they ’d healed over or that things had been addressed or mended somehow ?
“ I guess , ” I said .   
“
What mom did
, I was pretty vocal about why I was upset about it .   
Did Crystal explain why I was bothered by what you did ?
”
“
She deflected my question when I asked .
”
“ If you noticed it was a deflection , ” Crystal said , “ I need to work on my patter more .
”
“ Just a bit more , ” my dad said , smiling slightly .
“
Sorry to interrupt , ” she said .
“
It ’s okay , ” I said .   
I paused .   
“ You realize , dad , the reason I felt betrayed was n’t that I thought you were in on it or anything , right ?   
I felt betrayed because you let yourself believe mom ’s words more than you believed everything you saw in years of living with me , after visiting me in the asylum , after seeing how I function and how I do n’t function .
”
“
I ’m not going to try to defend myself , ” he said .   
“
You ’re absolutely right .   
I let myself be stupid .   
I have a way of doing that when I ’m around your mom .
”
“ I just do n’t understand how you would n’t just stop and realize it does n’t make sense .   
When you know about the nightmares and the fact I had n’t flown in months , and the fact I do n’t even want to talk about her , you ’ll believe I ’d be willing to meet her face to face and have a meal ?
”
“
It ’s not that clear cut .   
Your mother is a clever woman , to the point she can outsmart herself .   
She has good instincts when it comes to getting people on her side , too .   
I ’ve been missing home , the past few years , and seeing the woman I still love being warm for the first time in …
”
He trailed off .
“ Since twenty - eleven , ” I said .
“
Yeah , ” my dad said .   
“ With food
I ’ve been aching for for just as long already cooking , the kitchen and barbecue rich with that smell .   
Things , like I said , that make me stupid .
”
“
What food was it ?
” I asked .
“
Laser seared kebabs , ” Crystal said .
I bit my lip .   
Family recipe .   
With my lip still between my teeth , I said , “ Okay .
”
“ I ’m not making excuses , ” my dad said .   
“ I should have clued in .   
When Amy turned up and I knew you were coming , it was n’t framed like a reconciliation .   
It was framed as you knowing everyone was coming
and you would have things to get off your chest .   
Carol said she would referee
and I knew it would go poorly if it was just her ,
so I offered to help .   
While I was offering I was n’t stopping to think .
”
“ Was a part of it you just wanting things to be normal again ?   
The four person nuclear family back together ?
”
“
Yes , ” he said .   
“
I ’m not about to lie here .   
I-
yeah .   
Yes .
”
It hurt , hearing that .   
Knowing my dad and where he wanted to be were that far away from where I was and where I wanted to be .
“
I ’m sorry , ” he said .   
“
I let my guard down when I should have had it up to protect you .   
I wanted you to hear that apology , and I wanted to make sure you were alright .
”
“ Crystal and I are looking after each other , ” I said .
“
Absolutely , ” Crystal said .
“
That ’s great , ” my dad said .
I rubbed my arm , wrist to shoulder .   
“ I ’m
giving some limited direction to a team of heroes right now .   
It ’s messy .
”
“ Any team is bound to be .   
It ’s good that you ’re doing that .
”
“
Messier than most , ” I said .   
I paused .   
“
Top one percent of messy .
”
“
Ah , I see , ” my dad said .   
He rubbed his chin .   
It was late enough in the day that the stubble he usually had on his chin was more of a shadow .   
“
The Dallon - Pelham family never does anything the easy way , does it ?
”
“
No we do n’t , ” I said .
“
Can I help ?
” he asked .   
“ Advice , support ?   
I do n’t have a lot of money , but
…
”
“ I ’ve got the team outlined on my laptop .   
Six people , either under eighteen or in the vicinity of eighteen .   
One complicated case , age - wise .   
Um , this does n’t leave this room , right ?
”
Nods from both Crystal and my dad .
“ They ’ll probably go covert .   
Gather and sell info .   
I think I can pitch that to the big teams and get the initial funding .   
I might be able to get costumes through them as well .
”
“ They have the infrastructure set up for costumes , ” my dad said .   
“ They ’ve got most current members outfitted , and I ’ve heard rumor of them branching out to supply other teams and heroes .   
I would be very surprised if they said it was n’t doable .
”
“
Perfect , ” I said .   
That helped if and when it came to negotiating .   
I held up my hand .   
“ Funding , costumes , target … target is hard to pin down .   
A lot of low - level threats out there , banding together .
”
“ If you ’re keeping an eye out for the criminal populations that are n’t joining larger groups , the places you want to keep an eye on are the Cabin , the Tea - Shop , the Pitstop , the Rail , and the Greens .   
Those last three places are pretty seedy and traditional villain bars .   
The others are villain bars without the bar part .
”
“ What about the ones who are hooked into bigger groups ?
” I asked .
“ That gets more complicated , and it ’s less about the places to watch and more about the names to keep an ear out for , ” my dad said .   
“ Marquis , Goddess , Lord of Loss , Mama Mathers , the Crowley brothers , Deader and Goner , Barrow .
”
I knew the names
and I knew where they were situated .   
No big surprises there .   
I nodded to myself .   
Marquis .   
So casually mentioned .
“
How messy is it ?
”
my dad asked , his voice softer .
“
They ’re young , some of them are kids , and I ’m not positive they ’re all going to survive the next two weeks ,
” I said .   
“
And that ’s not even-
there ’s enough other mess I could almost forget about that danger hanging over their heads .
”
“ You ’ve taken them under your wing ?
”
“
Yep .   
I ’m going to at least point them in the right direction , I hope .   
I might be the wrong person for the job , but someone has to do it , right ? ”
“
Wow , ” my dad said , barely audible .
“
What ? ”
He shook his head .   
“
It ’s hard to articulate .
”
“
I ’m trying to play this slow , keep it calm .   
I know a lot
and I ’ve been down some of these roads .   
I ’m hopeful I can at least keep things from getting out of control .
”
“ That may be a tall order , ” Crystal said .
“ Maybe , ” I said .   
“ If they absolutely insist on getting out there and mixing things up , I ’ll point them in the direction of the asshole villains who are ramping up their activity and taking things over .   
The nascent Tattletales and Marquises .   
Kneecap them or their plans before they can get too big .
”
“
You really are your mother
’s
daughter , ” my dad said .
My eyebrows went about as high up as they could as I turned my full attention toward him .
“
What you said before , and what you said just now .   
Those words could have come from her mouth in a different time and place .
”
“ This is n’t winning points with me , ” I said .
“
I ’m not here to win points , ” he said .   
“ I want to make sure you ’re safe , sane , and healthy .
”
I noticed the implication of what he was saying .   
That taking this course might not be one of those three things .
“
What should I be doing different ?
” I asked .
“ I do n’t know , ” he said .   
“
I do n’t think any of it is wrong , but I have n’t always been the best judge in the moment .   
I ’d say CYA .
”
“
On what front ?
” I asked .
“
Do you have counsel on call ?
”
“ I was n’t aware we even had a legal system yet .
”
“ We do n’t , but it ’s coming soon .
”
Counsel on call .   
It was common for new teams of heroes to have a lawyer available , who they could call and outline the situation to before they took action .   
Covering their asses , making sure the arrests could stick , that there was a voice with the authority and knowledge to talk to the police and courts if and when the heroes’ actions were questioned in more depth .
It was n’t a bad idea .   
It hobbled things , slowed them down , it was a bit of a headache … but having a lawyer as a hoop to jump through could restrain some of the more impulsive parts of the team .   
I ’d have to run it by them , but it made sense .
“ I could ask around , ” my dad offered .   
“
But if you really wanted a good perspective on who you could talk to , there are better people to ask .
”
“ You mean mom , ” I said .
My dad nodded .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
I clenched my fist and relaxed it .   
“
I ’ll talk to her .
”
“
You really want this .
”
I thought of the team when it had been operating together , playing off one another , being good at what they did .   
I thought of Tattletale and her version of my hometown and how much I really wanted her and people like her to lose every reason they had to be smug and confident .
I wanted to bring those two ideas together into a concrete reality , and I wanted it badly enough
I was willing to go
have a conversation with my mom when I was really fucking pissed at her .
If it meant wrangling this team that was going to do what they were doing whether I was involved or not , I ’d do that .
“
I feel like whatever I say , you ’re going to say I ’m just like mom again , and then I ’m going to be mad at you , ” I said .
“
Ca n’t have that , ” my dad said .
“ Putting all of that stuff aside , ” I said .   
“
If I walked away , if I left it alone , I ’m scared of what would happen to people who did n’t deserve it .   
I ca n’t do that .   
I do n’t know if that ’s the Carol in me talking , but it ’s the truth .
”
My dad nodded to himself .   
“
That ’s not
your mom talking ,
I ’m pretty sure .   
Similar , but … not your mom . ”

2 pm at the front doors .   
Take extra time to travel , P.transportation strike may futz things up ⊙ I ’d had to take the train to get to the Wardens’ HQ .   
It was a fortress of a building , indomitable , and it was situated near the largest cluster of portals in Gimel , very possibly the largest cluster of portals in all the known worlds .
I looked    up at a knight in plate armor with his bowed head , both hands on the pommel of a sword , with the tip resting on the ground .   
A cloth wrap partially covered the legs , like a flag worn around the waist , long enough to reach the knees in front , and to drape near the ankles at the back .   
Two shields stood behind the figure , hanging in the air at a height and position reminiscent of folded wings .
It was typically simplified when shrunk down for website images and badges , the position of arms , hands and shields suggesting the lines of a ‘ W’ for the first letter of ‘ Wardens’ .   
Here , it was four stories of statue , built into the front face of the building .
It put me in mind of Gilpatrick ’s speech .   
Five pounds of gun , fifteen pounds of armor ?   
No .   
Here , at this scale , it was fifty tons of sword , a hundred and fifty tons of armor and shield .   
Every inch and pound of its composition was symbolism .
“
It ’s something , is n’t it ?
” Tristan asked .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
It ’s something .
”
I turned to look at him .   
He ’d just walked up to stand beside me .
He ’d tidied his hair some .   
I had the impression he ’d started to dress up for the occasion and his other impulses stylewise had taken over .   
His shirt was a button - up , red silk , with buttons in twos at the regular intervals .   
He wore it very casually , with the sleeves rolled up and the buttons undone at the collarbone .   
He ’d paired it with a nice pair of black jeans , and he ’d painted his hair a red that more closely matched his shirt .
“ Reminds me of that video that circulated online for a bit .   
Chevalier and the last fight against Behemoth , ” Tristan said .
“
Absolutely , ” I said .   
“ Probably intentional .   
It ’s a good mental image to have , the hard fight and the great improvements that follow .
”
“
And the disaster that followed that ?
” Tristan asked .
I frowned at him .
“
It ’s reality , ” he said .
“
It ’s a little pessimistic ,
” I said .   
I glanced back .   
I spotted Sveta making her way up the steps from the sidewalk to the raised bit of ground in front of the building .   
“
Hey !
”
She wore a black dress that gathered together as a halter neck , with tights covering the legs .   
She ’d redone some of the paint on her arms and shoulders , the paint around the ball joint and along the shell that encased each arm fresh and glossy .
“
You guys dressed up a bit , ” I said .
“ We exchanged some texts , ” Tristan said .   
“
I think we psyched each other up some .
”
“
I was redoing my paint after all the running around and tree climbing yesterday , ” Sveta said .   
“ I started overthinking things .
”
“ You look good , ” I said .
“
Thank you .   
You too .
”   
I was wearing a very similar outfit to when I ’d been job hunting .
Kenzie was last to catch up to us , running up the stairs .   
Knee - high socks , a skirt with overlapping stripes , and a blue sweater in a light material , worn over a shirt with the collar poking up through the neckhole .   
The pin in her hair looked like a bow , but it was two - dimensional and metal .
“
Did you go home to change ?
” Tristan asked .
“
No , ” Kenzie said .
“ You actually wore that to school ?
” he asked .
“
It looks nice , thank you very much , ” she said .
“ I agree , ” I said .   
“
I might have worn something similar when I was around Kenzie ’s age .
”
“ I can understand you not getting bullied , ” Tristan told me .   
“
Your parents are superheroes .
”
“ I do n’t get bullied either , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I would n’t mind if I did .   
It would at least mean my classmates would pay attention to me .
”
“ They do n’t ?
” Sveta asked .
“
Feels like everyone ’s busy with their own thing , ” Kenzie said .   
She looked up at the statue that stood in relief from the front of the Wardens’ headquarters .   
“
Still hurting from recent losses .
”
“ We ’ll see what we can do to keep future losses from happening , ” I said .
“
Absolutely , ” Kenzie said .
Inside the building , statues of key members stood off to either side of the lobby .   
Chevalier , Narwhal , Valkyrie , Legend , Cinereal , Stonewall , Topflight and Miss Militia .   
The building was set up so the people on the second , third , and fourth floors could stand at the glass railings and look down at the lobby , and vice versa .   
People in business clothes were walking every which way , upstairs , and people on the ground floor were free to peruse the gift shop or wait for tours .
There were larger display boards set up around the edges of the lobby , much like the maps that were stationed around malls , but these showed off the icons for each of the teams under the Wardens’ umbrella .   
They might have been touchscreens .   
There were screens for Advance Guard , Foresight , the Attendant , the Shepherds , and smaller teams like the Kings of the Hill , the Wayfinders , and the Navigators .   
The screen for the Attendant was still up , but it was dark , only the faint outline of the Attendants’ icon on the screen .   
The Shepherd ’s screen had been moved forward and to a position of more prominence .
It was darker than the PRT offices had been .   
The aesthetic of the PRT of yesteryear had always been predominantly white , with black stenciled letters and icons , the periodic bit of chrome or mirror when tech was required .   
Here , it was dark stone , lined in gold or brass , and the lighting made me think of a cinema with lights set on high ceilings and tuned to be unobtrusive .   
It was transparent and open in layout and the suggestion of there being very few barriers , like with the glass railings , or the way that it really looked like anyone on the ground floor could go anywhere without checkpoints or security .
“
Where are we going ?
” Sveta asked .
“ I should check on my mom first , see if she ’s free for a short conversation .
”
“
Where is she ?
”
“ Legal or Liaison .   
I ’ve been here twice before , but the first time they were still getting everything put together , and I do n’t remember much from the second .
”
Sveta turned around slowly , then pointed .
“
Good , ” I said .   
“ Thank you .
”
“
Are you on good terms with your parents these days ?
” Sveta asked .
“
I ’m …
” I started .   
“
No .
”
“
Is she going to help ?
” Tristan asked .
“ I do n’t know , ” I said .   
“
It ’s not that kind of bad terms , where she ’d say no , I do n’t think .
”
“
Is it the kind of bad terms where you invite someone to come with you so you do n’t have to worry about the ‘ rents being super embarrassing and lame ?
” Kenzie asked .
“ If I had any idea on what she might say or do then this would be easier , ” I said .   
“
I think it ’ll be fine .
”
The stairs led from either side of the front desk to the second floor , going around the statue - in - relief that mirrored the one on the front of the building .   
The security checkpoint was on the second floor , more or less hidden behind the statue and the slab it stood out from .   
Glass walls separated the walkway from the offices and departments    around the building exterior .
“ Names ?
” the man at the desk asked .
“
Victoria Dallon , Sveta Karelia , Kenzie Martin , Tristan Vera , ” I said .
“ Intentions ?
”
“ We have an appointment with Foresight on the fifth floor .   
I was also hoping to stop in and see my mom at her workplace .   
I ’m not sure if she ’s at Legal or Liaison right now .
”
“
Her name ?
”
“ Carol Dallon .
”
“
One second .
”
The person made a phone call .   
I waited , a little nervous , emotions stirred up .   
Anger , frustration , disappointment , worry .
Kenzie had her chin at the top of the railing , as she looked down at the lobby .   
Sveta stood next to her , with Tristan off to one side .
“
Is Weld getting a statue ?
” Tristan asked .
“ Not for a while , ” Sveta said .   
“
That ’s more for people who ’ve put in the years , and he only just got in .   
He ’s got a preliminary thing in the gift shop .
”
“
No shit ?   
Awesome .   
We should stop in at the gift shop before we leave .
”
“
You ’re such a kid , ” Kenzie said , sticking out her tongue at Tristan .   
He reached out to muss up her hair and she ducked back out of the way .
“ Victoria , was it ?
” the person at the desk asked .
“
Yes , ” I said .
“
Your mother says you can go up .   
She ’s at Legal on the third floor .   
She ’ll take her break when you arrive , so you ’ll have about fifteen minutes .
”
I resisted the urge to wince .   
Fifteen minutes was too much .   
Still , saying that would cause problems .   
“ Great .
”
“ Give me five seconds , and I ’ll give you your guest ID cards .   
Can your friends come to the desk ?
”
We lined up in front of the desk .   
The printer did n’t take long , spitting out four cards in four seconds .
“ Check your names are accurate , please , and-
there seems to be a problem with miss … Kenzie ?
”
He turned the card around .   
A slash of distortion masked Kenzie ’s face , tracing from her cheekbone to one corner of her forehead .   
It looked like the heavy compression artifacting that came with any image that had been compressed too many times , but it was dense to the point that her eyes , nose , and cheekbone were almost completely covered .
“
Do you want to try again ?
” Kenzie asked .   
She had her phone in her hand as she clasped her hands behind her back .   
I saw the screen momentarily light up .
The man tapped at the keyboard for a few seconds , then turned around to grab the card as the machine spat it out .   
He gave a singular nod and passed the card with its attached lanyard to Kenzie .   
Picture normal .
We headed for the stairs up to the third floor .
“ I did n’t know they were going to take our photos , ” Kenzie said .
“
What are you even doing , obscuring your face like that ?
” Tristan asked .
“
It ’s not on purpose , obviously , it ’s a byproduct of tech
I ’m wearing .
”
Once we reached the third floor , there was less in the way of civilian - facing offices , and there were more people in suits and business clothes .   
The glass wall had letters applied to it .   
Just ‘ 303 – LEGAL’ .
My mom had had a study back at our house , with the hundred or so legal tomes with all of the case history , precedent , and whatever else , on top of the books we ’d fashioned ourselves , binding in a variety of ways , saving team stuff , parahuman case files we ’d printed off the net , and more .
This was that , it was the same kind of heavy oak desks that my mom had had in her study , the shelves , the desk lamps and the scattered paperwork that had yet to be gathered together and bound .   
It was files and filing cabinets , a storm of legality as if a giant had sneezed in a legal office .
My mom might have been one of the older people around .   
A lot of the lawyers looked young , and at two in the afternoon , jackets were off and slung on the backs of chairs , sleeves were rolled up and perfect hairstyles were just a little bit messed up .   
She was doing a lot of the talking , taking charge and getting people organized .
A young lady approached us at the doorway .   
“ If you ’re wanting to lay charges against the Wardens , or if you have witness testimony to give , you ’ll want to go to Casework on the second floor .   
I know it ’s confusing .
”
“
My mom is Carol Dallon ,
I ’m just stopping in to ask a question .   
The people at check - in said it was okay .
”
“
Oh wow ,
yeah , look at you .   
I definitely see the resemblance .   
Your mom is awesome , you know .
”
“ I know , ” I said , my eyebrows going up momentarily .
The lady stepped away to fetch my mom .
The feeling of trepidation got worse as I watched my mom walk toward me .   
It was hard to divorce this scene and image with my memory of being on the street outside my mom
’s house , the hurt and the feelings there .
My mom smiled , acknowledging the other three .   
“ Victoria .   
This is a pleasant surprise .
”
“ I    had a conversation with dad last night .   
He suggested that you might be the person to ask for this thing these guys are doing .
”
“
Ah , ” my mom said .   
She barely seemed fazed by that .   
“
Just business ?
”
“
More or less , ” I said .
Man , I was still so pissed at her .   
I was more pissed somehow that she was being nice and casual .
“ I ’m happy to help however you need it , ” she said .   
“
The only issue is I ca n’t step away right this minute .   
We ’re waiting on a phone call from some people in the would - be government , and my coworker is away on a late lunch .
”
“ I do n’t need you to step away , ” I said .   
“ These guys are starting up a team .   
Dad suggested they ’d do best if they had someone legal to call up before any big moves .   
Make sure charges stick .
”
My mom looked over at the three .   
Kenzie put her hand up in a small wave .
“ Is that Sveta ?
”
“
Hi , Mrs. Dallon .
”
“ I did n’t recognize you at first .   
I ca n’t believe it , ” my mom said .   
She approached Sveta , taking Sveta ’s hands and lifting them up .   
“ What beautiful work .
”
“ I ’m pleased with it , ” Sveta said , ducking her head a bit .
“
And the art- is this yours ?   
It reminds me of what I saw you working on during one of my visits .
”
“
It ’s mine .
”
“
It ’s stellar , ” my mom said .
“ I do n’t suppose you ’d know someone you could put us in touch with ?
”
I asked , more tense than I ’d wanted to sound .
“ I can ask around .   
Are you paying them ?
”
“ I think we ’d have to , ” I said .
“ We ’re pretty overloaded right now .   
I ca n’t make promises .
”
“
I do n’t think the team has any major moves planned for early in their career , ” I said .   
“
Having someone available a month from now or two months from now might be good .
”
“ I ’ll see what I can do , but I would n’t be surprised if we ’re still moving at this clip two months from now .
”
“
What do you do ?
” Tristan asked .
“ We ’re lobbying on behalf of the Wardens .   
The government is figuring out the law as we speak , and we ’re trying to figure out the most effective approach to handle law and parahumans and how they interact in the new world .   
A lot of precedent , citing past history , pulling from the law of Earth Bet .
”
“
It sounds heavy , ” Tristan said .
“
We ’re deciding the legal fabric of the new world .   
It is , ” my mom said .
“
Can you sound some people out ?
” I asked .   
“
Having someone we could trust to be discreet would be ideal .   
It would n’t be heavy .
”
“ I ’ll ask around .   
I know we ’ve got a few ex - law students who are in limbo , ” my mom said .   
She gave me a look .   
“
They could use the extra funds , and they should have enough knowledge of the system as it stands .   
They ’re even on the ground floor for the legal system
we may end up with , if we ’re successful here .
”
“
Thank you , ” I said .   
“
We ’ll discuss and I ’ll look at the books , and we ’ll see if we can pay them something fair .
”
Keep it business .
“
Would you come to dinner tonight ?
” she asked .   
“ We can talk .   
If I have a better idea of what you ’re doing , I can find you a better fit .
”
“ I ’d really rather not , ” I said .
“ Communication is key .   
We should talk .
”
“
Another time , ” I said .   
Weeks or months from now .
“
Okay , ” she said .   
“
I ’d like to invite your sister to a sit - down .
”
My dignity and grace were dashed away , just like that .   
A startling , painful jar from reality to somewhere else .   
The lights of the brightly lit legal office seemed too bright and the dark shadows and the dimly lit building interior of the Wardens HQ and its lobby seemed too dark .
It was very , very hard , in the moment , to separate my recollection of being outside the house with her inside that house , from this , and to convince myself that she was n’t here , somewhere nearby .
“
Nah , ”
I said .   
My voice too soft .
“
Victoria-
”
“
Mom , ”
I said , my voice sharp .   
“
Do you want this conversation to go in the same direction as the one at the barbecue ?
”
“
That ’s up to you , ” she said .
I thought about saying something regrettable .
“
Bye mom .   
Good luck with your thing .
”
She looked like she might say something , but she smiled instead , and said , “ Good luck with yours .
”
I turned to go , and the others followed .
We walked a little way around the circumference of the floor , between the offices to our right and the railing to our left , until we were a distance away from the legal department .   
I leaned on the railing , and wrapped one of my hands around the other , squeezing it .
Sveta put an arm around me , and then Kenzie walked up to the other side of me and put a hand on my back .
“
I ’m
okay ,
” I said .
There was n’t an immediate response .
“
She was never my favorite person , ” Sveta said .
“ You seemed to get along with her before .
”
Sveta shook her head , hair flying out a little ways .   
“
You were always really down when she was due to visit , and you were down when she missed visits .   
And you were down after she came .
”
“
I was down all the time .
”
“
It was different kinds .
”
“ Family ’s hard , ” Tristan said .   
“
It really sucks sometimes .
”
“
Yeah , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Family can be the best and it can be the worst .
”
Sveta let her arm slide off my shoulder .   
It settled on Kenzie ’s head with a faint clack .
“
Ow , ” Kenzie said .
Sveta ’s fingers lifted up , then came down , in a pat .
I stood straighter , and Sveta moved a bit away , her arm reeling in , giving me freedom to stand back .   
“
Hopefully this gets you guys one step closer to being a team with everything you need .   
We should go talk to Foresight and see if we can get you the rest of the way .
”
“
What ’re we talking about with Foresight ?
”
“ Jurisdiction , ” I said .   
“
There might be a few other pieces of ground to cover , finances , selling info .
”
“
Sounds good , ” he said .   
“
You up to talking about the kind of info you can gather , Kenz ?
”
“ I think so .
”
The fifth floor was n’t built around a hole in the floor like the bottom four were .   
There was n’t a view of the lobby , a railing , or anything of the sort .   
Another security checkpoint was set up at the base of the stairs .   
With our lanyards and guest IDs , we were clear to go .   
Our arrival was preceded by a shift in lights visible from the stairwell .
Masks on .
The floor plan was closer to a proper office building , with hallways studded with posters and pictures of team members and leaders , teams , and framed news articles .   
The hallway to the right of us had ‘ SHEPHERDS’ and a shepherd ’s crook running down the length of it , a burgundy stripe of paint lit up by lights on the underside of the crook .   
Red - brown colors to the wall , and the articles and pictures were all for the Shepherds .
In the hallway to our left , Foresight , blue and black paint and lights , Foresight members and victories on the wall opposite .
A door opened and a few Shepherds stepped out into the hall .
“
Holy shit , ” one said .
“
Fuck , ” Tristan said , under his breath .
It was the moon girl , from my job interview with Attendant .   
She was the one who had urged me away from the Fallen .   
I was hardly enthused to see her either .
“ Tristan , ” she said .   
“ Tell me you ’re not interviewing for a team .
”
“
I ’m not , ” he said .   
“
I ’ve got the team already .
”
She pursed her lips together .
“ History , Moonsong ?
” someone asked .
“
Yeah , ” Moonsong said .   
“ Tribute knows .
”
“
Yeah , ” the guy who was apparently ‘ Tribute’ said .   
He wore what looked like a hypermodernized version of the suit of armor with the cape over one shoulder .   
It was n’t old fashioned armor , though .   
It was panels on a bodysuit , and the cape was cut to cling close to his body , angular for flowing cloth , with glowing lines where the sharp angles were .   
“ History is putting it lightly .
”
“ We ’re late for an appointment , ” Tristan said .
“
You ’re the guys who are talking to Foresight ,
” someone else said .   
“
They mentioned something like that .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
Then , aware of the opening in the conversation , I elaborated with , “
Hello again , Moonsong .
”
“ Hello , ” she said .   
“
What was your name again ?
”
“ Victoria .
”
“ You seemed cool , Victoria .   
What are you doing with this bastard ?
”
“
Wow , ” Tristan said .
“ Just helping out , ” I said .
“
He does n’t need it , and he does n’t deserve it .
”
“
Whatever ’s in the past , he gets his second chance , like anyone .   
He wants to help people , and I ’m going to help him do that .
”
“
He ’s one of the monsters you help save people from , ” Moonsong said .   
“
You get that
, right ?
”
“
That ’s not fair , ” Kenzie said .
She stopped as Tristan put one hand out in front of her , keeping her from jumping forward in his defense .
“ Tribute and I arrested him , ” Moonsong said .   
“
You know that , right ?
”
I could see the lines in Tristan ’s jaw standing out .   
He said , “ I know .   
I remember .
”
“ I want to see Byron , ” Moonsong said .
“ Not
your call .   
His turn is n’t until later .
”
There was a shudder , and then my hair started to move .     
The light further down the hallway seemed to grow darker , and my stomach lurched in a sensation that I connected to a lot of aerial acrobatics .
“ You want to pick a fight here ?
” Tristan asked .
Tribute shifted his footing , stepping forward a little , and clasped his hands in front of his groin .   
With his head bowed slightly , he was faintly reminiscent of the Wardens’ emblem .
I stepped forward , ready to put myself between them , and I felt the stomach - lurching sensation again .   
My leg buckled , and I nearly fell .
My hair was floating now , and my legs were straining , almost locked in position with the stress of keeping me upright .
Gravity manipulation , but somehow a mix of zero - grav and enhanced gravity .
I flew instead of walking , and it was hard to keep my position .   
I stopped when I was between Tristan and the other two .   
“
This is n’t helpful .
”
“ Victoria , ” Moonsong said .   
“
I ’m going to tell you how this goes .
”
I felt the gravity shift again , an attempt to put me down against the floor , and threw up my forcefield to avoid twisting my ankle or hitting the ground too hard .   
I was glad my skirt was n’t the kind that could flip up , as it hugged my thighs , but my midriff was exposed now .
“
Tristan joins the team , and he charms the pants off of everyone he meets .   
He ’s good at the stuff he does in front of the camera , he ’s good at the hero stuff , he ’s strong .   
He gets decent grades , he makes friends , he finds allies and he works on them .   
Because that ’s what sociopaths do .   
He does n’t actually care about them .
”
“ Sociopath ? ”
Tristan asked .   
“
You ’re as deluded as ever .
”
“
He jokes and acts all cute about how he ’s competitive , he likes to win , and he tends to win so you do n’t really see how sore of a loser he is when things go bad .   
He sets his sights on something he wants , he gets it .   
Sets his sights on something else , he gets it .   
Until he does n’t get what he wants .   
Like being team leader or getting a key role in an event that ’s coming up .   
That ’s when he starts using the people he ’s been working on .   
They ’re usually desperate people .   
Vulnerable ones .
”
I thought of Rain , who Tristan had called a friend .   
Or did the whole team count ?
“
It ’s called leaning on people when you ’re struggling .
”
“
It ’s called manipulation .   
And you ’re good at it , ” Tribute said .
“
Fuck off , ” Tristan said .   
“
Drop the power use and let us go .   
We ’ve got things to do .
”
“ Moonsong , ” Sveta said .   
“
I do n’t think you know Tristan as well as you think .
”
“
Same , ” Moonsong said .   
“
I feel really sorry for you if he ’s already got into your good graces .   
Because that bastard is the kind of guy who hires someone who kills people by looking at them to cover his ass , and uses them against teammates .   
He likes to win and he wins at any cost .
”
“ We know the story , ” Sveta said .
“ I doubt you know the entirety of it .   
Have you split the discussion fifty - fifty between listening to him and Byron ?
”   
Moonsong asked .   
She did n’t even wait for a response before deciding , “ No .   
Because it does n’t work that way .
”
“ I gave Byron the opportunity , ” Tristan said .
“
Yeah , ” Moonsong said .   
“
I know how that goes .   
Like with Team Reach ’s therapist , right ?   
You get your turn , Byron gets his , you go in for extra advice , you take over , and somehow the team ’s therapist gets weird ideas in his head about Byron .   
You suggest things and then when Byron gets his turn
he ’s having to play defense , get rid of these preconceived ideas .   
He gets no time of his own with the therapist , because he ’s stuck trying to undo the damage Tristan did during his time .
”
“
All I did , ” Tristan said , lines standing out as his neck , “ Was try to figure shit out .   
There ’s a lot to figure out with the situation being what it is , and somehow I end up doing the legwork .
”
“
It ’s a lot of work to manipulate everyone around you , is n’t it ?
” Moonsong asked .
“ Stop , ” I said .   
“ Stop this .   
Now .
”
I pushed out with a faint hit of aura .
“ Please , ” Sveta said , adding her voice to mine .
“ I want to hear that Byron is okay , from Byron ’s mouth .   
I do n’t give a shit about Tristan ’s time .
”
“
Fuck this , ” Tristan said .   
“ Fine . ”
He blurred , his eyes becoming crimson points , then transitioning to become teal .
Byron , wearing a sweatshirt and jeans .
The gravity effect dropped away .
“
Hi Byron , ” Kenzie said , her voice small .
“
Hi Kenzie .
”
“
You okay ?
” Moonsong asked .
“ I ’ve had better weeks , but things with my brother are as tolerable as they get , ” Byron said .   
He slouched , sticking his hands in the pocket of the sweatshirt .   
“ You kind of went overboard .
”
“ I had to check .
”
“ I know , ” Byron said .
There was a noise behind us , and I turned to look .
Foresight .   
Anelace and someone I had n’t met .
“
Why do n’t you come on in ?   
Step into the office , ” Anelace asked .   
“ Moonsong ?   
Can I have a word ?
”
Foresight ’s administrative office was n’t the same office I ’d been in when I ’d interviewed with them .   
Their headquarters was situated elsewhere , and this was something else , a space set up for meetings , for paperwork , interactions with other teams and more .   
Much like the hallways had , it looked like an office .
Right away , Moonsong , Tribute , and the member of Foresight stepped into an office , closing the doors .   
The blinds were at an angle where I could see where they stood , but not their expressions or what they might be saying .
Anelace stepped into the back , then came back to the sitting area .   
He looked at us , then at the other members of Moonsong ’s group .   
“ Come on .   
Let ’s keep everyone separate until things are settled .
”
Our group walked into a back room , a single table and some nice chairs in a room with a coffee maker and microwave .
“ I was looking forward to seeing you again , Victoria , ” Anelace said .   
“
Sorry it ’s not under better circumstances .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“
I ’m going to go talk to the others .   
There wo n’t be a problem if I leave you guys here ?
”
“ Not at all , ” I said .
Anelace left us in the room .   
Kenzie flopped forward , forehead hitting the table , arms extended all the way in front of her .
Byron changed back to Tristan .
“
No , ” Tristan said , quiet .   
“
So long as I ’m here , Moonsong is going to be frothing at the mouth .   
I ’m trading out until she ’s good and gone .
”
They swapped back .   
Byron slouched into his seat .
“
I did n’t know that about the therapy , Byron , ” Sveta said .
Byron shrugged .
“
It ’s why you do n’t want to sit in for Mrs. Yamada
’s ?
”
“
It ’s part of it , ” he said .   
“
Look , I do n’t want to demonize Tristan or anything , like Moon is so good at doing .   
He has his good side , but a lot of the time , I ’ve got to conserve my strength for dealing with the rougher patches .   
Minor , basic stuff .
”
“
Do you think he ’s a sociopath ?
” I asked .
“
No , ” Byron said .   
“
But I think … he ’s got to be the worst possible person to end up sharing a body with .
”
“ Is there anything I or we can do to make it easier ?
” I asked .
“
I ’m working on a camera that looks inside Tristan to find Byron , or vice - versa , ” Kenzie said , without raising her head .   
“
It ’s not going so well
but I ’m going to figure it out .
”
“
Thanks Kenz .   
No , nothing makes it easier .   
You can … tackle the broad strokes , you can be careful not to talk past my face to say something to Tristan and never do the opposite when Tristan ’s the one in front .   
It does n’t make a difference with the stuff that really matters .   
That ’s my stuff to deal with .
”
“
What stuff ?
” I asked .
“
He ’s … stubborn , destructively stubborn , he holds this idea of what should happen in his head , and if that does n’t work for you then you ’re probably going to be pretty unhappy , because you are n’t going to change anything about it .
”
“ Reminds me a bit of my mom when you describe it that way , ” I said .
“
Yeah , but you can walk away from your mom , ca n’t you ?
” Byron asked .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
I sighed .
“
I really appreciate that sigh .   
Maybe you get it , ” he said , leaning his head back until it rested against the wall , his face turned skyward .   
“
He thrives on competition , you know .   
He ’ll be a terrific hero , probably .   
Put a challenge in front of him , and he ’ll give his all to kick its ass .
”
“
But ?
” I asked .
“
That ’s him .   
That ’s who he is , intrinsically .   
I do n’t know if there ’s a but .   
It ’s reality , and it ’s reality that I ’m the challenge
and he ’s energized when it comes to the tug of war over this one body we share .   
He thrives on it in a way , and I ’m … drained , beaten down .
”
“ We have your back , ” Sveta said .   
“
Not just Tristan ’s .   
We ’re backing Capricorn , and we ’re invested in finding answers for both of you .
”
“ I appreciate that .   
But I do n’t like this .   
At best , it ’s … more draining .   
More of me being beaten down and left more exhausted .   
At worst …
Moonsong might be right .
”
“
At best , ” I said , “
It ’s Tristan doing what he ’s good at doing .   
What happens if he does n’t have that outlet ?
” I did n’t get a response .
There was a knock on the door .   
Anelace , the dagger - themed member of Foresight .
“
Can you join us ?
” he asked .
We migrated from the team ’s lunch room to the office where the team leader , Moonsong and Tribute were seated .
The leader stood by his desk , one foot on his chair .   
He looked larger of frame , and had Foresight ’s symbol on an eye patch .   
A bit of a corsair look , with a jacket and lots of belts , and long black hair tied back into a sailor ’s ponytail .   
Veins of gold decorated his costume .
“
Sorry for the hassle , ” Tribute said .   
“ History .   
Things never really resolved so much as we all walked away with the situation left halfway through a disaster .
”
“
It ’s alright , ” I said .
“ We ’ve been having a conversation with the Shepherds , ” the leader of Foresight said .   
“
They ’ve explained some of the history .   
It muddies the waters .
”
“ We understand , ” Sveta said .   
“
Sorry about this .
”
“ They had the suggestion that we make sure both of the Capricorn twins are on board with this plan of yours .
”
“ Why ’d you have to drag me into this , Moonsong ?   
This does n’t help .   
I do n’t want to own any part of this , whatever they do .
”
“ I will always fight to give you your voice .
”
“ I do n’t want to speak , ” Byron said .   
“ I want to ignore this side of my reality and conserve my strength for the fights that need it .
”
“ Is that a no , then ?
” the leader of Foresight asked .
“
No , ” Byron said .   
He seemed to flounder for a moment .   
He looked at me .   
“ Fuck .
”
He did n’t break that eye contact with me as he said it .   
My eyebrow went up .
“
Do n’t let me get in the way of you giving these guys their chance , ” Byron said .
“
You ’re vouching for them ?
” the Foresight leader asked .
“
Yeah .
”
Byron punctuated the sentence by changing into Tristan .
“
I ’m good with this , ” Tristan said , shifting his posture to avoid looking at Moonsong .
“
Good , ” the Foresight leader said .   
“ Thank you for your time , Shepherds .
”
Tribute and Moonsong left the office .   
Just Anlace , the leader , Kenzie , Byron , Sveta and I , now .
I looked around the office and saw an article .   
The leader was on the cover , with the name ‘ Brio’ .
“
You really want to do this ?
”
Brio asked .
“
They ’re suited for it , ” I said .   
“
They have the ability to gather the information and figure out how to crack the toughest nuts .   
Tinker devices and people on the ground who wo n’t get a second look hanging around Hollow Point .   
They get the info , they sell it to you guys , and if you want it , they work with you on the actual cracking of the nut .   
Joint operation , or it can be solo , one way or the other .
”
“ Are you participating ?
” he asked .
“
If I ’m wanted , I ’ll add my strength to theirs for the big plays .
”
“ To be honest , there ’s a lot about this that could work , ” Brio said .   
“ When the Wardens gathered us all together , they assigned territories by lottery .   
We ’ve got other things we ’re focusing on , and Hollow Point is in a bad way .
”
“ If you ’ll pay a modest fee , enough to cover their lawyer , buy the info , keep them supplied , they ’ll bring you in for the actual arrests .   
It ’s a win for you guys , while these guys do the leg work .
”
“ If it works , ” Brio said .
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“
We ’re hard workers , ” Kenzie said .   
“
We ’re really good at what we do .
”
“ I do n’t doubt that , ” Brio said .   
His voice had a tone shift that suggested he was used to talking to kids in a certain context .   
“
You have a lot of hurdles .
”
“ We ’ve been doing our initial research , ” Anelace said .   
“ Figuring out how we might fix Hollow Point .   
They ’re tied into some bigger - picture stuff .
”
“ Tattletale , ” I said .
“
Her on one end , ” Anelace said .   
“
But she ’s more the kind of person you have to deal with further down the road .   
Once you scare them , they ’ll call her .   
They already called her once about us , and she reached out to try to convince us to leave the area alone .
”
“
And ?
” I asked .
“
And we ’re leaving it alone , or we were , until you sent your proposal , ”
Brio said .
I nodded .   
Not good to hear , but understandable .   
I wondered what played into that decision .
“
On the front end , you ’ve got some others to deal with .   
You ’ll have to get past them before you can even start on the project .
”
“
Who ?
”
“ Speedrunners , ” Anelace said .   
He turned around , reached for a file , and put it on the desk , pushing it in our direction .
“
I know them , ” I said .   
I left the file for Sveta , Tristan and Kenzie to look at .
“
A couple of times a day , they use their time powers .   
Sweep the area , search every nook and cranny .   
You wo n’t be able to set up shop .
”
“
That ’d be Secondhand , ” I said .
“ They use Final Hour to cover other business .   
Even if you avoid being caught in the sweeps , you wo n’t be able to look or listen in if they ’re conducting meetings in banked timestreams .
”
“
And Last Minute is still with the group ?
” I asked .
“
Yes .
”
Fucking time manipulators .   
“ Something to work out in advance then .
”
“
They ’ve got two thinkers , Braindead and Birdbrain , working as a team .   
You wo n’t be able to have undercover agents if they ’re checking things .   
You will be tracked and your agents will be thoroughly investigated .
”
More folders hit the table .
“
Powers complicate things , and they ’ve got a lot of powers there , ” Anelace said .
“
Bitter Pill , tinker , ” Brio said .   
“
A lot of the people in Hollow Point are expected to partake , and that means truth serums , just to start with .
”
I looked at the other members of the group .
“
You really think you ’re up for this ?
”
Brio asked .
“
Just speaking for myself , I ’m more excited to do this than I was before you started talking about what we ’re up against ,
” Tristan said .
“ I already have some ideas , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Not about the time guys , but I have ideas .
”
“
We knock the time guys down first , ” Tristan said .   
“ Without a question .   
We ’ll have to .   
We can do this .
”
I looked at Sveta , who had been quiet .
“
I want to do this , ” she said , meeting Brio
’s eyes .
“
Then we ’ll give you our files as starting points .   
You guys own this if it ends up being a disaster , you keep us informed , and- ”
“
In exchange , ” I interrupted , “ You guys give us access to your costume sourcing .
”
“ I can do costumes , ” Kenzie said .
“ Without battery lives ?
” I asked .
“
Oh .
”
“ Give us access to your costume manufacturing .
I know you have it
and I know you ’re branching out to share it .
”
Anelace and Brio exchanged a look .   
Brio nodded .   
“ Okay .
”
“
And you give us your blessing to operate in this territory , ” I said .
“ I do n’t know if I like what I saw earlier , ” Brio said .   
“
Blessing might be a strong word .
”
“
All parahumans have their issues , ” I said .
Brio seemed to consider for a moment .
He extended his hand to shake .
We shook it , each of us in turn .
No name yet , costumes to be decided , codenames to be determined .








Ashley took her time exploring Hollow Point .   
Much of her attention was on the stores and the people within them .   
A store with supplies for those living on the fringes and in the tent cities , a used bookstore that was selling books taken from homes in the old world , ten dollars for a cardboard box full , a closed children ’s clothing store .
The people that noticed Ashley were quick to avert their eyes or mind their own business .
She paused at a manicurist ’s , looking within .   
There were rows of comfortable looking chairs with small tables beside them and foot baths below each seat .   
Ads in the window showed a variety of nail art .
Ashley held out her hand in front of her , her black nail polish contrasted with the colorful ‘ Chevalier’ pattern , mimicking the delicate gold flourishes on a silver background .   
She moved her hand to compare to the ‘ Alexandria’ image .
She stepped away and walked a little ways down the street .   
She peered into more closed buildings , passed a bar where the man at the counter pretended not to see her , and then walked by a clothing resale store .   
She paused at a clothing store , and then entered .
She looked through a series of black dresses and skirts , taking some off the rack and draping them over one arm .
“
Ma’am ?
” the store employee asked .   
The young woman looked terrified .   
“
Can I help you with anything ?
”
“ I ’ll let you know .
”
“ Please do .   
I ’ll be at the counter .
”
Ashley continued browsing , picking out an assortment of dresses , until she had eight gathered .   
She approached the change room and paused , looking at the sign that said only three articles of clothing could be brought into the changing area .
She entered the area , but did n’t step into any of the booths .   
Instead , she stood before the mirrors , holding dresses against her front .   
She paused as the front door opened , the bell jingling .   
A male voice asked a question , and the cashier said something in response .
She left six of the dresses where they were , and took two with her as she returned to the woman ’s side of the store .
“ Damsel of Distress , ” the man said .   
He wore a mask with antlers at the corner , forking and extending into the wild locks of hair .   
He ’d used face paint to blend his face into the mask , but the paint mixed multiple colors , with a golden sheen to the paint above his eyes and black on his lower eyelids and lower eye socket .   
He wore a jacket that would n’t have looked out of place in Robin Hood , with a stag ’s head and a singular antler in gold , running from the collarbone , along the collar , and over one shoulder .   
“
What brings you to Cedar Point ?
”
“
Is it Cedar Point or Hollow point ?
”
“
That depends on who you ask .   
Some of the more colorful locals prefer the latter .
”
“ The capes .
”
“
The capes .   
Yes .   
I ’m guessing you ’re here for them more than you ’re here for the shopping .
”
“
I ’m here to see what ’s here , ” she said .   
She turned away from him to pick through some clothes .   
She lifted the sleeve of a dress that was still on the rack , the dress was opaque , but the sleeve was sheer with a lace pattern worked into it .
“
And ?
”
“
And I ’m not impressed so far .
”
“
What did you expect to find that you ’re not seeing ?
”
“ Organization .   
A timely response to my arrival .   
I ’ve been walking around for nearly half an hour
and you ’re the first person to show their face .
”
“
We prefer discretion .
”
“
It feels toothless .   
A sanctuary for villains , and you let people walk in here without stopping them ?
”
“
We ’ve been keeping a close eye on you .
”
“
Eyes are n’t teeth .
”
“
Some are , when you add powers to the mix .   
Shall we take this discussion outside ?
”
Ashley looked at the two dresses in her hand .   
She put one back where it belonged , and then approached the counter .
“
Um , ” the salesgirl said .   
“
You can have it .   
It ’s on the house .
”
“
Is it ?
” Ashley asked .
“ Store policy .   
The owner hopes that you ’ll have a positive view of the store , in case of future trouble .   
Would you like a bag ?
”
Ashley looked at the dress , then shook her head , slinging the dress over one shoulder .   
She looked at the villain with the antlers .   
“ We can talk outside .
”
“ I ’ll be right with you .
”
She walked out of the store , glancing over one shoulder to see him discreetly passing some bills to the salesgirl , who ducked her head in acknowledgement .
The streets were mostly empty , without many cars , parked or otherwise .   
Some of the stores had tunnels or alleys that led to parking lots , but even those did n’t have many vehicles .   
Employee parking , when many stores had only one employee on average .
“
I ’m
Prancer , by the by , ” Prancer said , as he exited the store .
“
The messenger .
”
“
I’m- no .   
Not a messenger , ” he said .   
“
If Cedar Point is anyone ’s , it ’s mine .
”
“
I was there when you first raised the idea of a gathering place .
”
“
Then you know what we ’re doing .
”
“ I walked away halfway through your speech .
”
“ Ah , ” Prancer said .
A car pulled out of the alley , turned a corner , and then drove through the neighborhood , not slowing as it passed the pair .
“
Normally when one villain visits another ’s territory , there ’s a token show of respect .
”
“
Normally , ” Ashley said , “ the person holding the territory does something to earn the respect .   
Normally , when someone brings up respect , they ’re prepared to back up their words .   
Are you going to back up your words and give me some evidence that you deserve even a token show of respect ?
”
Prancer did n’t immediately reply .   
The two stared each other down .
“
You ’re going to be one of the difficult ones , it seems , ” Prancer said .
“ If you ’re relying on convention and expectation then yes , I am .   
If you show me you deserve my time and respect , I ’ll give you it .   
If you think I ’ll give it to you because you run this territory
, you ’ll be sadly disappointed .   
I might even supplant you .
”
“
That ’s a dangerous game , Damsel of Distress .   
Making threats , forcing people to play their hands .   
You do n’t know what cards someone has up their sleeves .
”
“ I have ideas .   
You appeared alone , no bodyguard , no backup .   
You appeared late .   
You ca n’t back up your reputation .
”
“ You might have the wrong ideas about the kind of territory this is .
”
“
Enlighten me , ” Ashley said .   
It almost sounded like a threat .
“
Come .   
Walk with me , ” he said .
They started walking down the sidewalk , in a neighborhood where a third of the businesses were closed .
Prancer did the talking for the first leg of their walk .   
“ Any community of capes will have its rules .   
Standards and things
it does that benefit everyone in it .   
I ’m not a warlord .   
I manage a very diverse group .   
If someone causes a problem , if someone tests us , I can and will give that diverse group direction or adjust the rules .   
I can and will point one of the many , many powers we have at our disposal here at that someone .   
Some are dangerous , some are devious , and some are n’t even parahuman kinds of powers .
”
“ Political . ”
“
Economic .   
Social , ” Prancer said .   
“
I might not be a warlord , I might not even be a warrior , but I have reach .   
A few words from me , and you might find it very hard to find work with a parahuman group .   
You might find that people wo n’t recruit you or do business with you .
”
“
Am I supposed to be concerned ?   
I ’m not looking to join any team , Prancer .   
I ’m not looking to buy or sell petty drugs or prostitutes .   
When I decide to act , I ’ll be leading a team , not joining one , and people will flock to me regardless of what you say .   
They ’ll do business with me because there ’s no other choice .   
I ’m ready to call that bluff of yours .
”
“
And be the first I make an example of ?   
No .   
I ’m something of a schemer , a bit of a politician , and I ’m a very good businessman .   
But if you ’re going to deal with me , you should know that above any and all of that , I ’m a salesman .   
If we ’re talking about bluffs , I know bluffs when I see them , Damsel of Distress .   
I know you came here because you want something .
”
“ I did .   
I finished some shopping
and I have your measure , and I have the measure of your neighborhood .
”
“
Something drew you away from your cozy apartment in an unassuming neighborhood , away from your regular appointments with therapists and the Wardens .   
Your years of history before Gold Morning are a pattern of laying low , being quiet , committing crimes to get food and clothes , and then getting restless and bored .   
That ’s when you traditionally start stirring up trouble .   
Are you restless ?
”
“ You read my files .   
If you ’re expecting that level of access to intimidate me , you ’ll be disappointed .
”
“ I think you ’re bored .   
I know you ’ve been hanging around the Cabin , or the Lodge if you want to call it that .   
I know you like spending time at the tea shop .   
I know that when you get restless you often look for people to spend time with .   
The Jewel of Boston , the Slaughterhouse Nine .   
We know how those stories ended .
”
“
I ’m alive and many of them are dead .
”
“
That ’s not how I would have put it , but alright , ” Prancer said .   
“ If you want something here , you should ask .
”
“ I thought I might want to find a place around here , but if you ’re slow to respond to my arrival , you might be slow to stop heroes from getting in my way .
”
“ You want a place in the community ?
”
“ And security , assurance
I wo n’t be harassed .   
You know about the appointments .   
They ’re why I ’m left free when other ex - members of the Slaughterhouse Nine are still under lock and key .   
They study me then , I let them , and I want to leave it at that , for those days and those times only .   
I do n’t want to be surveilled or scrutinized when I do n’t have to be .
”
“ We have a variety of security measures in place .   
If you chose to move here , if we allowed you to , I think you ’d be satisfied .
”
“
Empty assurances .
”
“
More robust assurances would come only when we knew we could trust you to some degree .   
Obviously , we ’re not about to share particulars with a stranger .   
You could turn around and join a rival group and share that information with them .
”
“
And if I became less of a stranger , it would require an investment of time and trust .   
At that point it would be hard to escape .   
Sunken cost .
”
“
Then it seems we ’re at an impasse .
”
“
So it seems .
”
“
And I can expect you to leave promptly , then .
”
“ I ’ll leave when I ’m ready , ” Ashley said .   
She turned to walk in another direction , heading for another clothing store .
⊙ “ Switch to the overhead camera .   
I want to see what Prancer says and does .
”
“ I ’ll project onto the other wall , ” Kenzie said .   
“ I want to keep the main camera on Ashley .
”
She struck a few keys .   
One face of the projector box behind her desk lit up , projecting onto the wall .   
The image was blurry and badly affected by the light around the room at first , as any projector screen could be , but it swiftly clarified , crystallizing into an image as sharp as any flatscreen television .   
It was an overhead of the street .
The overhead image split , until that screen showed two camera views of Prancer at the same time , one directly overhead , and another that gave something of a view of his face .
The main camera , on the wall in front of and above Kenzie ’s desk , showed Ashley ’s point of view .   
The view bobbed with every step Ashley took , and was periodically obscured when Ashley blinked .
Tristan was bringing things into the room .   
The team ’s temporary accommodation .   
Rain was in the corner , where a table had been set up , laying out parts of mechanical arms while Chris watched .
In the center of the room , Sveta , Natalie the law student
and I watched things on the cameras .
Natalie had her arms folded .   
Her hair was shorter than most boys wore theirs , with a curl at the forehead , her glasses seemed oversized for her face , and her forehead was wrinkled in worry or concentration .   
She dressed in clothes that made me think she ’d picked clothes out of a magazine without reading the rationale behind those clothes .   
She wore a blouse that fit her body closely , made of a faintly reflective material , with a black ribbon tied where it drew the collar together .   
She wore a straight - cut skirt that started at the waist and ended at the knee , and dark hose , with tidy , heel - less business shoes .   
It was the kind of thing that made a model in a magazine look stunning , but Natalie was five - foot two , she did n’t really have a waist , and the outfit made both of those things very obvious .
“
What do you think ?
” I asked .
“ I think it would be very hard to explain to a judge why your agent took the free clothes from the store , ” Natalie said .   
“
I think you could explain it , but it feels like an implicit protection racket and
that ’s something that would be thrown in your faces .
”
“ Hey Tristan .   
Can I grab one of those whiteboards ?
” I asked .
“
Sure .
”
The whiteboard did n’t have the legs or rollers attached yet , so Sveta held it upright for me .   
I wrote down the bit about taking the dress ‘ on the house’ .
“ I do n’t like the threatening tone , either .   
Entrapment has a pretty high bar , but if your agent threatens the targets , implicitly or explicitly , to insinuate herself into that environment , it casts a lot of it into jeopardy .   
They ’ll turn around and say they had to do these things because a woman in black who can kill people by pointing at them was telling them to .
”
I wrote it down .   
“
We ’ll tell her to tone it down .   
How long until we can communicate with her , Kenzie ?
”
Kenzie spun around in her computer chair , pulling her legs close to her chest to keep them out of the way of the desk
’s edge .   
She stuck out a foot , kicking one of the boxes to the right of the desk .   
A bar appeared diagonally across it .   
“ Sixty percent .   
Ummmm .   
Fifteen minutes until we can be totally sure they ’re not tapped into cell towers or internet .
”
“ I actually have a lot of concerns about her as an undercover agent .
”
“
She ’s not an undercover agent , ” Tristan said .   
“
She ’s just there .   
Keeping an eye on things , keeping an ear out .
”
“
That ’s an undercover agent , ” Natalie said .
“
She is n’t joining any team or participating in anything , ” Tristan said .
“
No espionage , no immediate risk , ” Chris added his voice .
“ I have concerns , ” Natalie said .   
“
I ’ll just say that .
”
Ashley was investigating a bookstore now , on the main screen .   
Our testing of the waters .
On the other screen , Prancer was meeting a trio of others .
Kenzie glanced at it and hit a key .   
Windows popped up , with three - dimensional models of each face , mask included .   
A young woman with a purple hood with nascent antlers sticking up through it , a skinny woman with rusty nails instead of teeth , and a woman in a white jacket with a doctor ’s face mask .
I named them .   
“ Velvet and Nailbiter .   
That might be Bitter Pill , but she has n’t shown her face or been photographed any for the files .   
Is there sound ?
”
Kenzie hit a key on her keyboard .   
“
It ’s going to kill the flying camera ’s battery .   
We get a minute or two
and then I need to bring it home .   
Or we get three minutes
and I bring it halfway home , and someone has to go over to pick it up wherever I land it .
”
“
Alright .
”
“ … up to ?
”
Velvet asked , her voice playing from a speaker .
“ Looking around .   
She was thinking of moving in , but she did n’t like how long it took us to turn up , ” Prancer said .
“
She ’s aware we were watching her , is n’t she ?
”
“
No .   
And she does n’t give a shit , either .   
I outright told her and she was more concerned about the fact we had n’t shown ourselves sooner .   
She ’ll be a problem if she sticks around .
”
“
What kind of problem ?
”
Tristan , Rain , and Chris had stopped what they were doing and drew close , to listen and watch .
“
She was quick to talk about supplanting the local leadership .   
We operate with a soft hand and she seems like the sort that respects only firm ones .   
There ’s more to it , ties into something we ’ve heard from … key voices .   
I ’d rather have that conversation somewhere more private than this .
”
“
Do you want me to deal with her ?
”
Nailbiter asked , her words whistling through her teeth .
“
No , ” Prancer said .
“ Why am I here then ?
”
“
Because I think you and her are similar .   
You respect strength , you know how power works .   
You ’ve dealt with scary customers .   
If we end up interacting with her more , and especially if she moves into the neighborhood , I think we want you to be on point , interacting with her more .
”
“ I can do that .   
She was Slaughterhouse ?
”
“
Briefly , and you were Birdcage .   
I think a lot of the same principles apply .
”
Nailbiter chuckled , a wheezy , whistling sound .   
“
I never thought of that .   
Probably .
”
“ If this visitor of ours winds up being a problem , I do n’t want you stepping into the fray against her .
”
“ Why not ?
”
Nailbiter asked .
“
Because I do n’t know how it would turn out .   
I ’d rather make moves where I know the result in advance .
”
“
Whatever , ” Nailbiter said .
Velvet made a sound , then drew closer to Prancer , putting her arm around him .   
He put his arm around her .   
“
Not whatever .   
I like that kind of thinking .
”
“
Thank you , ” Prancer said .
“
I ’m curious what that thing is that you do n’t want to talk about in the open , ” Velvet said .   
“
Can we go inside ?
”
“ We can .   
You ’re free to carry on with your day , Nailbiter .   
Thanks for coming .   
Pill , I want to ask you about some import - export work .   
Can you come ?
”
There was no sound from Bitter Pill , only a nod that the camera caught .
The group split up , Nailbiter walked away .   
The trio headed into an alleyway .   
The airborne camera moved , trying to get a view of the alley interior , and only saw a door close .
The image changed , as Kenzie typed .   
It showed an overhead map of the area .   
Kenzie marked the building they ’d entered with a red highlight and a little flag icon , then began typing out a note .
“
Can you get sound of building interiors ?
” I asked .
“
Kind of not really , ” Kenzie said .
“
That ’s real clear , ” Chris said .
“ I ’ve got one camera with good aerial camouflage that I really do n’t want to get damaged because it took a whole weekend and a lot of stuff to put it together .   
I have two more that do n’t have special camouflage , they ’re just painted to match the sky , and I can only use them if the sky is the right color , or if I do n’t mind them being spotted .   
They could get destroyed and I would n’t mind them breaking that much .   
It would take me something like two days to get more advanced sound built into any of them , and
then I ’m putting a lot of eggs in one basket
or I ’m making a disposable camera not so disposable .
”
“
But you can do it ?
” I asked .
“
I ’m better with visuals , but yeah , I can do it .
”
“ Even if we decided it was worth building , it would take a while before you had that kind of microphone online , ” Rain said .
“
It ’s a sound camera , not a microphone , ” Kenzie said .   
“
But
yeah .   
And I ’m trying to figure out the teleporters and the longer ranged cameras
and I ’ve got to fix up some old stuff
so it ’s ready if we need it , and that ’s all stuff
I really should do , and
if I ’m doing that I ’m not doing any of the fun stuff .
”
Ashley , on her screen , paused to write something down .
LEAVING SOON She used a small burst of her power to destroy the paper shortly after writing it down .
Kenzie snapshotted the note , then typed it up , adding it to a log in the sidebar , where it joined two other brief notes that Ashley had written on her way into Cedar Point .
“
One thing I ’ll say about Ashley ?
” Tristan said .   
“
She ’s provocative .   
From what I saw of that conversation , she impugned Prancer ’s leadership right off , forced him to prove himself , gave us a sense of the power structure .   
She almost had him talking about anti - surveillance measures , but he ’s being smart about keeping that mostly under wraps .
”
“
He probably has some we have n’t heard or talked about , ” I said .
“
She did n’t make any friends while she was doing all of that , ” Rain said .
“ We do n’t need her to make friends , ” Tristan said .   
“
She ’s not going undercover .   
Not explicitly .   
She ’s just … there .   
Keeping an eye on things .
”
I said , “ My instinct is that if she keeps pushing on the level she was , people will get antsy or suspicious .   
It might be good to have her hang back , wait a bit before making contact or visiting again .
”
“ I could swing through , ” Chris said .
“
We should wait until we ’re more settled , ” Tristan said .
“
There are actually a few obstacles to figure out , ” I said .
“
Sorry to take over the one whiteboard here .
”
“ We got a lot of the whiteboards because we thought we ’d have one for each member of the team , and one for you , Victoria , ” Rain said .   
“ Two for Kenzie and two for me because we ’re tinkers and you can never give tinkers too many surfaces to write stuff down on .
”
“ Yus , ” Kenzie said .   
Her legs were kicking a mile a minute as she focused on her computers , a box to her right and the projector box on the far side of her desk , the camera images playing on the wall .   
One of the split - screen images showing the overhead of the building Prancer had entered turned red , blacked out , and then disappeared , shrinking down to leave the other image , which was tracking Nailbiter .
“
Can you project the faces you had onto one of the whiteboards ?
” Sveta asked .
Kenzie brought up images , then moved the projected image until it overlapped one side of the whiteboard .   
She had to look over one shoulder as she moved the mouse to make sure the image was in place .
Sveta dropped her hand , and used a tendril - wrapped marker to slowly trace out major facial features , hair , and the outlines of the masks for Prancer .
I looked at Natalie .
Natalie ’s forehead , perpetually wrinkled , wrinkled further as she raised her eyebrows , looking from whiteboard to whiteboard , screen to screen .   
“ I recommend moving slowly at first .   
I ’ll give you some general , not - a - lawyer advice on things for free .   
It ’s interesting and
it ’s relevant to what I want to do in the long run .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .   
“
That ’s great .   
I ’m not sure how slow the initial moves are going to be , though .   
The team needs to get some things out of the way before they have more freedom .
”
Sveta turned her head .   
“
The stuff
Foresight said ?
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
We ’re situated on the very outskirts of Cedar Point , here , and you ca n’t move into the area until a few hurdles are crossed .   
You ca n’t really have Ashley or Chris spend any extended time in the area until the Speedrunners , Birdbrain and Braindead are dealt with , and we ca n’t move this headquarters into enemy territory if they ’re going to find it and trash the place .   
In an ideal world , you ’ll want to do something about Tattletale ’s involvement too .
”
“ I ’ve been thinking of Tattletale as an inevitable thing we ’ll have to deal with , ” Rain said .
“
There are things you can do , ” I said .   
“
We can discuss those things when Natalie is gone .
”
“ Actually , ” Natalie said .   
“ I should probably go .   
I have a class tomorrow morning and then work at the Wardens’ building tomorrow afternoon .
”
A class .   
I felt a tiny bit of resentment over the fact that she had that .
“
Alright .   
Thank you for coming and saying hi , ” I said .
“
It ’s interesting ,
” she said , forehead wrinkling in that worried way .   
“
I really recommend you be careful .
”
“ As careful as is possible , ” Sveta said .
Natalie nodded .   
“
It was nice to meet you all .   
You have my number if you need it .
”
There was a chorus of farewells .   
I walked Natalie to the side door of the building , where the fire escape was .   
The way down was steep , and she kept one hand on her little messenger bag and the other on the railing as she made her way down , bringing one foot down to a step , then bringing the other foot down to the same step .
Her entire demeanor made me feel faintly anxious .   
I did n’t have a great read on her yet , she ’d spent ten minutes at the temporary headquarters here , and most of it had been spent observing .
It was something of a relief to have her available if we needed her , and it was a different kind of relief to have her gone .   
The others , too , seemed to relax a bit .
“ Natalie seemed nice enough , ” Sveta said .
“
She did , ” I said .
I took a moment to get Natalie ’s number off my phone and put it on one corner of the whiteboard I ’d been using , the whiteboard leaning against the wall .   
I then wrote down Gilpatrick ’s , with a note beneath it .   
For emergencies only .
The Patrol was a resource , Gilpatrick was one too .   
I did n’t want to overuse that card , though .   
Gilpatrick had already been too kind with being a reference for me while I hunted for work .
With those numbers in the top corner , joined by my own , I wrote down ‘ Hurdles’ .
We ’d already covered the basics of the major players on the scene .   
Speedrunners , Birdbrain , Braindead , Bitter Pill .   
There were others that we ’d learn about , I was sure .   
Prancer was the closest thing we had to a kingpin that needed toppling .
In a hypothetical world where everything went perfectly , I would n’t have minded getting Tattletale as a part of things .   
I was n’t sure my hopes were that high .
I put them down as the people the group needed to knock down before they could fully set up .
I wrote down ‘ Team :
Needs name & brand.’
“ Ooh , ” Kenzie said .
She was watching me write stuff down , her attention no longer on her computers .
“
Here , ” Tristan said , approaching my whiteboard .   
He held it up , and then created the orange sparks .   
They solidified , becoming the legs that raised the whiteboard up to a convenient level .
“
There ’s no rush to name ourselves , ” Sveta said .
“
No rush , ”
I said .   
“
But it needs doing .   
It ’ll be easier to interact with other heroes once you have something .   
Are you taking a cape name ?
”
“ Probably , ” she said .   
“
I ’m not
sure I want to go the doll route .   
A little too similar to Mannequin .   
A lot of the reaching , grabbing names are already taken .
”
“
Brainstorm , think about it , see what feels comfortable , ” I said .   
“ Kenzie and Tristan , you guys too .   
You probably ca n’t use your old cape names .
”
“
I was Optics , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I ca n’t use my old name , I do n’t think .   
PRT owned it .
”
“
Exactly , ” I said .
“ I think I can use Capricorn , ” Tristan said .   
“ When we reached out to the first Capricorn for permission , they signed over the rights to Byron and me , not to Reach .
”
“
You ’re sure ?
” I asked .
“ Ninety - nine percent sure .
”
“
That simplifies things , ” I said .
“ Observer , Pupil , Scrutinizer , ” Kenzie said .
“
Those are terrible , ” Chris said .
“
Um .   
Watcher .   
Eyewitness , Gape ?
”
“
Oh yeah ,
” Chris said .   
“ Gape .   
That does n’t have connotations at all .
”
“
Beholder ?
”
Kenzie asked , her eye on her computer screen .   
“ Spectator .   
Specs .   
Voyeur ?
”
“ Voyeur .   
Perfect , ” Chris said , filling his voice with sarcasm .   
“
Little Kenzie watching through the window while you change .   
We could make that a thing .
”
“
What kind of thing ?
”
Rain asked .
“
You could be Groper , ” Chris said .   
“
Sveta could be Hentai or Tentacle Love or something .
”
“ Ew , ” Sveta said .   
“ And lame to go there .
”
Chris smiled , seemingly not bothered that he ’d bothered Sveta .   
“
I could be …
”
“
Short and curly ?
”
Rain asked .
There were a few chuckles .
“ And Victoria , she needs a name and she ’s sort of a member of the team , ” Chris said .
“
I ’m
shocked , just shocked , at how Chris finally starts participating more when the rude stuff comes up , ” Sveta said .
“
I ’m not ,
” Kenzie said .   
“
That seems like it ’s one hundred percent Chris .
” I smiled .   
Chris had given me an in , and if I was going to get along with these guys , I needed to put something out there .   
“ If you want to give me a vaguely rude name , tie it to my attention - grabbing aura , me being hard to crack when my defenses are up ?
”
“ You have an idea ?
” Chris asked .
“ Pearl , ” I said .
“
That ’s … really subtle , ” he said .   
“ Kind of wimpy .
” I shrugged .
“ I do n’t get it , ” Kenzie said .
“
I like it because Kenzie does n’t get it ,
so I do n’t feel weird saying it around her , ” I said .
“
That ’s a good line of thinking , ” Sveta said .   
“ I approve .
”
She ’d stuck out her fist , and I stuck out mine to meet it .   
“ Thank you .
”
“
I actually agree with Chris , ” Kenzie said .   
She ’d turned around and was looking something up online .   
“
Pearl is pretty lame as innuendo goes .
”
“
But it works , ” I said .   
“
It fits .   
That has to count for something .
”
There was a throat - clearing noise , interrupting the back - and - forth .   
All heads turned toward Tristan .
“
I think I have all of you beat , ” Tristan said .
“ Of course you do , ” Rain said .
“ Even if you did n’t have us beat , you ’d say you had us beat , ” Chris said .   
“
And then you ’d ruin the joke by insisting you win even when yours is lame .
”
“
I ’m
one hundred percent positive I win , ” Tristan said .   
“ I have the best rude name .   
Guarantee you .
”
“
One hundred percent is pretty confident , ” Sveta said .
“
I ’m one hundred and ten percent confident , even , ” Tristan said .
“ Out with it , then , ” Chris said .
Tristan straightened , fixed his armor at the front , and cleared his throat , drawing it out .
“
You ’re setting us up for disappointment , ” Rain said .
Tristan cleared his throat again , exaggerated , until everyone from Sveta to Chris was rolling their eyes .
“
Wet and Horny Teens , ” Tristan said .
It said something that nobody wanted to give him a laugh at that .   
It was Chris who cracked first , falling out of his seat before the impact let the initial guffaw loose .   
I chuckled , half at Tristan , and half at how much Chris seemed to be enjoying this .
“
That ’s atrocious , ” Sveta said , but she was smiling .
“ Tristan is pretty atrocious , so it makes a lot of sense coming from him , ” Rain said .   
“
It says a lot that that ’s his idea of subtle .
”
“
It ’s subtle like a brick through a window , ” Sveta said .
“ Come on , ” Tristan said .   
“
You guys give me so much shit , you do n’t give me any credit .   
I deserve a win for this one .   
It ’s great .
”
Chris was on the floor still , pounding one fist on the floorboards while holding in his laughs .
I looked over at Kenzie , who had her back to the group , her face in her hands as she held in her laughs .
Immature , stupid , but so valuable to have the little bonding moment .   
I had a smile on my face as I returned to the whiteboard .
My eye returned to the people the group needed to take down , the ones who were in the way , or who were set up in such a way as to make the covert information gathering fail from the get - go .
I wrote down ‘ Rain ’s situation’ .
He needed protection .   
I added the three members of his cluster , and then drew an arrow , looping back to Tattletale .
The smile dropped away from my face as I stared at her name .   
It kept going back to her .   
She was a massive obstacle .
Sveta came to stand next to me , looking at my whiteboard .   
“
Distract me from these perverts .
”
I stuck out my marker , putting a dot beside Tattletale ’s name .
“ You ’ve got a bit of a grudge , ” Sveta said .
“ I ’ve got a lot of a grudge , ” I said .   
“
A lot of things would be simpler if we could do something about her .   
I ’m thinking …
”
“ You have an idea ?
” Sveta asked .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
I turned around .   
“
I have an idea .   
I do n’t suppose you have any contacts or favors you can pull in ?   
With capes , specifically ?
”
“ Maybe , ” Sveta said .   
“ Weld , and Weld
’s friends .   
I ’m kind of reluctant to go there though .
” I nodded .   
It made sense that she was reluctant .   
Sveta wanted to stand on her own .   
Going that route would be the opposite of what she wanted .
“
What ’s this ?
”
Rain asked .
“ Friends , contacts , ” Sveta said .   
“ Capes we could reach out to .   
Victoria has an idea .
”
“ I do , ” Kenzie said , perking up some as she caught wind of our conversation .   
“
Or I might .   
I can try .   
What ’s this for ?
”
“
Making a first move , in a way that wo n’t give the lawyer headaches , ” I said .   
“
It ’s not going to make us any friends though .
”
“ Seems to be an emerging pattern , that , ” Rain said .








“ Classify the following angles as obtuse , acute , or right , ” Kenzie said .   
She sighed .
“
You know this ?
”
I asked .
She looked up from her homework and rolled her eyes .   
“
Yes , I know this .   
I did n’t have the words to describe what I knew before taking the class
but I get this .
”
“ Make it interesting , ” I said .   
“
Challenge yourself , try to answer as fast as you can , and try to get past where you ’re having to think about it and get to where the knowledge is automatic .
”
“
Acute , acute , obtuse , right , acute , obtuse , acute , right , right , ” she said .   
“
I ’m really tempted to sit down and make up my own questions to leave on the worksheet for the teacher , except I ’d have to look things up to make sure some mathematician did n’t already give it a name .   
What ’s it called when it ’s a full circle ?   
Three hundred and sixty degrees of angle ?
” I frowned .   
“
You ’re asking me to think back about seven years right now .   
Complete , I think ?
”
“ Full , complete , or perigon , ” Chris said .
All heads craned around to look at him .   
He was sitting in a corner , a table to his left , with so many things piled up that the bag , costume , snacks and notebooks loomed well over the top of his head .   
He sat on a chair with his feet up on the seat , a comic and phone on his lap .   
He had his headphones on , but only one was covering an ear .
He realized people were looking and frowned .   
“
What ? ”
“
You actually have a brain ?
” Tristan asked .
“ I studied it a few weeks ago , ” Chris said , shrugging , turning his attention back to his comic .
“
I ’m
pretty sure I do n’t remember studying that
when I was your age , ” Tristan said .
“ I self - study .   
There are n’t enough seats in schools so they gave us the option of doing these workbooks and handing them in .   
I ’ve lost track of how far ahead I got , ” Chris said .   
“
It ’s why I do n’t have homework .   
My regular schoolwork is the homework
and I get that done earlier in the day .
”
“ Perigon , ” Kenzie said to herself , hunched over her worksheet and books , a pen in hand .   
“
That one sounds best .   
Let ’s call this one a … hyper - perigon angle .
”
“
More complete an angle than a circle ?
” I asked .
“
Yeah , ” she said .   
“ If you want to get into multidimensional space then you have to get there somehow .   
So you make a circle that ’s more closed than a regular circle and that gives you an
in , right ?   
It can be theoretical if you want but obviously this is one of a hundred ways I can start pushing the boundaries .
”
“ Uh huh .
”
She drew on the paper with her pen , drawing out a perfect circle and then scribbling out extra lines and numbers .
“ You ’re aware you ca n’t hand that in now
, right ?
” I said .
“
It ’s fine , it ’s fine , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Once you ’re there you can start thinking about lenses positioned to use the excess space you ’ve given yourself and play that out .   
I heard somewhere that images that hit the back of your eye get flipped upside - down , and the brain turns it back upright .   
So we write something down that lets us toy with that concept
…
”
Her pen moved as she wrote out a mathematical formula .
“ …
And from there we get the reflected extra space on the other side of the lens constant .   
In brief , we start talking about hyper - hyper - perigon angles .
”
“
Hyper is right , ” Chris muttered .
“
Shh , leave her alone , ” Sveta said .
Kenzie looked up at me , “ This is where I have to leave you behind , Victoria , because I get stuff that ’s hyper - hyper
but I ca n’t help you get it .
”
“
Frankly , you left me behind a minute ago , ” I said .   
“
What are the hearts , stars , and apples you ’re writing down ?
”
“
It ’s algebra , duh .   
You do n’t have to use X and Y or A and
B.   
You can use anything to represent the variable .   
I like hearts and stars and apples .
”
“
I feel like if you autopsied Kenzie , she ’d have a bowl of breakfast cereal instead of gray matter .
” Kenzie spun around , sticking out a hand to grab the desk so she did n’t keep spinning .   
She stared at Chris , “ I feel like if we autopsied you , Chris , we ’d find you have one of those tumors with teeth , eyes and hair in it instead of a brain .
”
“
There ’s a good chance you actually would , ” Chris said .   
“
That ’d be cool .
”
“
Yes it would , ” Kenzie said , very seriously .   
She spun herself around , grabbing the desk , now facing her defaced homework .
Sveta walked over from the whiteboard , where she ’d finished tracing the faces that had once been projected onto it .   
An artist ’s sketch of the    players we ’d seen and been involved with .   
Another part of the whiteboard had some name ideas .
“
You ca n’t hand that in , ” Sveta said .
“ I said that already , ” I said .
Kenzie looked up at me .   
“
People often ask how the tinkering stuff works .   
It ’s real easy .   
All it takes is closing a circle extra closed and having the right lens to use the wrinkles and bulges that result .
”
“ Easy , ” I said , smiling a little .
She continued drawing out math and lines .   
She had a steady hand when it came to drawing out the geometry .   
I idly wondered if her tinker power played into that .   
She began drawing out a gun , similar to her flash pistol .
The drawing of a woman ’s face was comparatively , almost ludicrously crude compared to the gun she ’d drawn out .   
Kenzie scribbled out the eyes , then wrote out ‘ I gave boring angle homework and now I ’m blind foreverrrr’ .
She wrote out a few more ‘ r ’s and then paused , scribbling out ‘ boring’ and writing ‘ obtuse’ above the scribble .
“ Kenzie , ” Sveta said , with a truly impressive amount of disappointment in the one word .
Kenzie turned her head slightly , looking up at Sveta with one eye that twinkled with mischief .   
She looked back at her work , writing down an extra ‘ oh no’ by the teacher ’s head .
I cocked my head , listening as Kenzie worked with renewed energy .
“
You ’re getting carried away , ” Sveta said .
I looked at the boxes near Kenzie , saw the projector box    to Kenzie ’s right had a face lit up .   
It was pointed at the whiteboard Sveta had been working on , but no longer projected the camera images of the faces .
Reaching down , I plucked the pen from Kenzie ’s hand .
She did n’t protest or stop me , only leaning back as I picked up the paper .
I walked a few paces away , holding up the sheet , glanced back at the projector box , and then walked another two paces .
The projected image of the scribblings , tinker notes and doodles disappeared .   
I turned it around to show Sveta .
She took the sheet , then experimented with moving it inside and beyond the boundaries of the projector box .   
Kenzie perched on the edge of her seat , watching , her tongue sticking out between her teeth , where she lightly bit it .
“
Well played , ” I said .
“
I said it was fine , ” she said .
“ You did .
”
“
She filled in some of the right answers with real pen marks while scribbling , ” Sveta observed .   
She turned the sheet around , moving it through the air .
The scratched out word with ‘ obtuse’ over it had been cover for putting ‘ obtuse’ into one of the blanks .
“ Very well played , ” I said .
Sveta handed the sheet back .   
Kenzie put it down and moved her hand .   
The projector moved the image of the scribblings on her whiteboard , leaving the sheet normal .   
She flipped it over and sighed , head lolling back .   
Without looking at the sheet , she said , “ Acute , right , obtuse , acute , acute , obtuse .
”
Sveta approached , putting a hand on Kenzie ’s head .   
“ How about instead of doing the math homework you could do in your sleep , you take advantage of having us here to help you with stuff
you are n’t as strong with ?   
What do you struggle with ?
”
“ I get As in everything and A pluses in some stuff .   
But I work on English for the longest
and I ’m a little less good at gym .   
Mostly when I get bad marks
it ’s because I lost marks because my teachers are fed up with me .
”
“ Fed up ?
” I asked .
“ Mrs. Beyer docked my grade because I wanted to stay inside at recess to talk with her about a project
and she said I could n’t
and she needed a break from me .   
She said no ifs ands or buts
and I said
but , so she penalized my grade .   
Then when I tried to argue she took off a mark for every word I said .   
Five marks for five words , and one for the but- do n’t even say it , Chris .
”
Chris was talking with Tristan and Rain .   
“
You ’re so self - important
you think I ’m listening to you ?
”
Kenzie smiled , rolling her eyes a bit .
“ English , then ?
” Sveta asked .
“ It takes me the longest , ” Kenzie said .
Sveta looked at me .   
“
How were you in English ?
”
“ B minus or thereabouts , ” I said .   
“ I did better with the courses I took at the hospital than I did in high school .
”
“ How come ?
”
“
I write good papers and I ’m good with themes and symbolism , but the classes I took in high school spent so long on each thing I felt like my brain was turning inside out with boredom .   
I ’d start resenting the books and I sabotaged myself by not doing the related work or reading it myself .   
Do n’t do that , Kenzie .
”
“ I do well in English , even with the parts we sit on forever , ” Sveta said .   
“
I ’ll take point in helping Kenzie , you help ?
”
“
Sure , ” I said .
My role ended up being even more backseat than that .   
Sveta had read the book , and I had n’t .   
I stood back , watching , glanced back at the others , where the three boys were talking video games , which they had been doing since before Kenzie had started on her homework , and I rolled my eyes .
Rain stepped away from the conversation .   
Grabbing a marker from the packet , he wrote ‘ Rain’ at the top corner of his whiteboard .
Below that , he wrote , ‘ names’ , followed by ‘ Bracer’ , ‘ Clasp’ , and ‘ Pinch’ .
I approached , looking .
“
No homework ?
” I asked .
“ I like to do it late .   
My family mostly leaves me alone while I ’m doing it , and I get to tire out my brain and distract myself from what sleeping actually involves .   
I can go straight from that to bed .
” I nodded .   
“
Sounds like you have a system then .   
If you ever need help with studying , I ’m happy to help .
”
“
I ’m a pretty crummy student , but I get by .   
I think I ’ll be okay .
”
“
You ’re sure ?
”
“
Yeah .   
I ca n’t see myself doing anything that leans too heavily on the school thing anyway .
”
“ You ’d be surprised at how it comes into play , ” I said .
“ Maybe .   
But …   
I dunno if I see myself being alive and well a few years from now .   
That might be some of it .
”
“ Because of your cluster ?
”
“
Because capes do n’t tend to live that long .   
Because things were going south well before Gold Morning and it does n’t feel like anything ’s over or stopped .   
Every day , I think about the fact that there are still Endbringers out there .   
Broken triggers .   
Dangerous people with too much power .
”
“ There ’s heroes .   
People stopping those things .   
Maybe you ’ll be one of them .   
People die-
it sucks but not all of them die .   
Not all of us .
”
“ I guess , ” he said .   
“
It might sound like I ’m trying to ask for a pep talk , but I ’m really not .   
Right now
, I ’m focused on things I got ta do .   
Like a name .
”
That was my signal to back off .   
Fine .
“ Clasp is a fairly decent name .   
Could work with the right costume .   
I ’m not sure it feels right with the blaster power .
”
“ I was thinking of seizing something , as a prelude to something , or unclasping as … it sounded better in my head .   
Do n’t laugh at my terrible names or reasoning , please , ” he said .   
“ Making a name that captures all of your powers when you have four is a pain in the ass .   
I ’m just brainstorming .
”
“
I ’m not going to make fun , ” I said .   
“
I have no idea
what I ’m going to call myself when I get back to the costumed heroics .
”
“
Yeah , ” he said .    
“ I was trying to think of names that might sound like they refer to the hands and the set - up , knock - down part of the power .   
Kind of .   
I do n’t know .
”
“ Bracer ’s taken , by the way , ” I said .   
“
I ’m not sure of the others .
”
He reached down to the pile of stuff at the foot of his board and picked up one of his tinker arms .   
It was just a bit thinner than his regular arm , just a bit shorter .   
Kenzie ’s picture of a gun had looked more ‘ tinker’ than this .   
It was wires with sheet metal bent into a crude , hand - like shape around it .   
He brought the textured plastic pad up to his shoulder and bound the straps around his shoulder , armpit , and upper arm before tapping it twice .   
He winced , showing his teeth momentarily .
“ Hurts ?
” I asked .
“ Nervous connection , and a bit of excess energy with the switch - on .   
I could fine tune it so it does n’t shock me , but I might break something in the process .   
Ashley ’s hands are made by someone who does n’t even focus on prosthetics and they ’re better than what I make .
”
“ You might be better than you think .
”
“ Mrs. Yamada thinks I have self esteem problems , but I do suck , so it ’s more like I ’m too aware of my reality .   
My blaster power is okay , because it ’s mine , but it ’s kind of all or nothing , leaning just a bit toward nothing , especially if I ’m avoiding trying to kill , which I am .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .   
I thought of him jumping off the train .   
I wondered how honest he was about it .   
“
The mover power , it lets you …
”
“ Stop . ”
He stepped back , then jogged a few steps , stopping mid - run , as if he ’d frozen in time .   
He had n’t , though .   
While suspended at an angle someone else would have tipped over , he twisted around and put a foot out to one side .   
He moved in another direction , back to his board .
“
Any limitations ?   
If I used my full strength and threw you , would you only slow down ?
”
“
No .   
I ’d stop .   
If I timed it right , I could fall from a plane , hit terminal velocity and then stop myself just before hitting the ground .   
It’s- it ’d be useful then , it ’s useful if I want to not fall over or if I want to maneuver a bit .   
But it ’s not that amazing as powers go .
”
He was n’t lying , then .   
Not about that .   
There were uses , but it did sound somewhat limited for even a secondary power .
He seemed to read something in my expression , because he had further protests , “ It ’s really not that amazing .   
I have to wait between each use of it , and it ’s not something I can build a name or identity around .   
The emotion power has no impact or visual side to it , so it ’s out too .
”
“
A few of the multi - triggers I ’m aware of tend to have more
…
I ’m not sure what the word is .   
Esoteric or abstract names .   
The one villain in my town was Circus .   
The solution to a disparate set of powers is to just create something more out there that has its own identity , and then fit your powers to match , instead of trying to fit your identity to a random set of powers .
”
“
Identity like what ?
”
“
Like … if you ’re standing back and using your blaster power , maybe something like a warlock aesthetic .   
You could have a robe , multiple arms , you ’ve got your ‘ magic’ , both with the blaster power and the emotion one .
”
“
No , ” he said , quieter than before .   
He stared at the board .   
“ Not like that .
That ’s not me
and I do n’t want to go there .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .   
I folded my arms , looking at the names he ’d put down .   
“
If you like video games
… is there an aesthetic or character or kind of game you could tap into ?
”
“ I ’d be worried about choosing something I get tired of a month from now .
”
“ Just … ” I started , trying to think of a good argument .   
“ Just as a starting point , to get you thinking .
”
“ The space opera game I got from Chris , one of the things he gave me to keep me sane when I ’m out in the middle of nowhere
and I do n’t want to bother Erin .   
Chris , what ’s the Void class I played , the worker one ?
”
“
There are three .   
Miner , welder , and rigger .   
You played either of the last two .
”
Rain nodded to himself , then looked at the board .
He started to write something down .   
He got as far as Rig when I said , “ Rigger and Rig are taken .
”
Rain threw down the marker and he clenched both his tinker and regular hands into fists .   
“
Son of a … ”
“
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news , ” I said .
“
What does it matter ?
” Tristan asked .   
He was still hanging with Chris at the one end of the room .   
“ Names are taken , so what ?   
It ’s not like there ’s a system out there enforcing that stuff .   
Kenzie could call herself Optics
, it ’s not like there ’s a PRT .
”
“ I do n’t want to though , ” Kenzie said .   
“
It gets complicated .
”
“
Okay , but for the sake of argument , ” Tristan said .   
“
Why could n’t she if she wanted to ?
”
“
Rigger or Rig could still be alive , ” I said .   
“
And we do n’t know what ’s going to happen in the future with people picking up where the PRT left off .   
Finding a good name and identity
you ’re comfortable with is hard , and capes tend to be protective of their names as a result .   
Mix - ups and headaches used to be common and we do n’t want to go there .   
People travel to your town to literally fight you over a name .
”
“
I ’m still not sold on the PRT issue , ” Tristan said .   
“
They ’re gone .   
They are n’t coming back .
”
“ The remnants of them are .   
Organizations using their files and methods .   
A military - esque group following the rules and regulations of the PRT ’s code of justice .   
There are headaches involved .
”
There was a knock at the door .   
Sveta started toward it , but Kenzie leaped out of her chair and beat her to it , opening the door .
Kenzie saluted as Ashley entered .   
Ashley had a plastic bag with books and her dress in it .   
She moved those things out of the way , holding them while Kenzie fished the two camera drones out of the bottom of the bag .
“
Good work , ” Tristan said .   
“
Lawyer - person left some tips , but I liked a lot about how you handled that .
”
“
It was very natural ,
” I said .   
“
You ’ll probably like the headaches you gave them , putting them on the spot like you did .   
Kenzie got some of their conversation after .
” Ashley smiled .
“
How was the train ride ?
” Sveta asked .   
“ You might have to go back and forth a bit
, I hope it is n’t too boring .
”
“
It was fine .   
I read a book .   
A baby cried after looking at me
and I was amused .
”
“ A baby cried ?
” Tristan asked .
“ I look intimidating , apparently .
”
“
Or it cried because it ’s a baby , ” Chris said .   
“
Babies cry about everything .   
They ’re stupid like that .
”
“
It cried because of me , ” Ashley said .   
“ I ’ve made enough people cry to know when it ’s because of me .
” Chris shrugged .   
“
I ’ll defer to the expert .
”
“ It could be because you ’re different , ” Kenzie said .   
“
The first house I was in growing up , there were mostly only black people in my neighborhood , and I remember my aunt had a baby and the baby cried whenever he saw a white person .   
It might be like that .   
Except you ’ve got the cool eyes and hair .
”
“ On that topic , ” Ashley said .   
“ Eye .   
Mine ’s bothering me .
”
“
Oh , sure , I ’ll get it , ” Kenzie said .   
She ran to her desk , then ran back to Ashley , who bent down , one hand on Kenzie ’s shoulder .
Sticking a pair of tweezers into Ashley ’s eye , Kenzie grabbed and withdrew the camera .   
It had a flat head like a nail , but the camera ’s body more closely resembled a pin in how thin and long it was , with wires encircling its length in a double - helix .
I winced a little , watching it come out .   
Ashley did n’t seem to mind .
“
I ca n’t stand that , ” Sveta said .   
“
Maybe it ’s because eyes are one of the only things I have , but eeesh .
”
She rattled a bit as she shuddered or mimed a shudder .
“
It ’s phased out , you wimps , ” Kenzie said .   
“
It ’s not actually stabbing anything .   
It treats the eye as a portal and a model and unfolds in non - space using that framework .
”
“ I felt it moving around , ” Ashley said .
“
It ’s mostly not actually stabbing anything , ” Kenzie corrected her statement .   
“ One to three percent in reality at most , stabbing at things .   
Sorry .   
I ’ll fine tune the phase .   
It might be responding to your power .
”
“ I have regular appointments with someone who can give me a replacement if you destroy my eye , ” Ashley said .   
“
I ’m not worried .   
I trust you .
”
“
Awesome , ” Kenzie said , wiping the camera - pin with a tissue .
I was n’t sure it was ‘ awesome’ .   
I knew who that person was .   
Bonesaw .
“ We watched what we could before you left and the flying cameras ran out of battery , ” I said .   
“
Then we talked about plans and did some homework .
”
“ Thinking about names , ” Rain said .
“
Rude jokes about names too , ” Chris said .   
“ Tristan had a good one .
”
“
Glad
I missed that , ” Ashley said .
“
You have a board , just so you know , ” Kenzie said .   
“ You can make notes .
”
“
I ’m fine , ” Ashley said .   
“ What plans were you talking about ?
”
“ We wanted to wait until you were here to do anything , ” I said .   
“ Tattletale ’s a persistent issue .   
She ’s lurking in the background , and she ’s hard to shake .   
Instead of having her looming , it might be nice to rattle her a bit .   
It might be possible to do it in a way that does n’t tip her off about who you guys are or how you ’re operating .
”
“
How ? ”
Ashley asked .
I explained , “ Kenzie can call her old teammates .   
We ’ll offer an exchange .   
A favor for a favor .   
We know that the people in Cedar Point are easily spooked .   
This is new , untested ground , and thanks to you , we know that Prancer is the closest thing they have to a boss
and he ’s inexperienced .   
We can put them on the back foot .
”
“ I ’ll give you the transcript and a recording
so you can check it out on your own time , ”
Kenzie told Ashley .
“
Back foot ?
”
Ashley asked .
“ They ’re easily spooked and Tattletale gave them free questions they can ask .   
They ’ve used some already , and they might have used them all , ” I said .   
“
So … we leverage hero groups and some secondary people .   
They do a one - loop patrol or light investigation , show their faces .
”
“ Pressure , ” Tristan said .   
“
Part of why you patrol in the first place , but we ’re using other people .
”
“ We can apply pressure on our own , ” Ashley said .   
“
We have me , and we have Chris .
”
“ The law student said you should back off a bit , ” Sveta said .   
“
You did a good job of being intimidating and believable .   
It would be better if we stirred the pot some , let them focus on other things , heat dies down .   
There ’s less of a chance they ’ll investigate you if they ’re focused on heroes .
” I jumped in , “ Seeing how you were in Prancer
’s face , I think it might be better to have you keep doing that , than to have you inexplicably be nicer or calmer .   
We just drop you back into Cedar Point when they ’ve already got their hands full
, you get to make them miserable and blindside them .   
They might even turn to you for help .
”
“
And that gives us power , ” Ashley said .
“
And we have a trump card , ” Tristan said .   
“
The recording of the conversation with Tattletale .   
That ’s endgame stuff , but if it turns out she ’s digging and she ’s on our trail
anyway , we can use it to mess with her .   
We can give them the impression she wanted us to pressure them so they ’d use questions and keep buying her services .
” Ashley smiled .
Hm .   
Maybe not the best thing if Ashley was that pleased with my idea .
I decided I had her on board
and I had her playing nice .   
Time to sell her on the more cautious , moderated part of things .   
“
We play this slow , but we can maintain power , we can put them on the back foot , and we have a way of screwing up one of the major players on the bad guy ’s side .   
That last one is the kind of thing we ’ll want to consult outside parties for .   
Tip off the Wardens or one of the big teams that we ’re messing with Tattletale , in case they want that to coincide with something else they ’ve got going on .
”
“
More people involved is more chances a spy gives up the wrong info , ” Chris said .
“ Very true , ” I said .   
“
That ’s where it ’s good to make it
so we ’re only calling people we know and trust .   
Former teammates .   
I think we can reasonably assume the likes of Chevalier are fairly legit .   
Others , we control the information we give them .   
We do this smart .
”
“ I like it , ” Ashley said .
“ I can call my old teammates , ” Kenzie said , collapsing back into her computer chair .   
She put the eyeball - pin camera into a jewelry box .   
“
I do n’t know if they ’ll say yes , but I can try .
”
“ If everything else falls through , I can call Weld and ask if he knows people , ” Sveta said .
“ There are options , ” I said .   
“
I met some people at the community center .   
They might help me out .
”
“ I know people too , ” Ashley said .   
“ From my appointments .   
I can try asking when I next run into them .
”
“
You ’re sure ?   
You actually have hero friends ?
” Tristan asked .
“
No .   
But they ’re heroes other people trust to work with someone like me , we talk , and I can exchange favors with them .
”
“
That ’s awesome , ” Sveta said .
“
I ’ll call mine , first ?
” Kenzie asked .
The others agreed .   
Chris was still in the corner with his phone and comic , and Tristan walked over to grab him , wheeling him to the center of the room
so he ’d participate .   
Chris did crack a smile at that .
“
Still feeling that hit of joy from the other day ?
”
Rain asked .
“
Indulgence , not joy .   
I ’m indulging myself or other people if I smile .
”
“ Shhhh !
”
Kenzie shushed people .   
“
I ’m on the phone .
”
There was a pause .
“
Hi , Houndstooth , ” she said .
Pause .
“ I found it online .
”
Pause .   
Sveta used the break in Kenzie speaking to shoot me a worried look .
“
It ’s technically online .   
It did n’t take much to figure it out .
”
Pause .
“
No , I do n’t want to bother you .   
I ’m part of a different team now
and we ’re doing our thing .   
Yeah .   
We ’re calling people we know and trust and exchanging favors for favors , and I thought I ’d ask you , since you seemed like you might be interested based on how the last conversation went .
” Pause .
“ I thought it went okay , ” Kenzie said , smiling and rolling her eyes .
Pause .
“
It ’s fine .   
Really .   
I ’m
not-
” Pause .
“
Okay , ” she said .   
She pulled the phone away from her ear .   
“
Houndstooth wants to talk to the person in charge of the group .
”
I saw Ashley and Tristan exchange looks .
“ I hate phones , ” Ashley said .
Tristan reached for the phone .
“ Houndstooth .   
I ’m
Capricorn .   
Yeah .   
Team Reach .   
Group of six with a coach that ’s a partial member , kind of .
”
He glanced at me as he said it , and I shrugged .
“ Everyone ’s here .   
We ’ve got a thing going on , we were thinking of cooperating with other groups .   
Can I put you on speaker ?
”
There was a pause .
Kenzie turned around , and hit a key on her keyboard .
An image appeared in the center of our group , and most of us backed away .
A still image of a person .   
He had a sleek , Anubis - like helmet or mask that encapsulated his head .   
His actual outfit was sleek as well , but Western .   
Nothing of an actual houndstooth pattern , ironically .
“
You ’re on speaker , I think , ” Tristan said .
“
Hi guys , ” Houndstooth said .   
He sounded more adult than ‘ kid’ .   
“
I ’ve got to admit ,
I ’m wary .
”
“
Understandable .   
I get that this comes out of nowhere , ” Tristan said .   
“ Listen , this is a take - it - or - leave - it thing , we ’re fine if you decide it ’s too much of a question mark and pass .   
Offer is a favor for a favor .   
There ’s an area we ’re interested in , and we ’re hoping to get some other people showing up there , patrols .   
Maximizing pressure and seeing what we can shake up .
”
“
What area ?
”
“
Ca n’t say until you agree , but it ’s not too dangerous .
”
“ I can think of a few places it could be , especially if you ’re a new team operating in open jurisdictions .   
New Brockton , or one of the Fallen camps , big or small .
”
Kenzie wrote something down .   
She held up the paper .
he ’s
smart “
Less dangerous than that , even , ” Tristan said .
“ We show up , we … patrol , make our presences known .   
What ’s the fallout ?
”
“ Twenty percent chance they pick a fight ?
” Tristan asked .   
He looked around at the group .
“ Ten at most , and only if you stick around .   
I visited and they took half an hour before showing their faces , ” Ashley said .   
“
They wo n’t go for the jugular , either .   
Worst case is they bruise your pride .
”
“
I ’m feeling more like this is one of those places the B - listers are moving to , now .
”
“
No comment , ” Tristan said .
“
Yeah , ” Houndstooth said .   
“
And we can call in a favor in exchange ?   
What sort ?   
You patrol somewhere or help us pull off a complicated arrest ?
”
Kenzie pointed to herself .
“
We ’ve got Optics , who ’s not calling herself Optics anymore , for one thing , ” Sveta spoke up .
“ You ’re lucky , ” Houndstooth said .   
Kenzie sat up straighter .
“
…
but I ’m thinking in other directions .
”   
Houndstooth finished .   
Kenzie slouched in her seat .
“
What kind of directions ?
” Tristan asked .
“
I ’m thinking .   
Capricorn , can I hold onto this favor without naming it ?
” Tristan looked around .   
There were a few nods .   
Tristan said , “ Sure .   
That was my original take on how this would go .   
The others seem cool with that .   
I ’ll give you my phone number .
” Tristan gave his number .   
There was a break while Houndstooth took it down .
“
If you ’re game , I think we can let you know where we ’re thinking of , ” I said .   
The others nodded , so I added , “ Cedar Point .   
Hollow Point in villain vernacular .
”
“ You know , ” Houndstooth said .   
“
It bothered me that it was n’t being looked after .
”
“
That was my feeling too ,
” I said .
“ Who ’s speaking , can I ask ?
”
“ Victoria Dallon .   
I used to be Glory Girl , and I ’m the coach , so to speak .
”
“ I know the name .   
Hi .   
You ’re wanting to rattle these guys ?
”
“
That ’s the basic idea , ” I said .
“
Basic idea ?   
Even before you said that , I had the impression there was a less basic part to the idea .   
Am I right about there being more to this ?
”
“
Some .   
Nothing that impacts you negatively , ” I said .
Tristan spoke up , “ We ’re hoping to tap some others , maintain pressure , and hold off on getting personally involved until we know how much reach these guys really have .
”
“ They ’re bit players .   
This thing happens now and again .   
It tends to self - combust .
”
Tristan looked at me .
Passing the ball to me ?   
I said , “ We know how much reach they probably have , and there ’s some .
”
“
Interesting .
”
I went on , “
Personally speaking , I do n’t want this to combust .   
Some skirmishes are probably inevitable , but these guys are n’t , as was said earlier , going to go for the jugular .   
I want to keep it limited to that .
”
“ I do n’t want to see any places combusting either .   
If you think it ’s safe and if you want to help save Cedar Point , I think I can sell my team on a patrol or two .
”
“
That ’d be great , ” Tristan said .
“ If something happens and we get in over our heads , you back us up or call the bigger names ?
”
“
Of course , ” Tristan said .   
“
Probably the latter .   
We ’ve got kids and stuff , and we ’ve been urged on multiple fronts to keep on the down - low .
”
Ashley looked annoyed at that .
“
Alright , ” Houndstooth said .   
“ Hm .   
I know another team that might be okay doing something similar , if you ’re wanting to get others on board .   
I can put you in touch with them , but I ’d want a minor favor .   
One
I already have in mind .
”
“ If they ’re trustworthy and wo n’t spill our role in things or why people are showing interest in Cedar Point .   
What ’s the favor ?
”
“ They are trustworthy .   
Before I commit my team , I want to meet you guys
face to face .   
Grab a coffee or something .   
Glory Girl and Capricorn and whoever else is in a leadership position .
”
Kenzie sunk further in her seat , so low her head could n’t roll backward off the back of the chair .   
Instead , she slid to one side , her head closer to the armrest .   
She indicated herself , pointing , eyes rolling back so the whites showed .
“ I think that should be fine , ” Tristan said .   
He looked at Kenzie , and she nodded , exaggerated .   
“
Yeah .   
That ’s good .
”
“
Great .   
The team I ’m thinking of is Auzure .   
Corporate .
”
“ I know them , ” I said .   
“
I ’m not sure they ’re my top choice .
”
“ I do n’t recommend them lightly , ” Houndstooth said .   
“
They ’re by - the - book , serious , they ’re strong for a small team , they stick to their word , and they ’re looking for opportunities to get out there .
”
“ That last bit is what concerns me , ” I said .   
“
They ’re looking for exposure and this team wants more subtlety .   
We want the villains in Cedar Point wondering why heroes are there and tapping their resources .
”
“
And you get to see what resources they have .
”
“
Basically , ” I said .
“ You keep using that word
and I keep realizing
you ’ve really got a plan .
Okay .   
I think I like this .   
Auzure is out , then ?   
That ’s your gut feeling ?
”
“
Can I put you on mute while I confer ?
” I asked .   
“
I ’m just the coach , I do n’t want to make decisions .
”
“ Yep .
”
Kenzie sat up and hit a key on her keyboard .   
A red ‘ x’ appeared over the mouth and ears of the hologram image of Houndstooth .
Really weird that she had that , I noted .
“
What ’s up ?
” Tristan asked .
“ I interviewed for Auzure .   
They were just a bit sleazy .   
Greedy .   
Their reason for interviewing me was to get at my family , just as one example of a red flag that came up .   
My feeling is if you guys bring them in , they ’ll try to do something flashy or get more involved than you want them .
”
“ If that ’s the case , I ’d rather avoid them , ” Sveta said .
“
They sound like the bad kind of corporate team , ” Tristan said .   
“
But I might be biased .   
Okay .   
Any thoughts ?   
Objections ?
”
“
We could use them in a limited capacity , ” I said .   
“
Have them make a phone call , instead of actually showing up .
”
“
Phone call ?
”
Rain asked .
“
Yeah .   
Can I just see what Houndstooth says to this ?
”
“
Sure , ” Tristan said .   
“ Unmute . ”
“ Houndstooth , ” I said .
“
I ’m here .
”
“
In the interest of keeping Auzure involved in only a limited capacity , what if we had them call someone and ask about renting space ?   
No commitment , just see if the person reports it to the villains in town .   
The villains would probably stress over the notion .
”
“
Stress you want .   
Yeah .   
Could work .
”
“
Ideally , we ’d ask Auzure to call when Auzure is busy .
”
“ You do n’t want them in your jurisdiction ?
”
“ …
Yeah .
”   
I said .   
I almost said ‘ basically’ .
“ I hear you .   
Yeah .   
I think they ’ve got something going on right now .   
Rumors of war on the horizon .   
Earth C.   
If you used them in the next week , I do n’t think they ’d pick up on hints .
”
“ We ’d need to figure out who we want Auzure to call , so that the person called might tip off the villains .   
It might be tight to get that information in a week , but
yeah .
”
“ You ’ve got Kenzie .   
I think you ’ll do just fine on that front .
”
I looked at Kenzie , expecting her to perk up .   
She smiled , but she did n’t really show much more enthusiasm at the praise .
“ We ’ll have that face to face meeting , ” Tristan said .   
“
We can hammer out particulars then .
”
“
Yes .   
I ’ll call you after I ’ve raised the idea with my team , and we ’ll figure out a time to meet .   
I ’ll keep quiet on it being Cedar Point until they ’re on board .
”
“ Great , ” Tristan said .   
“ I ’ll let you go now .
”
“
Alright .   
Another day , Capricorn .
”
The phone call ended .
“
I like him , ” I said .   
I looked at Kenzie .   
“ Good recommendation .
”
“
Yup , ” she said .   
“
He ’s going to want to dish out all the super embarrassing dirt on me from two years ago .   
Uggh .
”
“
We know the dirt , ” Rain said .   
“
Most of us .
”
“ Uugh , ” Kenzie groaned .   
“
It ’s like having friends over and your parents bringing out the photo album .   
Except way , way worse , because I was n’t a baby when I messed up with Houndstooth around , and it ’s so much worse than being in the tub or having food on my face .
”
“
We know your history , we know you ’ve made great strides , ” Sveta said .   
“
I ca n’t speak for the others , but to me , you ’re about those strides and those successes .   
You ’re not defined by your worst days .
”
“ Uuuuuuggh , ” Kenzie said .
“
Right ? ”
Sveta pressed .
“
Yeah , ” Kenzie said .
“
It did n’t sound like that call was easy to make .   
If Houndstooth is on the up - and - up , then it was a really , really good recommendation , ” I said .
“ He is .   
He ’s one of the best true - blue heroes I know ,
” Kenzie said , smiling a little .
“
Two teams we can use to apply some pressure and get Cedar Point to reach out to Tattletale , ” Tristan said .
“ Even if they catch on , they ’ll be left wondering .   
Heroes on your turf are n’t something you can ignore .   
Ignoring that makes you look weak , ” Ashley said .
I nodded .
And one way or another , we would strain the relationship with this group and Tattletale , and make them less likely or able to call on her when we made our play .
This worked .
Kenzie stood from her seat , walking over to her board .   
She began copying down a redacted version of the scribbled - down tinker notes from before .
She was bothered , that much was clear .   
Now she was stepping away to dwell on the tinker stuff .   
That did n’t seem like the worst thing in the world .
On one wall , the one operating camera drone was showing a view of Cedar Point .   
Sunny , largely abandoned , and a little rough around the edges , covered in graffiti with broken things here and there from a riot or protest that had n’t been cleaned up after .
The group was talking amongst themselves , about what needed to be done and arranged .
“ Rain ’s thing needs some attention , ” Tristan said .
“ We can talk some about that tonight , and talk more tomorrow .   
Offer for an escort stands , Rain .
”
“ Nah , ” he said .   
“ I do n’t want to play that card yet .
”
“ Kenzie said she could do some of the surveillance from home , but we ’ll probably want to meet here if we meet , ”
Tristan said .   
“
Kenzie will be a regular .   
I can come once in a blue moon .
”
“ I ’ll be here when I ’m not there , ” Ashley said .   
“ If I ’m holding off , then I ’ll be here for the next bit .
”
“ Cool , ” Kenzie said , turning .   
She ’d added something to the board .   
‘ Name ?   
Look - see / Looksee’.’
“
I ’ll be here too ,
” Chris said .   
He ’d stood from his chair and was walking around Kenzie ’s desk , peering at the tinker stuff .   
“ Or around here .   
Sometimes I just sit around outside or find a place to read comics or watch stuff on my phone .
”
I saw Kenzie nod to herself , glancing back over one shoulder at Chris
. ‘ Cool’ , she ’d said .   
I was n’t sure it was .   
I had n’t quite anticipated this , but with people being where they were , with the older members helping Rain , Ashley being available for surveillance , it meant Kenzie and Chris and Ashley would be spending more extended periods of time together .
Or , put another way , the ex - Slaughterhouse Nine member and the two ‘ kids’ of the team .
“ I ’ll stop in regularly , ” I said .   
“
Keep an eye on things .
”
“
Yep , ” Sveta said .   
“ Rotate or something ?   
With overlap , because you and I need to hang out .
”
“ Naturally , ” I said , smiling .   
She ’d picked up on the same concerns I had .
“
A few of us here at any given time , ” Tristan said .
There was a bit more conversation , hashing out particulars of schedule , as well as who was available on what days .
“ I could stop in at Cedar Point .   
They know I was poking my head in before , but there ’s no reason to let them think
I ’m
gone and dealt with , ” I said .
“ You ’ve got the hero itch , ” Sveta said .
“
It ’s not the hero itch , ”
I said .   
“
It ’s that Tattletale told me to go away
and it means something if I do n’t .
”
“
It ’s the-
”
“ Chris !
”
Kenzie raised her voice .
Chris froze .   
He was leaning close to her projector box .   
Stuff was piled on top .
“
Do not touch my bag !
”
she said , way louder and more intense than was necessary .
“ Not touching a thing , ” he said .   
“ Relax .
”
“ I ’m not going to relax !   
Back off !
”
“
What , is it going to blow up or something ?
”
he asked , with a chuckle .
Kenzie strode forward , through the group , “ Step back and leave my stuff alone !
”
“
I did n’t touch anything .   
Really .
”
“ Kenzie , ” Sveta said .   
“
He did n’t touch anything .
”
“
And stop saying my stuff is going to blow up !
”
Kenzie said , volume still raised .   
She shot Chris a look and smiled .   
“
Pretty please ?   
It ’s really not funny .
”
“
That was my fault , ” I said .   
“
I brought it up first .   
I ’ve dealt with tinkers and hyperdimensional tech makes me nervous .
”
“
You ’re fine , ” Kenzie said .   
“
You ’ve been cool .   
I like you .   
I have more mixed feelings about Chris .   
And I have very strong feelings about things like my bag being messed with .
”
Chris threw his hands up , retreated to the chair that Tristan had initially brought to the edge of where everyone was standing , and kicked at the ground , wheeling himself back to his corner .
I met Sveta ’s eyes .   
We communicated more or less telepathically : more supervision would be needed .
Kenzie was now rummaging , gathering her stuff and getting it organized .   
She had what looked like a gym bag , white with pink piping as trim , and big plastic zipper tabs .   
She put stuff in it and then picked it up .
“
Want to have a chat , Kenz ?
” I asked .
She drew in a deep breath and sighed heavily , bag held close .   
“ Fine .
”
“
It ’s not obligatory , ” I said .
“
It ’s fine .   
Yes .   
Chat .   
You ’re cool .   
Some people are n’t .
”
“
Referring to yourself ?
” Chris asked .
“
Not helping , Chris , ” Tristan called out .
I led Kenzie out the side door , to the fire escape that was the access to the mostly unfurnished apartment .   
The air outside was far warmer than the air inside .   
It was late in the afternoon .
“
Sorry , ” Kenzie said .   
She put her bag down on one corner of the fire escape , then leaned against the railing , looking down as she wound her foot around the strap .
“
It ’s okay , ” I said .
“
I ’m really glad you ’re here , ” she said .   
“
And I kind of like that you do n’t know all the bad stuff .
”
“
You ’re worried about what Houndstooth is going to say ?
”
“ I do n’t like being embarrassed , ” she said .   
“
And it ’s really , really embarrassing .
” I did n’t like standing over her , so I walked over to where the stairs met the little platform of rusty slats and sat down sideways with my back to the exterior wall of the building .   
Not facing her directly , but I could comfortably look her way .
“ I hear you , ” I said .   
“
I said it before , but I ’m grateful you were willing to get closer to that territory to help everyone out .   
I have things I do n’t like thinking about or getting into
and I know what it takes to go there .
”
“ I did n’t even really think about it so it ’s not all that , ” Kenzie said .
“
Are you okay ?
” I asked .   
“ Is there anything I can do ?
”
“
Talking is good , ” Kenzie said , eyes on where the strap was wound around her ankle and foot .   
“
You ever- have you ever been so humiliated that you wished the earth would open up and swallow you up ?
”
“ I think everyone has .   
It ’s part of being young , that you fumble your way through things .
”
“
Urgh , ” she said .   
“
I …
I once embarrassed myself really , really badly .
”
“
Yeah .
”
“
And it was n’t just one earth that split open but a multiverse of them .   
I was so humiliated an alien actually noticed and reached between those earths and into my head .   
And now I-
everything ’s messy and hard .
”
“ Sveta and the others seem to think you ’re doing better .
”
“ I am .   
I ’m mostly good .   
I backslide now and again , but I get a handle on things
and I have people who help when I do .
”
“
That ’s good , ” I said .   
“
That ’s an achievement , especially when you ’ve got an alien tied to you .   
You ’re swimming with an anchor around your waist , and you ’ve reached the shallow water .   
That ’s incredible .
” Kenzie nodded .   
She did n’t smile .
“
He saw me not long after everything went wrong .   
And then he saw me a while later when I joined his team and I was n’t exactly great then either .   
Even if he saw me at my best now I do n’t know if he ’d be able to look past all the bad he ’s seen before .
”
“ You might not be giving him enough credit , ” I said .
“ Maybe , ” Kenzie said .   
“
But I might be giving him just enough credit , and I might be really worried that this cool heroine who ’s helping us out might see or hear about the bad
and then she not be able to see past it , either .
”
“
The others have heard some of it , have n’t they ?
”
“ From my mouth .   
That ’s different .
”
“
They ’ve heard it and they want you on their team .   
They respect you .   
Whatever happens , I do n’t think Houndstooth can say anything that ’s going to have more weight than what Sveta says , because Sveta ’s awesome and I respect her a ton .
”
“
She ’s great , ” Kenzie said , staring down at her feet .   
“
She ’s the best .
”
“
And , ” I said , pausing .   
“
Whatever he says , I do n’t think it should have more weight than what you say , either .   
Not when people like Sveta trust and respect you and I trust and respect her .   
Okay ?
” Kenzie sniffed .   
A slightly runny nose , now .   
She was n’t crying that I could see , but she might ’ve been close .
“
Can I give you a hug ?
” I asked .
“
No , ” She said .   
She stooped down and picked up her bag .   
She craned her head around , and looked through the window .
The window was opaque , the surface blurred .   
Kenzie ’s tech , I realized .
“
Come , ” Kenzie said .   
Bag in her arms , she hauled the door open , and held it for me as I followed .
The others were watching .   
Sveta was on her way to the door , no doubt to let us know what was going on .
Two people were in the center of the camera
’s focus , walking down the streets of Cedar Point .
I recognized one as Snag , and I could guess the other was the woman of Rain ’s cluster .
Rain turned his head , looking at me .








It was Sveta who said it , not Rain .   
“ If they go inside , we ’re going to lose track of what they ’re saying .
”
“
Have they said anything yet ?
” I asked .
“
No , ” Rain said .   
“
The woman does n’t talk so it would be a one - sided conversation .   
If they ’re here , they ’re here for something .   
I want to know what .
”
“ Anything you guys do risks blowing your surveillance , ” I said .   
“
You might gain more information if you leave it alone .   
Just saying .
”
“
I might miss something vital , ” Rain said .
“ You might , ” I said .   
“
It ’s really up to you guys .   
If you need help , I ’ll back you up .
”
Tristan walked forward , and half - sat on the desk , head turned so he could keep one eye on the image .   
“
Hypothetically , if we did act on this , what would we be doing ?   
Picking a fight ?
”
“ We could , ” Ashley said .   
“ Rain said they were injured and needed maintenance .   
It would be timely , it would keep them injured and out of the picture .
”
“ On their turf ?
” Tristan asked .   
“ With who knows how many villains in the immediate area ?
”
“
And it would blow our surveillance , like Victoria said , ” Sveta said .
“ You ’ve been quiet on why they ’re after you , Rain , ” Chris said .   
“
You never talked about your trigger event .
”
“ As a rule , it ’s not good to ask people about their trigger events , ” Sveta said .
“ As a rule , ” Chris said , “ It ’s vital information about who we ’re fighting and why they ’re doing what they ’re doing . ”
“ Chris , ” Sveta said .
“ Sveta , ” Chris said .   
“ Detach from your emotions , focus more on their emotions .   
Are they passionate ?   
Driven ?   
Is it personal ?   
If any or all of the above are true , it changes the rules of how they act .   
They might act even if they are injured or needing to do some maintenance .
”
“
People do n’t act by rules , ” Tristan said .
“ Some people do , ” Chris said .   
“ Byron does , or did , based on what you said .   
They might .   
But we need more of what Rain knows about who and what they are and where they come from to know that .
”
Kenzie turned around in her seat .   
“
I was just telling Victoria
I did n’t like the idea of her prying into my past or where I come from .   
It would feel pretty gross and unfair if we pushed Rain to do it now , when he obviously does n’t want to .
”
“
Hypocritical might be the word you ’re looking for , ” I said .
“
I ’m learning so many words today , ” Kenzie said .
“
Putting all that aside , is there any way to listen in , if they went inside ?
”
Rain asked .   
“
They ’re a block away from where Prancer went before .   
If they go there , what can we do ?
”
“
I could rig something , ” Kenzie said .   
“
But it would be fragile and iffy .
”
“ I ca n’t help but notice we ’re changing the subject , ” Chris said .
“ Look .   
Just-
I need this , ” Rain said .   
“ I ’ve told Tristan everything
and I ’ve told Sveta some of it .   
If Tristan thinks it needs to be said , he can say it .   
He ’s more objective .   
But I really want to know what they might say , I want to start making preparations now .
”
“ I ’ve been keeping my mouth shut , ” Tristan said .   
“
I ’m in a weird place , knowing what I do , not wanting to betray a friend .   
I feel like if I said anything at all , even if the reasons were good , it would still be betraying Rain .
”
“
I can take apart things , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Kludge it together for an emergency thing .   
It wo n’t take long
but we ’d need Sveta to hurry over there to plant it and that ’ll take a few minutes .   
If that ’s what we ’re doing .   
I do n’t want to break my things down if we ’re not doing this , though .  
”
“ I ’m probably going to regret saying this , but I ’ll stand up for Kenzie , ” Chris said .   
“
It ’s going to be shitty if she starts taking apart good work
so she can get it done in time , and then Rain does n’t hold up his end any .   
That ’s not fair and it ’s going to lead to resentment .
”
“ I do n’t care about fair , ” Kenzie said .   
“
But thank you , Chris .
”
“
Do n’t thank me .
”
“
I ’m going to anyway .   
It means a lot .
”
“
No it does n’t .   
I just do n’t want the headaches , ” Chris said .   
“
And Rain is being the biggest headache on the team .   
Maybe except for me , but I do n’t have anyone trying to kill me
and I ’m not really asking for anything ,
so I think I can get away with it .
”
Rain ran his fingers through his hair , turned and took a step to one side , like he was going to walk away or pace , and then stopped , because he could n’t take his attention off the screen .
Tristan was in a hard place , knowing what he did but having a friendship on the line , Sveta maybe was n’t as much of a friend to Rain
but she was also more sensitive and kind , and she did n’t know as much .   
Rain did n’t really have other allies in the group he could turn to .   
Certainly not Ashley .   
Not Chris .   
Kenzie just wanted to know if she should get started building her thing .
Somehow , he ended up looking at me .   
He looked spooked .
“ If Kenzie builds the thing , I can fly over and plant it , ” I said .   
“
I do n’t mind showing my face there , it fits with the plan , there ’s a lower risk of the surveillance operation getting discovered , it works .
”
Rain nodded , tense .
“
But I do think Chris may be right .   
If the group is extending a hand to you and you ’re not extending trust back , that may not be fair .   
You should share something .
”
“ Okay , ” Rain said .
Kenzie spun around .   
She grabbed one of her flying eyes and pried open the side , pulling out a black rectangle .   
She swapped it with a spare .
“
It ’s personal , ” Rain said .   
“
It ’s emotional .   
Not helped by the dreams , by the possible personality bleed across the cluster .   
Some things I ’ve caught lately made me think there might be some .
”
I listened , my expression still , arms folded , mostly watching what Kenzie did while Rain talked .   
I was going to have to deploy this thing .
Kenzie popped open the jewelry case with the camera she ’d put in Ashley ’s eye , then tore off the section under the lens .   
She flicked at parts with her fingers to get them spinning and then held onto others , unscrewing them in the process .
“ They blame me , for the events around the trigger .   
I ’ve told Sveta all of this .   
The dreams are biased , selective , cherry picking from my perceptions .   
They make me out to be more of a bad guy than I am .
”
“ I do n’t think you ’re a bad guy at all , ” Tristan said .
“
I ’m not a good guy either .   
And maybe that ’s because of the bleed coming the other way .   
I feel like a completely different person than I was then .   
And I know
–
I think Snag is too .   
I ’ve seen his perspective and his dreams , and he ’s willing to murder now ?   
Maybe the agent took half of my anger from back then and divided it among them , aiming it back at me .
”
“
What happened ?
” Ashley asked .
“ I fucked up .   
I had a chance to save them and I did n’t , ” Rain said .
I looked away from where Kenzie was spinning things to screw in the eye - camera beneath the major lens of the flying eye , looked at Rain , and saw how miserable he was .
“ How does Erin fit in ?
” Sveta asked .
“ She does n’t .   
She knows the story but she has n’t seen the dreams .   
I think if she saw the dreams like the three members of the cluster did , she ’d hate me too .   
But she does n’t .
”
“ And ‘ of 5 ? '
” Chris asked .
I turned my head .
“
My username , online , ” Rain explained .   
“ I do n’t know what happened to the fifth .   
It ’s complicated .   
I can think of a few people it might be .   
People that did n’t make it .
”
Kenzie turned around .   
The camera looked worse for wear .   
I realized it was the nice one , with the adaptive camouflage or whatever it was .   
Panels were missing and wires exposed .   
She beckoned me to approach .   
I did .
“ Put the lens side against the wall or the roof .   
There ’s a plunger on the side here , you see ?
”
In a groove along the side , normally meant to aid in aerodynamics or something , the metal rod ran flush with the body .
“ I see , ” I said .   
I looked at the screen .   
They ’d walked past the place where Prancer had gone inside .
“
Put it up against the surface , then slowly , super slowly push that in .   
There ’s no resistance built in , so you could push it in in half a second if you were n’t careful .
”
“ What would happen ?
”
“ We ’d lose it .   
That ’s four days worth of work and the eye camera is six days worth of work , and some of those parts were hard to get .   
Please do n’t push it in fast .
”
“
How slow do I depress it ?
”
“
Um .   
Take , like , a minute , to get it from here to here , if you can .   
Be ready to stop if I tell you to .
”
“ How are we communicating ?
”
“ Phone ?
” Kenzie asked .
“ Phone , ” I said .   
“
Got it .
”
I checked
I had my phone with me , that it had battery , and then got my earbuds , plugging them into the phone and then putting one into my ear .   
I collected the football - sized camera .
“ Give me something to eat ?
” I asked .   
“ Granola bar or something ?
” Chris walked over to his bag , fished for something , and then tossed me a bag of chips .   
I caught it , then caught the paper - wrapped meal he threw my way .   
I put everything into a bag .   
My mask , computer and notebook were in the bag already , which was good .
“
It ’s not kiss - kill , ” Rain said .   
“
Or , like Victoria said a few days ago
, it ’s kiss - kill with good cover .   
I ’m weaker than them , and the dreams give them a reason to hate me .
”
“
I ’m good to go ?
” I asked .
“ I think so .   
Thanks for doing this , ” Sveta said .
I gave her a pat on the shoulder as I passed .
“
Thank you , ”
Rain said , with sincerity .
I was at the door when Tristan said , “ Might not need the camera after all .
”
I looked back .
They had n’t gone indoors .   
They were in a parking lot .   
A group of people was standing around a van .   
They had masks on .
“
I ’m still going to go ,
” I said .   
“
We do n’t know where they ’ll go or what they ’ll do .   
Patch me in somehow ?
”
“
I ’ll video call you , ” Kenzie said .   
“
We ’ll talk to you and you can look at your phone to see what ’s happening .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .   
“
That works .   
That ’s going to do a number on my monthly limit .   
I might have to get an unlimited plan .
”
“ They do n’t have any of those anymore , not after the end of the world , ” Kenzie said .   
“ I checked .   
And they get peeved at me when I borrow anything , so I have to be really careful with my cameras and junk .
”
I could have responded , but I did n’t want to get stuck in a conversation .   
I let myself outside , then flew from the top of the fire escape .
Might have to have a conversation with the big hero teams to see if they have any options , I thought .   
It would be nice to have the fancy earbuds that the Wards used to have , or just a special phone plan that let us handle higher - bandwidth operations .
My phone rang in my ear , startling me even though I ’d expected it .   
I thumbed at my phone to answer it .   
Rather than any of the others , it was the audio from Kenzie ’s camera , observing the interaction between Snag and the group in the parking lot .
“ …
Snag .   
This is Love Lost , ” Snag said .   
Recognizable enough .   
His voice was a deep growl .   
That was his ordinary voice , it seemed .
“
Love Lost ?   
Should n’t it be No Love Lost ?
”
There was a brief pause .
“
She does n’t talk , ” Snag said .
“ That might make negotiations hard .
”
“
We ’ll be fine , ” Snag said .   
“ I ’ll cover things .
”
“ Your friend is n’t coming ?   
Cradle ?
”
Cradle was the potential third , then .
“
He is n’t .   
Just me , just her .
”
“ I ’m
Secondhand , this is Last Minute , Final Hour , and
End of Days .
”
Still flying , I pulled my phone from my pocket , being careful not to drop it .   
I hated using my phone while airborne .   
It was so easy to let my guard down .
“
Your name does n’t match , ” Snag said .
“
I do n’t mind , ”
Secondhand said .
I could see the image on my phone .   
I made the reel gesture to zoom in on the one I was n’t familiar with .   
Tall , with an elongated face and head , bald , with an elaborate waxed mustache , and round sunglasses .   
He wore suspenders over a shirt that was rolled up to the elbows .   
The arms crossed over his chest were muscled .   
A bit of a steampunk vibe , even though his clothes were n’t that old fashioned .
The time manipulators had another teammate , then .
“ You wanted to meet .   
Here we are , ”
Secondhand said .
“ We ’re similar in how we approach things , ” Snag said .   
“
Maybe we can trade , teach each other something .
”
“ Maybe , ” Secondhand said .   
“ Sounds good .
”
“ Maybe the deal ’s lopsided in your favor , but you give us a hand when we need it .
”
“
Ah , I thought that was coming .   
We heard you were recruiting .
”
“
Mm hmm , ” Snag made the sound , and it came off more like growl than agreement .
“
The more the merrier ?
” another member of the Speedrunner ’s group asked .   
It might have been End of Days .
“
The more the merrier , ” Snag repeated , sounding the furthest thing from merry .
“
Why do n’t you take a look and tell us what this means to you ? ”
Secondhand asked .
There was a pause .   
I looked at my phone .   
The back door of the van opened .   
Snag approached , with the woman -Love
Lost?- hanging a bit back .   
She had curved claws at her fingertips and thumb , with a thin framework of rods and bands at the back of her hands to keep those claws in place .   
She had more glittering around her feet and ankle .   
A mask covered her lower face .
“ Victoria ?
”
Sveta asked , through the phone .
“
What ’s up ?
”
I asked , holding the phone to my ear , so I could use the mouthpiece there .
“
Kenzie ’s handling the camera and things .   
I ’m hanging back ,
Tristan ’s close .   
We ’ll be your people , mostly .   
Can you tell us anything about the Speedrunners ?
”
I was glad I ’d checked my books and notes .
“
Seattle .   
B - list villains , but that ’s partially because Seattle was setting a really high bar around the time they were active ,
” I said .   
“ Partially .   
They ’re time manipulators , but complicated by the fact that they have at least one tinker in the group .   
It could be that they ’re all tinkers .   
A family thing like how forcefields run in my family .
”
“ They do n’t look like family , ” I heard a voice .   
It might have been Chris , or Rain speaking with a funny tone .   
Probably Chris .
“
That ’s what they ’re talking about sharing , then , ” I heard Tristan .   
“
Tinker know - how .
”
“
Probably .   
Um .   
Each of them has a power , but they augment that by having tinker stuff they wear .   
Secondhand can cover a lot of ground really fast , but ca n’t affect anyone or do much while he ’s doing it .   
Ca n’t hurt you , ca n’t move stuff , ca n’t set traps .   
But we already talked briefly about him earlier .   
He ’s the one doing regular sweeps of the area , looking for trouble .   
The tinker stuff he wears reduces the strain on his body and lets him operate like that for longer .   
And it means that when he pops out of that mode , he does it with a boom .   
It gives him some offensive ability .
”
“ That does n’t feel B - list , ” Tristan said .
“ I ’ll get to that momentarily .   
I ’m doing these guys out of order .   
Final Hour , he has a targeted slow .   
One target at a time , if he ’s aware of them , he can slow them , as an ongoing thing .   
He can swap it with a moment ’s notice .   
Tinker gear applies other effects to slowed targets .   
Makes it so being slow also crushes you and makes it hard to breathe , or chills you .   
Makes it so he can target a friend and make it so they fall slow , and reduce the impact of their landings .   
He had a thing which screwed with- ”
“
This works , ”
Snag ’s growl interrupted me .   
“
I could do something with this , if I had time to study it .   
I could use the engines you ’ve got here to make emotion effects I channel through my tech last longer , or prolong battery life .
”
“
Good , ” Secondhand said .
A pause .   
A metal on metal sound .
“
What ’s she saying ?
”
Secondhand asked .
“
Love Lost likes that .   
She thinks she could do something with it .   
Right ?   
Yeah .
”
“
Alright .   
Does n’t tell me much , ”
Secondhand said .   
“
How about you show us something ?
”
“
It ’s damaged , but you should get the picture , ” Snag said .
I checked the phone .   
He was using one of his overlong , mechanical arms to pull off his other arm , holding it out by gripping it at the midpoint , the shoulder near End of Days and the hand near Secondhand .
It was my first clean look at the whole group of Speedrunners , as Kenzie zoomed in the camera .
Secondhand was fairly normal in build , with goggles and a flat - top cap .   
He managed to not look old - fashioned .
Last Minute was shorter , stout , with a lot of muscle and fat both .   
His gadgets hung from a high - tech belt .
Final Hour was more muscular , with tech wrapped around one of his arms , ending in a blunt design that resembled a brass hairdryer , with red smoke pouring from the fans and vents along its length .   
Aside from the brass helmet he wore , which covered his entire head the armor covered only half of his body .
End of Days , well , I ’d already gotten a look at him .   
He wore a mask that wrapped around his head in a broad band , from eyebrow to cheekbone , with the black sunglasses on top of that , but it was hard to imagine how he ’d be less recognizable when his facial shape , lack of hair , and mustache were all so apparent .
“ Keep going , ” Tristan said .
Where had I been ?   
Final Hour , right .   
“
He could attach an EMP thing to his slow that slightly hampered powers , made machinery grind to a halt .   
All through this oversized thing he wore that covered his arm and hand .
”
“
He ’s wearing it now , ” Sveta said .
“ Okay , right , ca n’t see while I ’ve got the phone to my ear .   
Foresight said they were using Final Hour to mask their business dealings .   
He was their heavy hitter and he might still be .   
I was thinking he might be using the EMP thing or something like it to keep people from looking in .
”
“ I hope they do n’t use it , ” Kenzie said .
“ Probably would n’t work outdoors , ” I said .   
“
Last Minute moves things backward in time .   
Emphasis on things .   
Not people .   
Carries an assortment of tinker boomerangs , bombs , weapons .   
If Secondhand did n’t have the tinker - ish name , and if there was n’t a chance they were all lesser tinkers , I ’d say Last Minute was a contender for the team ’s tinker , with his arsenal .
”
“
What ’s the catch , or what ’s the tinker component ?
” Tristan asked .
“
From what little I remember , his gadgets do n’t act the same when moving in reverse , or it has added functionality while being reversed .
”
“ Fuck me , ” someone said .   
I thought I heard someone else groan , too .
“
Yeah .   
Boomerangs fly a different path , or split apart so one version carries forward and one retraces its path , ” I said .   
“
That sort of thing .
”
I ’d slowed while flying , and now I stopped .   
I did n’t want to enter the territory and draw attention when it was n’t quite time .   
I had a sense of what Birdbrain and Braindead did , and there was a risk Secondhand would do a patrol when the meeting concluded , to see what their potential business partners were doing .
I settled on a roof , walking as I landed , then stopping to stand on the corner of the roof .   
Cedar Point was on the other side of the water , on a peninsula across from me .
“
End of Days ?
” Tristan asked .
“
I do n’t have a clue , ” I said .   
“
Nothing about name or appearance stands out to me .
”
“
Fuck , ”
I heard a voice .   
Rain , I was guessing .
“
Why are they B - list ?
” Tristan asked .   
Not the first time he ’d touched on that .
“
Because the tinker stuff is limited .   
The batteries take time to charge , ” I said .   
“ When they were active in Seattle , they had something like twenty days between the jobs they pulled , and they had weaknesses .   
The batteries ran out if engagements were prolonged and once that happens they lose a lot of their muscle .
”
“
They might have recruited End of Days to cover that weakness , ” Tristan said .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
It ’s not out of the question .
”
The Speedrunners took longer to examine Snag ’s arm than Snag had taken to examine whatever they ’d shown him .   
I watched through my phone , grieved a bit for my monthly limits , and waited .
On the screen , Love Lost stepped away from the meeting , walking down the length of the parking lot .   
She stood with her back to the group , hands at her sides , fingers and claws spread .
“ I like her , ” Ashley said .   
“ Good style .   
It ’s going to be a shame to smash her face in .
”
“ If we engage her , ” Sveta said .   
“
If we even go that far .
”
“
Of course , ” Ashley said .
“
What ’s she doing ?
”
I asked , more to myself than to the group .
It took a few more seconds , but someone walked down the street .   
A woman with a purple hood and antlers .
Prancer ’s partner .
“
Love Lost saw her coming , ” Tristan said .
“
Sensed , ” I corrected .
“
The woman- Love Lost , she has the emotion aspect of the power , ” Rain said .   
“
Maybe it includes some emotion sense .   
Detecting people .
”
“
If so , I ’m
glad I did n’t just drop in nearby , ” I said .
Velvet said something .   
The camera did n’t catch it .
“
Sorry !
” Kenzie said .   
“
Sorry !   
I did n’t have the sound camera turned that way .   
It ’s finnicky .
”
“
Do n’t turn it toward those two , stay focused on Snag ’s group , ” Tristan said .   
“ Velvet ’s already walking away .
”
“
It was brief , ” Rain said .   
“
I think she ’s just checking on things , making sure it ’s all peaceful .
”
Love Lost rejoined the group .
“
What did the queen of Hollow Point want ?
”
Secondhand asked .
Love Lost was silent .
“
Right .
”
“
Are you done with my arm ?
” Snag asked .
“
Oh , yes .   
Go ahead .
”
“ Mm .
”
“ I have a question , and it ’s one
I ’d regret not asking , ” Secondhand said .   
“
Who are you with ?
”
“ With ? ” Snag asked .   
“ Ourselves .
”
“ I ’ll elaborate .   
We ’ve got a few cliques forming already .   
Bitter Pill in charge of the brains , watching , listening , planning the longer - term plays .   
Not necessarily here , mind you .   
Could be jobs elsewhere .
”
“
Mm hmm .
”
“ Beast of Burden in charge of the hostiles , the ex - cons , ex - birdcage , ex - covert military , ex - cage fighters .   
The ones who are good or even eager when it comes to hurting people .
”
Snag commented , “ We ’ve had conversations with a few of them already .   
Beast of Burden included .   
We ’re looking for people who are good or even eager to deliver the hurt .
”
“
Great .   
We ’ll keep that in mind .   
Final clique worth talking about
, you ’ve got Prancer in charge of the organization side of things .   
The diplomacy , recruitment , and a lot of the lower - key , ongoing business .
”
“
And ? ”
“
And I do n’t think we ’re going to divide up into factions and end up fighting each other .   
I say clique because like attracts like and sooner or later , you ’ll get pulled into one of the major groups .   
Each serving a role .
”
“
We ’re our own group , ” Snag said .   
“
We do n’t care what clique you belong to .   
You want access to our stuff to study and see what you can learn ?
”
“
We ’d have to talk about it among ourselves , but I think we ’re leaning that way .
”
I looked at the phone , as the Speedrunners exchanged looks .
“
Yeah , ” Secondhand said , after assessing the others .   
“
Let ’s assume we ’re good to go forward with this , but we wo n’t set anything in stone until my friends
and I have had a conversation .
“
Preliminary offer : we pay you fifteen thousand dollars , and we give you access to our tech for study , ” Snag said .   
“
You give us access to your tech , and you lend us a hand when the time comes .
”
“ For this job you ’re planning ?
”
“ If you want to discuss it , I can invite others who ’ve pledged to help .   
We ’ll discuss in one of Prancer ’s venues .
”
“
Maybe .   
We ’d have to talk it over .   
What timeline ?
”
“ Soon , ” Snag said .   
“
Anything more should wait for the discussion .
”
“ How difficult ?
”
“
Hard to say .   
I do n’t want to tell you something and have it reach the wrong ears , and there are a lot of wrong ears .
”
“ Give us some idea .
”
“ Eight or nine young people with powers , is our best guess .   
Mostly teenagers .   
We do n’t know who else , or what the exact number of adult capes , allies , or other resources they might have .   
Teenagers are easiest to track , because they move more .
”
Someone spoke , and I had to view my phone to check who it was .   
Last Minute .   
“
Hard to say ?   
That sounds easy to say .   
A minimum of eight or nine people with powers is difficult .
”
“
With the recruitment we ’re planning , we ’ll outnumber them three to one , ” Snag said , in his characteristic growl .
“
You ’re talking people with powers ?   
Not mooks , not henchmen ?
”
“
People with powers .   
All going well , we ’ll have them outnumbered three to one even if they call in help .
”
“ Pulled from Cedar Point ?
”
“ Pulled from many places .   
We have a thinker contact and that contact is calling in friends .   
This contact and their friends are capes with names you ’ve heard of , that everyone has heard of .   
We have Lord of Loss committed to the job .   
We have one or two others of similar caliber who may or may not participate , but who will contribute meaningful resources if they do n’t show up personally .
”
“ You do n’t do things by half measures ,
” Secondhand said .
“ We do n’t believe in half measures , ” Snag said .   
“
In the bigger job , or in our deal with you .   
Tech for tech , fifteen thousand for the job , but I ’d like the two things bundled together .   
We establish a working relationship and even a mutual dependency before the job starts .
”
“ Mutual dependency ?
”
“ A reason for people to second guess themselves before wondering if they can drop away at the last minute and they wo n’t be missed because the crowd is big enough .   
It was known to happen at events like Endbringer fights , before Gold Morning .
”
“
Speaking for myself , not having consulted the group …
”
“
Of course .
”
“
I do n’t mind that approach .   
We ’d have to discuss the money .   
Spread across a four person team , it does n’t amount to that much .
”
“ When I did the community center job … ” Snag started .   
He paused , letting the statement hang .
“
You did it with stipulations and expectations .   
Stipulations handled , expectations met , ”
Secondhand said .   
“
We ’re aware .
”
“
That counts for something , ”
Last Minute said .   
“
It needed doing , and it was done well .
”
“ Trust that we intend to do this well , ” Snag said .   
“
The three of us have spent a year steadily working toward this .   
If you want more money , we could discuss it .   
We ’d want references to justify it , a guarantee you ’ll earn your keep .
”
“ I think we could manage that .   
Instead of money , though … ”
“ Hmm ?
”
“ Cradle .   
He ’s your best tinker ?
”
“ He can be .
”
“ Maybe you sweeten the pot .   
Include his work .
”
“ That can be arranged .   
You give us your references and recommendations in exchange .
”
“
Alright .   
I like the sound of that .   
We ’ll talk .
”
“
Good , ” Snag said .
Secondhand put out a hand .   
Snag reached out with his giant mechanical hand , enclosing it around Secondhand
’s hand and forearm .
They all shook hands .   
Snag ’s giant mechanical hand made for a peculiar image as it met Final Hour ’s hair - dryer stub of a limb and the two shook .
When steampunk - ish End of Days gingerly took Love
Lost
’s clawed hand in his bare hand , he bent down , kissing the back of it .   
With her back to the camera , it was impossible to see her reaction .
The Speedrunners split up into two groups , two getting into an older car , and two getting into the van with the tech in the back .
Snag and Love Lost walked back the way they came .   
Love Lost turned her head to watch as the cars pulled out of the parking lot and then drove past the pair of them .   
The camera that was perched on the edge of the building slowly turned to follow the pair .
As the camera zoomed in , the sound clarifying , the metal noises of Snag ’s hands periodically touching the road and Love Lost
’s claws clicking were very audible .
Kenzie must have changed something , because the sound faded into the background .
“
Good ?
” Snag asked .
Love Lost gave him a singular nod .
“
They ’re good to have .   
Versatile , and it ’s good to have that tech .   
I can think of ten things I could do with that .
”
Another nod .
“
You ’re good for the meeting at the pub ?
”
A final nod .
“ Pub , ” I heard Tristan say .   
“ Kenzie ?   
Do we deploy Victoria ?
”
“ I have an address .   
Only pub in Cedar Point , I think .   
Across the street from where Prancer went inside .
”
I brought the phone up to my face .   
“ Love Lost might be able to sense people , and there ’s Birdbrain and Braindead to account for .
”
“
It ’s up to you , Victoria ,
” Tristan said .   
“
But it would really , really help if we could get more of this kind of exchange .
”
I stepped off the roof , realized that someone was standing on the sidewalk on the far side of the street , staring at me , and saw the alarm on their faces .   
I gave them my best heroic salute as I started flying instead of falling from the roof of the two - story building .
“
Ashley and Rain are kind of quiet , ” I said , to the phone .
“ I do n’t like phones , where I ca n’t see faces or reactions , ” Ashley said .   
“
I ’m fine .   
This is good .
”
“
I ’m not
so fine , ” Rain said .
Understandable .
Right .   
I ’d maybe talk to him after , or encourage him to reach out to Yamada .   
Even better , he could get around to making that call to the hero teams .
But for now , going into enemy territory , I needed to look after myself and the mission .   
I now needed to make prompt decisions for things that I ’d hoped I ’d have a few days or weeks to think about .
“ Radio silence unless it ’s an emergency , or you need to tell me to stop deploying the camera , Kenzie , ” I said .
I heard a faint ‘ boop’ .
No assistance , now .   
Just me and my intel .   
I put the white mask on .
Primary concerns :
Braindead and Birdbrain .   
Clairvoyants both .
Braindead was a tactical thinker , who could designate a set area in three dimensions , setting out a rectangular prism where he sensed everything in the area .   
He could cover a small town with his power and have a general awareness of everything that happened in that town , but if he designated a smaller area , he got more clarity , more attention of simultaneous things at once , and he was aware of stats .   
Non - numerical values for abstract things like physical wellness , martial combat capacity , and run speed , for everyone in the area .   
Smaller area , more and more accurate stats .
The drawback was that he was a twenty - something guy that spent an awful lot of time sitting in a chair with a diaper on , drooling , mumbling , and feeling acutely uncomfortable .   
When his power was active , and for a time after , he was unable to act on his knowledge himself , or even to effectively defend himself .   
He had been on the side of the good guys , once , which was why his power information was such common knowledge .   
Something had changed or snapped .
I flew just over the rooftops .   
It was n’t me flying at a height where I could pull my phone out , because there was a very real chance I could fly into something like a power line or chimney .
Braindead ’s power operated in three dimensions .   
X , Y , Z.    A set area of north , south , east , west , up , and down .   
If he wanted all of the stats and information , and if he wanted to minimize the other drawbacks of his power , like the recovery time , up and down were often the variable he could sacrifice .   
He could cover an area three city blocks wide along the west - east axis and three city blocks long along the north - south axis , while only covering six to ten feet of up and down .
Against Braindead alone , flying high and sticking to rooftops was a really safe bet , to stay out of his realm of awareness .
Against Birdbrain , that was a weakness .   
Birdbrain was a tactical clairvoyant of a complementary stripe to Braindead .   
Top - down clairvoyant awareness , much like if Kenzie operated solely through tinker eyes - in - the - sky pointed straight down .   
She also had thinker powers of another sort , worked into the main clairvoyant power , but she was n’t an ex - hero , and the information was n’t in files .
She was really good with a gun , highly mobile , and thus she was very good at defending Braindead while he was incapacitated .
If I stuck to rooftops , Birdbrain would detect me quickly .   
If I went to the ground , I ’d be in Braindead ’s realm .
I flew under things when I could , just to try to throw Birdbrain for a loop .   
It took me a second to orient myself and find the buildings I was looking for , even when I knew they were part of the downtown strip .
No sign of Snag or Love Lost .   
They were already inside , I hoped .   
With luck , I would be able to get the camera online shortly .
I set down on the roof , my forcefield down , and put my bag down in the corner of the roof , against the raised lip .
Fully aware that it was very likely that an eye in the sky was watching my every move , I used my body to block the view of the bag ’s contents , and pulled the camera out , placing it against the corner , where the bag would shield it .   
I got my notebook out , opened it to an empty page , and put it across the corner of the roof , before pulling out the chips and what turned out to be curry in a pita wrap .
Curry in a pita was not a mix I ’d run into before , but I was n’t going to complain .   
I put the wrap on my notebook , weighing it down , and the chips by my bag , against the ledge of the roof .
My backpack shielded most of the camera from view , the notebook ’s placement shielded any view of it from above .
I had to take it slow .   
I sat on the roof , leaning against the ledge , opened the bag , and adjusted the plunger .   
I reached into the bag , and discovered they were n’t chips , but a salted pork rind thing .
Urg .
I ate a few , penned down some general observations of the neighborhood , and then adjusted the plunger slightly downward , as part of the process of reaching down to fish for another mouthful of overly - salted pork things .
It took maybe a minute and a half to two minutes , because of the regular pauses here and there .   
I heard the ‘ boop’ through my phone , took that as my signal , and pulled my phone out to cancel the call , being sure to keep it at an angle where someone watching from above me could n’t see the phone ’s face or display .
I was nervous , remaining where I was .   
Every moment I was here , I was guarding the camera , the camera was presumably filming , and we were getting information .
Every moment I was here , I was being watched .   
My forcefield was down , because having it up risked it damaging the roof , building , or the camera .   
The locals were getting time to figure out what to do with me .
We wanted to stir the hornet ’s nest , to keep it stirred to exhaust resources and keep them from being particularly effective villains .   
Those same hornets could sting .
I ate some of Chris’ curry in a pita , just to look like I was on a typical stakeout or patrol , and I wished I ’d brought a drink .   
I took notes , with an eye to graffiti and symbols , to names and sayings .   
Things I could look up later , to see if I could divine any other names or personalities that had settled in Cedar Point .
It was maybe five minutes in total before they decided they were uncomfortable with me being where I was .   
Across the street , a big guy in costume emerged .   
Blond haired , a metal mask with fur on it , and a combination of metal and what looked like horn or natural armor plates on a brown costume .   
His gauntlets looked menacing , with fur , metal , and studs .
He looked pretty B - list , all in all .
He beckoned for me to come .   
I wondered if I should gather my bag .
I decided to take a risk , leaving it where it was .   
I flew down to the street below .
“
I ’m
Moose , ” he said .   
“
You ’re unwelcome .
”
“
The last time I came , you guys called Tattletale .   
She told me to get lost .
”
“
Yup , ” Moose said .
“ To me , hearing that , I ’m inclined to think I should show up more , ” I said .
“ Ahh , nope , ” he said .   
“
No , I think you ’ve got the wrong inclination there , Glory Girl .
” I shrugged .   
“
What can you do , Moose ?
”
“ What I ’m going to do , Glory Girl , is I ’m going to tell you how this is going to go down .
”
“
Do tell , ” I said .
“
Two brutes , like you and me , heavy hitters , we ’re liable to have a brawl .   
I ’ll avoid breaking anything breakable because I have an investment in Hollow Point here .   
You ’ll avoid breaking stuff because you ’re one of the good guys .   
You do n’t want that bad PR .
”
“ Makes sense , ” I said .
“ We ’ll have a really polite knock - down brawl , as such things go , and you ’ll trounce me .
”
“ I ’ll trounce you ?
”
“
I said I ’d tell you how this was going to go , and I ’m pretty sure that ’s how it ’s going to go .
”
“ Thinker power ?
” I asked .
“
Only thinker power I got is decently good common sense , ” Moose said .
I nodded .
“
So you ’ll trounce me .   
Thoroughly .   
You ’ll embarrass me , even .   
Not because you ’re a girl
and I ’m a guy , but because you ’re strong and you have more experience , and because fighting someone who flies is a massive bother .
”
“ You could surrender .
”
“ Ca n’t .   
Invested in this place .   
But there ’s more to it , Glory Girl .
”
“
Not my name anymore , by the way .
”
“
Oh , really ?   
Sorry about that .
”
“ I do n’t have another to give you , not yet , but I thought I ’d let you know .
”
“ If you ’re going to stay , I got ta fight you
and I got ta get trounced .
”
“
That ’s a shame , ” I said .
“
But there ’s more to it .   
I ’m pulling from that common sense , now .   
You ’ll trounce me , I ’ll be embarrassed , and in the time it takes for that to happen , others are going to show up .   
They wo n’t interfere , but they ’ll stand around and they ’ll be ready to fight you if you ’re insistent on staying .   
You ’ll be outnumbered and they wo n’t be inclined to play fair , except that they ’ll let you leave if you ’re willing to leave .
”
“
Which I will .
”
“ Good to hear .   
Except … can we just skip straight to the part where you leave ?   
I do n’t want to be embarrassed and you do n’t want to run scared from a group of menacing looking capes .
”
“
I ’m supposed to run scared from you instead , Moose ?
”
“
You can knock me around as you make your exit , if you ’d like .
”
“
Really ?
”
I asked , a little incredulous .
He shrugged .
“
This is n’t a trap ?
”
“ Nope .
”
I used my flight , and rose up off the ground .   
He did n’t react .
I flew at him , forcefield up , fist out .
He met my fist with his , moving faster than I ’d expected .   
The shockwave from the impact knocked me back and up into the air .   
I righted myself and hovered on the spot , ten or so feet off the ground .
The shockwave was weird .   
Intense , and focused .   
There was more to that Brute power .
“ I ca n’t embarrass myself too badly , ” he said .   
“
There ’s an audience .
” I looked .
In the window of the pub , Snag had risen to his feet .   
Love Lost was sitting , still , watching through the window .   
There were a handful of others .
I met Snag ’s eyes momentarily , and tried to look a little surprised .
Then I flew at Moose again .   
I pushed out with my aura .
His reaction to the fear and awe was to strike out , a solid punch , not a reckless one like most would throw reactively .   
I did n’t follow the awe with an attack , and I was glad I had n’t , because the chances were good that I would ’ve been hit .
Instead , I used his momentary bewilderment to fly over his head , because it was easy to do , it required him to turn around .   
Better yet , it involved a lot of readjustment of footing and balance , at the same time he was recovering from the emotional hit .
Watching , waiting , feeling more like the warrior monk as I used this approach , I tried to identify the time his footing was still off , his awareness of me imperfect , and I dove , striking him with one foot in the collarbone .
In the process , the wretch decided to strike out too .   
It hit him across the face , knocking the mask off .   
I saw blood , and the tracks of fingernails .
He fell , and he sat there , his head turned away from me , one gauntlet - covered hand moving to his face .
“
You okay ?
”
I asked , flying up and looking away .   
I did n’t want to be accused of peering beneath the mask .
“
I ’ll mend , ” he said .
I did n’t wait , and I did n’t look back .   
Back to my notebook , to my bag and book and Chris’ meal .   
I packed it up , collecting the camera .
When I ’d crossed the water and reached the edge of the neighborhood where the hideout was , I called the others .
“
Thanks for that , Victoria , ” Sveta said .
“ How ’d we do ?
”
“ We did n’t get the very start and we did n’t get what would ’ve been the end , but we got some , and I think everyone ’s happy with that , ” she said .   
“
You okay ?
”
“
I ’m
alright .
”
“
Come back .   
We ’ll talk , and you can see what we got .
” I flew back .   
I did n’t fly in a straight line , being mindful of any possible pursuers , and I flew lower to the ground as I drew closer to the building where the place we were renting was .   
I landed at the edge of the lot and walked to the fire escape .
Ashley , Sveta , Kenzie and Chris were all present .   
They were watching a distorted and monochrome image of the inside of the pub , projected on the wall .
I noted the absence of Tristan and Rain .
“
He ran , ” Ashley said , her voice low .
“ Rain ?
”
“ He got spooked , ” she said .   
“ Tristan went after him .
”
“
To reassure , ” Sveta said .
Chris reached past Kenzie to hit keys on the keyboard .   
The image on the projector screen changed .
“
You suck at that , ” Kenzie said , elbowing him .   
“
Here .
”
The image was distorted , as if viewing something underwater , with a film of grime on the lens .   
The sound , however , was only slightly muted .
“
You really want this kid to suffer .
”
“ We want him to face a fate worse than death , ” Snag said .   
“
But we ca n’t have that and have him dead at the same time , and we need him dead .   
If he suffers as much as possible along the way to that conclusion , we ’ll be satisfied .
”
“ If you ’re paying , we can satisf-
”
The message cut off as Kenzie hit a key .   
She looked back at me , shooting me what might ’ve been an attempt at a reassuring smile .   
Not so reassuring .








I was being watched .
I was being watched at a time when Rain was gone , hiding , when Tattletale was in play .   
We had enemies , I ’d drawn attention .   
These things , though , were n’t at the forefront of my attention .   
It said a lot that they were n’t .
The slash on Moose ’s face lingered in my mind ’s eye , when I was n’t careful about where that eye was turned .
The train was noisy as it rolled along the tracks .   
With the longer train journeys , I was primed to expect that the urban would give way to the rural or the buildings on either side would stop .   
It did n’t .   
Like a car driving down the highway at night , the streetlights reaching into the vehicle interior and then dropping away , the sun ’s
light did much the same when it reached in at a low angle , extending between buildings to light up the dark train car .
It was just late enough in the morning that most students had made their way to school , but the students with classes in the afternoon block that had stopped in to check in or change were now leaving the schools .   
They were heading off to work , to do light construction work , for academic clubs , study halls and to join the patrol block , and many were dressed accordingly .    
They looked so young .
The train car was packed , and I was glad I ’d managed to get a seat , even though it was one of the narrow , tiny ones by the door that flipped up to be flush with the wall , when a wheelchair or baby carriage needed the room .
I ’d first noticed the person watching me because her face had a lot of freckles , and out of the corner of my eye , I ’d thought she was someone else .   
On closer look , though , I could see that her hair was jaw length and straighter , her facial structure was different , and she was wearing the clothes of a student athlete , with bare shoulders and arms , gym shorts , and a towel around her neck .
I might have dismissed her then , but she ’d been looking at me , looking away when I glanced her way .   
I found myself looking again a few moments later , because one look was n’t enough to dismiss the unease I felt in response to a freckle - covered face looming in my peripheral vision , peering past the crowd .   
The same thing happened the second time I looked at her .   
I caught her staring , and she looked away .
There had been a time that I would have automatically assumed it was positive .   
I was recognizable , I ’d been a hometown celebrity in a town with a fair number of prominent people , and that had led to me getting recognized by at least one person each time I went out .   
I ’d reveled in it .
Now ?   
Traitorous instincts made that the second or even the third rank option in a list .   
The first thought in my head on realizing I was being stared at was to go straight to the hospital room , to people staring at wretched me in a vain effort to try to comprehend what they were looking at .   
They wondered how I even functioned , how I worked , tried to understand the configuration .   
When I moved automatically , the movements caught the eye .
Even with the most polite and iron - willed of them , they struggled to find which eye or eyes they should look at to make and maintain eye contact , and in the search for that common , natural thing , they ended up staring at the rest of me .
At the rest of the wretch , the sideshow freak , the monster .
How had Byron put it , at the meeting with Foresight ?   
Tristan was nourished by the hardheaded struggle .   
Byron was recharged by periods of rest .   
It gave Tristan a natural advantage in their endless struggle over a single body .
I was closer to Byron in that .   
I was recharged by attention , by adulation , encouragement , worship .   
It was a natural progression of the fact that I ’d been built to be a hero , because I could put on a costume and do great things and get that attention and encouragement .
Had I done things in a different way , it could have even been constructive and healthy .   
But I ’d been a stupid kid .   
Arrogant .   
A little worship was good .   
I ’d worshiped Dean .   
He ’d worshiped me .   
On a level , I ’d reached for the wrong things in places , prioritized certain things over others in how I handled the adulation and the public .   
There were a lot of things I wished I ’d done differently .
That was n’t even the biggest part of why , much like Byron , I could n’t go to my most natural ways of finding recharge .   
Like how mental illness obscured the ability of the person in question to even see the problem at hand , my capacity to recover was distorted and damaged .   
Tainted .
Tristan had remarked on it too , now that I thought about it .   
Needing people .   
He wanted to party , to abandon restraint .   
I wanted …
I supposed I wanted not to illogically , automatically , inevitably think of the wretched thing that had occupied that hospital room , anytime someone paid particular attention to me .
I wanted to not feel a deep sadness sinking in when I caught someone staring .
In the places my head went , the wretch loomed in first place , the hero celebrity in second .   
The third place possibility was that this girl looking at me was something nefarious , and that the young , freckle - faced athlete was an agent of Tattletale or a hire from Cedar Point .   
Not impossible , but not likely .
Then the fourth place possibility , that she thought I was attractive , not impossible .   
The fifth place possibility that I had a piece of my breakfast stuck to my cheek or something in my hair .   
The sixth place possibility , that she was staring off into space
and I was somehow always in the way …
My thoughts were mired in something so minor , my heart ached indistinctly , and I was just making myself anxious and upset .
I checked my phone .   
I could focus on the job .   
The mission at hand .

I know I said I would n’t send you any more messages
but I forgot I had these scans on my phone :

If they ’d been texts I would have been alerted with each one , but I had n’t , and they ’d accumulated .   
I was prepared to continue browsing , wrapping my head around reading through the emails in reverse order , but the train slowed , brakes squealing .
The signs above the exits changed .   
Car 3 : Blackrock Station .
Students departed , then more entered , but the end result was that things were far less crowded .   
I got a look at the girl who was staring at me , and she glanced away , reflexively .
As people exited , seats here and there were freed up .   
There was a bit of a shuffle as people hurried to claim seats .   
A sixteen - ish year old boy claimed the vacated seat next to me .
In that same moment , though , Ashley moved between train cars , entering mine , spotted me , and approached .
She wore sunglasses and the black dress she ’d picked up at Cedar Point .   
Strapless , with sheer black fabric enveloping the shoulders and arms , decorated with a lace - like pattern of feathers .   
The sleeves disappeared into fingerless black gloves .   
Her little black shoes looked like dancer ’s shoes , which fit with the dress she wore .
I raised my hand in a little wave .
“
I thought you ’d be around , ” she said , lifting her sunglasses .
“
I messaged you when I boarded , ” I said , touching my phone .   
I saw her expression change .   
“
And you do n’t like phones .
”
The seat I was sitting in was positioned such that the backs of the actual booth seats were to me .   
Ashley leaned against the back of one of the other seats , facing me , and the boy just beside me lifted his bag from his lap and used the room she ’d given him to vacate the seat .
“
Do you want my seat ?
”
I asked him .
He glanced back , looked at me , looked at Ashley , then shook his head .   
He nearly lost his balance as the train resumed moving .
Ashley took the seat , pulling it down from the side of the train and then sitting on it , crossing one knee over the other and placing her hands on top .   
Posed , in a very deliberate , conscious way .   
Even the angle of her head .
I looked past her to the freckled observer , who again looked away .   
Was it my frame of mind , sitting with Ashley , that made it so the wretch was n’t as close to the surface , the look not nearly as bothersome ?
Or was I overthinking it ?   
Was it that I ’d seen the look enough times and seen her reaction enough times that it did n’t feel so heavy , pressing , or potentially hostile ?   
Less about me and more about her , now .
“
He ’s sensible , ” Ashley said .   
“
He ’ll go far .
”
She might have thought I was looking at the boy who ’d run .
“
Did you take off your sunglasses just to intimidate him into giving up his seat ?
” I asked .
She put her sunglasses back into place and gave me a small smile .
“ You should n’t , ” I said .
“ Why not ?   
If there was a chance I ’d see him again , maybe I should n’t , but I wo n’t .   
The city is too big .
”
“ The little things ripple out .   
If you make a positive or negative impression , people mention them to others , those people mention them or carry them forward .   
You ’re not just interacting with him .   
You ’re interacting with everyone he ’s potentially going to interact with in the future .   
To lesser degrees , sure , but I absolutely think it matters .
”
“
What ’s he going to say ?   
I did n’t do anything , and he willingly gave up his seat .   
Is he going to tell all of his friends and family that he saw a lady with scary eyes and he ran away like a stray with its tail between its legs ?
”
“ I think it matters , ” I said .
“ I wanted to learn from you all .   
I ’ll have to take that sentiment and think on it-
”
“
Good , ” I said .
“ -because
you ’ve only given me sentiment .   
Not one good argument yet .
”
I turned my head her way , frowning .   
She smiled a little more .
“
Let ’s say you entered the scene , you ’ve gathered all your info , you have a nice costume , you ’ve trained , you ’re badass , ” I said .
“
Mm , ” she made a sound .
“ You have your first big job .   
You make a splash , there ’s some media attention , video , something like that .   
It appears on TV briefly , but people talk online .   
They ’re the ones who create your online profile and fill in your info , they apply the labels , describe things , set the tone .   
What if the guy you scared off ends up being one of them , and he ends up sitting at his keyboard , remembering you as he decides what to write ?
”
“ I did n’t do a thing to him .
”
“
But did he leave with a good impression of you ?
” She shrugged .
“
What happens if this guy finds himself in that situation , ready to make a call about you or share his thoughts , and he describes his horrible encounter with you on the train , how you intimidated him and said odious things ?
”
“
I said nothing .
”
“
And he ’s a teenager , he ’s a guy , you ’re a girl , he ’ll think about this scene again , he might be bothered , and he ’ll want to resolve that feeling .   
Maybe he lies and badmouths you online .
”
Ashley looked like she was the very definition of unimpressed .
I shrugged .
“
I hate the internet , ” she said .   
“ Despise it .   
When I become a villain , I ’ll move out to a border world where the internet is n’t established and I ’ll take over .   
I ’ll rule as a queen , without any need to concern myself with teenagers who could lie about me without fear of reprisal .
”
“
Sounds like a plan , ” I said .   
It was my turn to shoot her a small smile .
“
Yes , yes , ” she said .   
She brought her head back , leaning it against the wall behind her .   
“
I ’ve been brought low , relying on sentiment over fact .   
How the tables have turned .
”
“
That was n’t actually what I was thinking , ” I said .
I did n’t get a chance to elaborate .   
The girl with freckles approached .   
She looked spooked , arms close to her body as she held a notebook , but the ‘ spook’ was aimed more at me .
Too petite to be the person I ’d worried I ’d seen out of the corner of my eye , earlier .   
Years younger – fourteen , if I had to guess .   
Timid , yes , fidgety , that was similar , but in other ways , she held herself differently .   
This girl dressed different , sporty and confident .
“
Hi , ” I said .
“
Are you-
you ’re Victoria Dallon .
”
“ I am .
”
“
I ’m a fan .   
I ’ve been a fan for years .
”
“
What ’s your name ?
”
“ Presley .
”
“ You know , Presley , I was just thinking about how I missed the days of living in Brockton Bay , when I ’d get to make connections with people .   
I missed that , and you might have just made my day .
”
Her smile was tentative at first and then solidified into something more confident .
“ I lived in Brockton Bay for a year when I was nine .   
My family was going through stuff .   
That does n’t really matter
but it ’s why I was there , and I saw this picture of you
and I loved it .   
I did n’t even know you were a real person or what your name was until a month later .   
I got a poster of the same picture for my birthday .
”
“
Which poster ?
”
“
Oh , it had a yellow background , and you were flying , and you had your arms out and behind you , like- ”
She took a bit of a pose , chest pushed up and out , arms back with fists clenched near her butt .   
Well , one fist .   
She held the notebook , still .
“
I know the one , ” I said .   
“
That was a magazine cover first , I think .
”
“ I have the magazine too .   
And a bunch of other things .   
Even after I moved to Portland
I did everything I could to collect each thing that came out .   
But the poster was important to me .
”
“
I ’m really glad , ” I said .
“
It was one of the first things I put on my wall every time we settled into a new place .   
Later , whenever I was feeling lost I ’d look at it .   
I got into sports because I read you were an athlete before you were a hero ,
except it ’s soccer , not basketball , because I ’m too short .
”
She looked disappointed as she said it .
“
You ’re in the athletics block , ” I said .   
“
They do n’t let just anyone in .   
I ’d bet you ’re better at soccer than I was at basketball .
”
“
No , ” she said , with an expression like that was impossible to fathom , even upsetting , eyes wide .
It seemed she needed me as an idol more than she needed me as a connection or someone she could relate to .
“ I got a lot of extra flack and attention from the enemy team because I came from a family of heroes and a lot of people knew my name , ” I said .   
“
Maybe that was why .
” Presley nodded very quickly .   
“
There ’s someone on my team who ’s really good , she gets something like that .   
I really look up to her too .
”
“
Are you going to keep hugging that notebook or are you going to hand it over for her to sign ?
”
Ashley asked .
Presley looked startled at that , afraid .   
She ’d been working her way up to it , and the issue had been forced .
“ Be nice , ” I said .
“
I ’m being nice , ” Ashley responded .   
“
The way this is going , this girl-
”
“
Her name is Presley , ” I interjected .
“
She ’s going to finish telling you how awesome you are , she wo n’t work up the nerve , and she ’ll kick herself for not getting the autograph .
”
I rolled my eyes slightly and turned to Presley .   
“
Do you want me to ?
”
“
Please , ” she breathed the word more than she said it .
I took the notebook and I took the pen .   
It had been a little while since I ’d done this .
“
When I looked at you in the poster I told myself that was everything I wanted to be , fearless and fair and strong and poised .   
Every time I entered a new part of my life or moved to a new place , I looked at it in different ways .
”
I wrote my message on the inside cover , listening while the pen scratched .
“ When we had to evacuate because of Gold Morning , we had to leave everything behind .
” I looked up .   
“
I ’m sorry .
”
“
But we went back , after everything calmed down .   
We went back to the house and it was mostly intact , except for broken windows and water damage .   
We could only bring what we could fit in the car , but I made sure to bring that .   
I wanted it with me for whatever comes next .
”
“ I can only encourage and inspire , and I ’m really glad if I ’ve helped with that .   
The strength , the fairness , the poise , though , that comes from you .   
Everything you ’ve triumphed over , surviving the bad days , getting to here , then doing well enough to be part of the athletics block , ” I said .   
I closed the book , the pen still between the pages .   
I passed it to her , and put my hands over hers as she took the book .   
I met her eyes .   
“
That ’s you .   
That ’s your power .   
Pretty much what I wrote , but
I wanted to say it too .
”
As I moved my hands away from hers , she smiled and hugged the book .
A moment later , she turned to Ashley .   
She lowered her voice , “ Do you have powers ?
” Ashley nodded .
“
Can you ?
”
Presley held out the notebook .
“
No , ” Ashley replied .
“
Okay , I ’m sorry ,
” Presley said , too quickly , too defensive in how she pulled her book back , how she held it .   
She looked at me .   
“ Thank you so much .
”
“
You ’re very welcome , ” I said .
But as I said it , Presley was already retreating , fleeing back to her spot by the doors , amid all the other students who were standing in the seatless area that would have bikes and prams in it at different stages of the journey .
I could have pressed , even taken issue with how Ashley had handled that .
Instead , I gathered my thoughts .   
On a level , I did feel refreshed .   
It had been a really nice moment , the minor issue at the end souring it slightly , but nice all the same .
I was having to get used to having the nice moments be routinely touched with those sour notes .
“ I ca n’t hold a pen , ” Ashley murmured .
I looked at her .
She moved her hands from where they rested on her knee .   
She turned one over , moved a finger .   
It trembled throughout the small movement .   
“
I ’ll have my appointment after we talk to Houndstooth , get tuned up .   
Until then , it hurts to move my hands
and I do n’t trust my power .   
That ’s why .
”
“ You could have explained .
”
She gave me a look .
“
You could have , ” I said .
The look was maintained .   
Even with the sunglasses she wore , the disdain was clear .   
“ Ripple effects , you said .   
I would n’t be revealing it to her alone .   
I ’d be risking revealing it to everyone she meets from here on out .
”
“
The good things have a way of rippling out with more strength than the bad things do , ” I said .
“
So you say , ” Ashley said , “ while riding on a train through a city in the post - apocalypse .   
Just one of many shattered , damaged worlds .
”
“
Cute .
”
The train slowed .   
Presley was at the door , joining the group that was ready to depart .
“ I ’d like to tell her , ” I said , my voice quiet .   
“
Even if we called it an injury , so you were n’t revealing something vital .
”
“ You really care about this .
”
“
Yes , ” I said .   
“
Do n’t you ?
”
“ I care , ” she said .   
“
I do n’t want to lie and look weak while you lie to look better .
” I tensed .
“
You ’re strong , yes , ” she said , her voice barely audible .   
She took off her sunglasses .   
“
Poised ?   
I think it ’s an act .   
An effective act , the kind that becomes reality after enough time .   
But not enough time has passed .   
Fair ?   
We ’ll see .   
But fearless ?
”
She made the smallest of scoffing sounds .   
The train came to a stop .
I started to respond , but there was a hollow feeling in my mouth and throat , where the words were supposed to be .   
I closed my mouth , then said , just as quiet , “
She needs that lie .
”
Ashley stared me down .
“
Frankly , ” I said , still quiet , angry now , “ you come across worse and smaller as a person when you say no to something that costs you nothing than you do by admitting you ’re disabled .
”
“ Temporarily disabled , ” she said .   
“
You ’re wrong .   
I ca n’t think of anything worse than groveling before a child and telling her I ’m weak when I ’m the very opposite .   
I could kill everyone on this train if it came down to it .   
One after the other .   
By the time I made my way to the next train car , they would be ready for me , and it would n’t matter .
”
I tensed as heads turned .   
They were n’t responding to the words .   
Only the emotion behind them .
Had I just provoked her into another rage on a relatively crowded train ?
Would my next words ?   
Would my silence ?   
Would leaving ?   
Staying ?
“
She does n’t know that it ’s only temporary , ” I said .   
“
She just thinks there ’s something wrong .   
With you or with her .
”
“
Let her , ” Ashley said .   
“
Do what you want , but do n’t make me regret telling you anything .
”
I looked over to the side .   
The people had departed the train , Presley included , and the ones boarding had mostly filed in .
“
It ’s too late anyway , ” Ashley said .   
“
Another face we ’ll never see again , that probably wo n’t make any ripples .
”
I stood from my seat .   
“
I ’ll be back .
”
“
Whatever .
”
Glancing back , making sure she was n’t about to go on a rampage as she had threatened , I ducked and pushed past the crowd , hurrying to the door .   
Tristan touched my shoulder as I passed him .
“
I ’ll be right back .   
Can you watch my bag ?
”
I said , turning to face him and walking backward as I said it .   
I pointed in Ashley ’s direction and mouthed ‘ and Ashley’ .
He gave me a short nod .
The doors closed behind me as I stepped onto the train platform .   
I took to the air .
Why was this so important to me ?
With a bird ’s eye view , I could search the crowd , looking for the right hair color , the right height , the clothes , freckle - covered shoulders , chin - length hair .
Was this ego ?
Was I just seeking out perverse , self - centered worship , after going without so long ?   
Tantalus finally getting a drink of water after centuries without ?   
A parasitic , sad wretch of a vampire like in those bad Maggie Holt movies , finally with a willing victim ?
I ’d found her
and I hesitated .
But the train was getting away from me .   
I had to act .
Instinct , rather than action .   
I was n’t thinking things through .   
I was n’t acting according to the mission I ’d planned and set out , was I ?
I landed , forward momentum becoming a brisk walk , then a slower one .   
I saw the surprise on her face .   
People nearby were startled .
“
Sorry , ” I said .   
“
I ’m in a rush .   
I do n’t suppose I could get your email ?
”
She looked around , possibly looking for Ashley , or at the crowd .
She still held her notebook , and she opened it , scribbling something down .   
She tore off the corner of the page , then handed it to me .
“ I ’ll send you something , ” I said .
She nodded , wordless .
I left the ground much as I ’d landed .   
The train was already pulling away .   
I flew after it .
Had I made a mistake , leaving Ashley , when she was riled up ?   
I had no idea how well she and Tristan got along .   
Were my perspectives straight ?
It was n’t even nine o’clock in the morning , and I was mired in a week ’s worth of doubts and second - guesses .   
That was n’t me .   
It was n’t supposed to be .
I checked my phone as I flew .
You have 52 unread emails .
I ’d had thirty nine or forty , after browsing the initial selection .
I was here for a reason .   
Kenzie was one .   
Ashley another .   
Tristan , Chris , even Sveta … and Rain in particular .   
Rain who was taking a day off from everything .
They needed help .   
That was the job , the mission .   
Given to me by someone I cared about , involving another someone I cared about and the team and place in the world
she so desperately wanted .
I could do that .   
But I did n’t want to do it at the expense of people like Presley .
The feelings and the ideas took on a different light when I framed things that way .
It played into how I carried myself , after I touched down on the back of the train , on the same kind of little platform at the rear that Rain had used to jump off .
It played into how I walked , how I organized my thoughts .
I could remember going home after my first official arrest .   
Bad guy beaten , caught , delivered to authorities .   
Everything official , with my mom attending .   
I ’d walked in the door , and my mother had told my dad that I ’d had two firsts .   
My first arrest , my first war wound- a cut to my forehead , already stitched up .   
She ’d used her fingers to move my hair , to show my dad .
He ’d looked very tired as he bent down , kissed the top of my head .
He ’d offered me cookies and milk
and I ’d rolled my eyes , even though I ’d really wanted the cookies .
I was n’t sure at all about why or if the cookies played into things , but I did remember how I ’d stood straighter , how I ’d felt taller , more focused .
That was the feeling I wanted to capture , as I walked down the train car , entered the next , walked down that train car , and then entered the car I ’d been in before going after my fan .
Tristan was in my seat , talking to Ashley .   
Ashley was tense .   
She did n’t look as if she ’d calmed down in my absence .
Tristan wore a black jacket over a red t - shirt in a material that looked like it was meant to have sweat wick off of it .   
He ’d painted his hair again and the color reached to the roots .
He moved over from the seat as I approached , leaving the one between him and Ashley empty .   
Ashley did n’t move , her eyes hidden by the sunglasses she wore .   
A thin beam of light swept through the length of the train car .   
Not as pronounced an effect as it had been earlier , with the train slightly lower to the ground , the train at a different angle .
“ I ’ve come to believe you ’re more deluded than the rest of us , ” Ashley said , as I took the seat .   
“
Thinking any of that matters .
”
“ Maybe , ” I said .   
I fiddled with my phone , typing in the email .
“
Did you tell her ?
” she asked .
“
No , ” I said .   
“
I got her email , and I flew after the train .   
Hi Tristan .
”
“
From what I gather , you have a fan , and you and Ashley had a disagreement , ” Tristan said .
“
Yeah , ” I said , still typing .   
“
Any word on Rain ?
”
“ Scared as shit but safe .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
Is he going to be okay ?
”
“
No idea .   
But if they go after him , we ’re not in a position to do anything .   
I ’d like to ask Houndstooth for advice , see what resources we can tap .
” I nodded .
I paged through the phone , the email entered , and found myself at the home screen for the mail .
You have 55 unread emails .
I checked nobody was in earshot .   
There were people in the chairs just beside Tristan ’s seat , but they had headphones on .   
I figured we were pretty safe .
“
Kenzie might be melting down , ” I said .   
“ Or something .   
I do n’t know how to interpret this .
”
I showed Ashley .   
I went to show Tristan , and he was already pulling his phone out of his pocket .
He showed me his .
26 unread emails
“
She likes you more , ” he said .
“
I told her I do n’t use my phone .   
She was bothered at first , but she accepted it , ” Ashley said .   
“
Now I ’m glad .
”
“
What is this ?
” I asked .   
“
There ’s a part of me that ’s weirdly glad for the stream - of - consciousness insight into who she is and how she thinks , even if this is n’t good , but … this is n’t good .   
It ’s not healthy .
”
“ It is n’t , ” Tristan said .   
“
But it could be worse .   
If anything , it ’s a good prelude or warm - up for our discussion with Houndstooth .   
We ’ll talk with him , we ’ll send Kenzie a message , if she has n’t had her phone confiscated , and we ’ll see how things go from there .
”
“
If you ’re sure .
”
“
I ’m not sure of anything , ” he said .   
“
But we all have our weaknesses , and Kenzie ’s wrestling with hers .   
We ’ll figure it out .
” I nodded .   
I took my seat between the two .   
“
Can I ask you two a favor ?
”
“
What favor ?
” Tristan asked .
“ Why not ? ”
Ashley asked .   
“
I made the mistake of going along with an errand with the two most stubborn people I know .   
I deserve whatever I ’m subjected to .
”
“ Could be we ’re the two most stubborn members of the group , ” I said .   
I found myself reaching for that part of me that stood taller , that focused on the mission and the role .   
“
But we ’re the three most style - conscious people in this whole exercise .   
We might be missing Kenzie in that .   
Three of the four most style conscious .
”
“ I would n’t say Kenzie ’s style - conscious , ” Tristan said .   
“
But that ’s a conversation for another day .   
What ’s this about style ?
”
“ I want to take a picture .   
Lean in close , ” I said .   
“ Please .
”
Ashley gave me a look .
“ Please , ” I said .   
“
And since you do n’t have masks , you can use my hand , Ashley .   
Tristan , cover up a bit with your hand .   
Look photogenic .
”
“ I ’ve only had my photo taken twice , ” Ashley said .   
“
They were basically mugshots .
”
“
Did you look good for the mugshots ?
”
“
Of course .
”
“ Then look good for this .   
Come on .   
This could be your equivalent to a poster .   
She thought you were cool enough to ask for an autograph , let ’s give her a good picture .
”
“ Okay , ” Ashley said .
The two leaned in close ,
my hand in front of Ashley ’s eyes , fingers parted in the middle to reveal one of her eyes .   
Tristan used one hand , positioning himself so his hair would n’t be in the camera ’s frame .
I winked and hit the button to take the picture .
“ None of this matters , ” Ashley said .
I applied a caption to the picture .
Thanks for coming and saying hi .   
Picture just for you– keep an eye out for us in the future .
I showed the others the picture and caption .   
I got an okay from both , and sent it .
I held the phone where everyone could see it .   
With the first excited response , half of Ashley ’s tension seemed to dissipate .   
With the second and third , she smiled .
Doing this , helping , functioning in my role , I felt less like a vampire .   
Less like I was serving myself , because the feelings were set aside to where they were secondary .
It felt like a good warrior monk frame of mind for my discussion with Houndstooth .
⊙ We had to walk a little ways to get to where Houndstooth waited .   
He was in costume , and his appearance at the station would have risked a disruption .
All through the short walk across Greenwich , there were signs of the protests and strikes .   
Crude posters had been put up , with slogans and rallies to the cause .
It was too early in the day for a real protest , though .   
Just groups on street corners , some scattered people making a mess and some cleaning up .   
Stasis .
Houndstooth waited on a hill overlooking the city sprawl .   
He looked as he had in Kenzie ’s projected image .   
Anubis writ Western , with a shorter , blunter snout and a costume of mixed panels that straddled the line between being a bodysuit and being armor .
“
Thank you for making the time , ” Tristan said .   
He shook Houndstooth
’s hand .
“
It was my request , ” Houndstooth said .
“
Hi , ” I said , as he shook my hand .
“
Thank you for coming , Victoria .
”
He turned to Ashley .   
She stood with her hands clasped behind her .
“
It ’s nice to meet you , ” she said .
“
It ’s nice to meet you as well , ” he said , taking the lack of a handshake in stride .
The conversation hung there .
“
This is hard , ” he said .
“
We appreciate you helping out with Cedar Point , ” Tristan said .
“ We can open by talking about that , ” Houndstooth said .   
“ You ’ve visited ?
”
“
Yes , ” I said .   
“ Two of us .   
One of us more covert .
”
His snout moved more in Ashley ’s direction , then he nodded .   
“ How bad is it , once you ’re there ?
”
I answered , “ Protection racket in full swing .   
Villains moved in en masse .   
People moved away when they could .   
Those that could n’t are paralyzed now , helping to maintain the very thin veneer of normalcy while paying what little they can to the villains in control .   
Prancer and Velvet are some of the most prominent drug distributors right now
and they ’re in charge , so it ’s likely serving as a hub for that .
”
“
Some very violent capes are active there , ” Tristan said .   
“
A few of them we have a tenuous relationship with seem to be gathering soldiers with an intent to go to war .   
It looks like that might include us , but we do n’t know one hundred percent what they ’re up to .
”
“ As expected , then , ” Houndstooth said .
Ashley said , “ They have rooms to rent , but they cornered that market .   
They ’re welcoming newcomers , but only capes , only ones who will help them out .   
The businesses are struggling or closed , and nobody outside of Cedar Point is moronic enough to buy in .   
Cancer at the roots , the tree will die .
”
Houndstooth said , “ I remember back on Bet , we had a system we used for the areas where the good guys could n’t win , or where things were too bad to recover .   
It was mostly small towns .   
Evacuating , shutting off all power and water from the outside , closing down and blockading the roads , making living there as difficult as possible , perimeter blockades , regular raids , visits from big name capes .   
There was serious consideration given to giving Brockton Bay that H.O.S.V. designation .
” I had to assume his attention was on me as he said that last bit .
“
They said no in the end , ” I said .
“
What ’s your feeling on that ?
”
“ I think I would have made peace with it if they ’d said yes , ” I said .   
“
It would n’t be what it is now .
”
“
It ’s a pretty mixed thing right now .
”
“ It is , ” I said .   
“
I do n’t think there ’s a right or wrong answer .   
As it is , it has its positives , it ’s meant a lot to some people that it recovered as much as it did , it was a huge part of us rebuilding after the end .   
But I ’m not at peace with it either .
”
“
What happens to Cedar Point in the end , then ?
”
“ We weaken their hold , we leave room for more established parties to settle in and act as a counterbalance , instead of things all going the wrong way .   
You mentioned Brockton Bay .   
We saw what happened when the scale tipped too far one way .   
Too many heroes out of the picture , myself included , not enough coming in .
”
“ If we uncover anything particularly bad , and we might have already found something bad , we ’ll strike at them as we make our big play , ” Ashley said .
Tristan and I looked at her .
She added , “ With the help of other groups and forces .
”
“
We can be one of those other forces , ” Houndstooth said .   
“ Kings of the Hill are n’t big or strong , but we ’ve got our territory and we ’re helping to keep the peace .   
In exchange , we could use help when it comes to tackling some of the other problems .   
Ideally , it would be you three .   
Not …
”
“ Kenzie ?
” Tristan asked .
“
I ’d prefer to say kids , ” Houndstooth said .
“ You ’re going to have to get around to talking about her , ” Ashley said .   
“
You ca n’t dodge the subject forever .   
I ’ll get irritated and walk away if you try .
”
He folded his arms , walking over a little .   
The hill had several trees on it , and his armor panels glinted here and there as dappled light touched it .
“
You said this was hard , ” I said .
“
Did she touch any of you before you came here ?
” Houndstooth asked .
“
She went to school this morning .   
We came here , ” Tristan said .
“
I suspected that would be the way it went .   
It ’s why I wanted to meet when she was in school .   
Minimizes the chances .
”
“ Why does it matter ?
” I asked .   
“
We ’re bugged ?
”
“ Trackers , cameras , microphones , or-
” he paused , and his mask meant that if he was making an expression or trying to convey something with the pause , it was more or less lost .   
“ -Sound cameras .
”
“
She ’s a lot better than she was when you knew her , ” Tristan said .
“
That ’s great , ” Houndstooth said .   
“
I really do want things to work out for her .   
It ’s just hard .   
I need to protect myself , my old teammates .   
I want to protect you .   
I want people in general to be safe .   
All that aside , again , I do want positive outcomes for her .
”
“
But ?
” I asked .
“
But the Kenzie I know did n’t allow for that , ” Houndstooth said .   
“
So I had to prepare for this meeting , trying to figure out what to say and how to frame things while not hurting anyone .
”
“ She ’s been in therapy for a little while , ” Tristan said .   
“
She ’s improved by leaps and bounds from even the first time I met her .   
I really want to reinforce that .
”
“ I hear you , ” Houndstooth said .   
“
I ’m just worried you ’re not going to listen , and if that ’s the case , then it ’s a bad replay of me , our Protectorate leader and our PRT liaison talking to her school .   
It ’s a replay of us having a meeting with her new foster parents .   
It ’s a repeat of us talking to the parents of a new friend she ’s made .
”
“
What happened ?
” I asked .
“
We explained , they heard us , but they did n’t listen .   
They did n’t take it to heart , because she is- was nine .   
She ’s cute , she ’s precocious , and she has a really skewed skillset where she ’s really good at getting close to people
and she ’s really , tragically bad at staying there .   
Messes follow .
”
“
She ’s moving in a more measured way as she relates to the people around her now , ” Tristan said .   
“
She ’s more easygoing .   
And so far , staying close ?   
She ’s doing okay .   
Fingers crossed .
”
Houndstooth ’s hand moved , thumb tapping against the side of his finger , and it looked like he was going to say something .
“
Capricorn , was it ?
”
“ Or Tristan .
”
“ Tristan .   
I hear you .   
I ’m listening .   
She ’s in therapy , she ’s better .   
She ’s made strides .   
If you had to give her a number , how much better is she ?   
Throw a number at me .   
Eighty percent ?
”
“ Ninety five , ” Tristan said .
“ Ninety , ” Ashley said .
“
Okay , ” Houndstooth said .   
“
Five or ten percent of what I saw ?   
Still pretty fucking bad .   
I ’d like to give you some advice and double check some things .   
As the person who ’s been there and crossed his fingers before .
”
“
That ’s not fair ,
you’re-
” Tristan said .
“ Tristan , ” I said , cutting him off .
I was focused on Houndstooth .   
I was pretty sure I ’d beaten him by a hair in responding .
“
I asked you to have this chat as my side of our mutual agreement , ” Houndstooth said .   
“
I ’m
asking you to let me convey this to you .   
A lot of it is pretty mild .   
Give me a chance to say my piece , and you decide what to do with the knowledge .
”
I glanced at Tristan .
“
I ’ll shut up , ” he said .   
“ Sorry .
”
“
I ’m here to listen , ” Ashley said .   
“
Then I ’ll say my piece .
”
She had a piece to say ?   
I had n’t known this when she ’d invited herself along as one of the group ’s ‘ leaders’ .
“
Please , ” I said , to Houndstooth .
“ I ’ll give you some of the same advice my bosses gave to us and the people who interacted with Kenzie .   
Minimize the homework she does .   
That includes work - homework .   
Cape homework , if you want to call it that .
”
“
Why ?
” I asked .
“
Because she ’s so eager to please she ’ll hurt herself in the process .   
She had an art project in fourth grade , it was supposed to be done over the course of a month , following the instructions from regular handouts the teacher gave .   
Eight or ten handouts , I think it was .   
She asked kids a grade older than her what they ’d done for the same project , and she pulled two consecutive all - nighters to do it .   
Her foster parents did n’t even realize she was doing it , because it turns out a surveillance - countersurveillance tinker is really good at sneaking out to the garage and being quiet .
”
“
Surveillance - countersurveillance , ” I said .
“
She went that far because she wanted to wow her teacher and see the expressions on their face , ”
Houndstooth said .
“
It was n’t good , ” Tristan said .   
“ Their reactions .
”
“ Shocked , almost horrified , ” Houndstooth said .   
“
And Kenzie was devastated to the point of being broken when it did n’t get the reaction she wanted it to .   
She was so stressed out over it in the days after that that she threw up in class ,
which-
it did n’t win points with her classmates , and it led to her being transferred to another class .   
Devastating on both fronts , because she had classmates she liked
and she loved her teacher .
”
“
How do you get ahead of that ?
” I asked .   
“
What do you do to balance it ?
”
“
Treat it like a full - time job ?
” Houndstooth asked .   
“ Preventative measures , like the ones
I ’m recommending .   
She ’ll go the extra mile unless you set up a roadblock to disallow that progress .   
So you have to stay ahead of that .   
She ’s a headache in that .
”
“
She mentioned she has a slip for study hall that gets her out of homework .   
It sounds like they ’re letting her use it , ” I said .
“
Great .   
I ’m glad that ’s there .   
It goes beyond just school .   
She ’s working on this job of yours at Cedar Point ?
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“
What limits did you set on that ?   
On her schedule ?
”
“
She needs to do her schoolwork , she does n’t let it impact her grades or attendance .   
Standard rules of conduct for Wards , carried forward .
”
“
That ’s one step , but it ’s not enough .   
She ’s ninety - five percent better ?   
That five percent says she ’s losing sleep , sitting in her bedroom or bunk in the dark , checking cameras and feeds or searching old footage .   
She ’ll work herself to the bone trying to uncover that gem that she can turn in to earn your affection .
”
I looked at Tristan , then Ashley .
I looked at Houndstooth .   
“
You think this is likely ?   
Even with her doing better ?
”
“ I would bet you real money .   
And I ’d be thrilled to , because my team is in a bad spot for funding , and it ’d help .
”
“
Fuck , ” Tristan said .   
“
We can narrow the window , set time restrictions .
”
“
Or we have her keep the majority of the tinker stuff at our place , ” I said .
“ Do both , ” Houndstooth said .   
“
She ’ll be working on other projects , possibly surprise projects , very similar to her art project in intent and execution .
”
“
She ’s working on some side projects , ” I said .   
“ The eye camera .   
A teleporter .
”
“ You do realize she does n’t build teleporters , right ?
” Houndstooth asked .
“
She does n’t lie , ” Ashley said , stern .   
“
Do n’t imply she does .
”
“
I was n’t implying , ” Houndstooth said .   
His voice softened , “ I framed that wrong .   
I think she can build Teleporters .   
But she does n’t .   
For the same reason she does n’t build guns , mechs , A.I. , chemicals , bio - stuff .   
She can do that stuff , but she ’ll make half a percent of progress in the time it takes her to complete a whole project in her skillset .   
She ’ll spend hundreds of dollars in materials to get that half a percent .
”
“
And the way you describe this- ” I started .   
“
She ’ll actually , genuinely try to complete the teleporter project , even at a glacial pace , at a massive cost to her well - being ?
”
“
Exactly , ” Houndstooth said .   
“ At least as far as I understand it .   
She ’ll try to finish the project , she ’ll believe it and make others believe she can do it , but I ’d bet she ’d self - destruct before getting a fifth of the way .
”
“
For all this talk of self - destruction and sacrificing health and sleep , she seems to be doing okay , ” I said .   
“ Freaked out after her call with you , weirdness , but
… nothing that ca n’t be handled , I do n’t think .
”
“ After the art project thing ?   
When she threw up in class ?   
Did n’t cry before , did n’t cry after .   
Not that we saw .   
I saw her cry once , and we were all crying then .   
Somewhere along the line , she learned that being troubled means people pulling away or pushing her away .
”
“ She ’s gotten better at showing it , ” Ashley said .   
“ The bag .   
That was positive .
”
“
That ’s really , really good , then .   
Because before ?   
It took the world ending to crack her .   
Outside of that , you ’d have a nine-
she ’s eleven now ?
”
“
Yeah , ” Tristan said .   
“ Thereabouts .
”
“
You ’d have an eleven year old , then , who ’s internalizing so much that she loses hair in patches or makes herself sick .   
She did n’t ever cry , she did n’t signal how upset she was .   
Even if she ’s doing better , you have to pay attention .
”
“
For ten percent of what you dealt with ?
” I asked .
“ Victoria , ” Houndstooth said .   
“
The school stuff , the Wards stuff was structured .   
There was natural pushback when she stepped over lines .   
Punishments , rules for the classroom , rules for the Wards , oversight , teams of people having hours - long meetings about her .   
The art project , moving classes , her being bullied because of her behavior and her visceral reactions to that , the bullying in school , all of that was the easy stuff .
”
“
Can I ask about the hard stuff ?
”
“
You can ask , but I do n’t know if I can summarize it .   
We had a nine year old girl with no stopping points when it came to anything social .   
No brakes , a practically nonexistent sense of boundaries , and zero emotional defenses .
”
“
An acquaintance of ours described her as a bull in a china shop with a profound love for dishware , ” Tristan said .
“
Do n’t joke , ” Ashley said .
“
It ’s pretty apt , ” Houndstooth said .   
“
And I do n’t think anyone ’s laughing .
”
“
What happened ?
” I asked .
“ One of her classmates’ families moved away , in large part because of her .     
One or two other families were seriously considering it .   
At least one of her teachers from the training camps was being investigated with a job and career on the line .   
Most people who were involved knew what the reality of Kenzie was , but procedures had to be followed , and when you have someone as vulnerable as she is , you ca n’t ever be one hundred percent sure .   
We had a similar thing with our Wards team leader , early on , but we were more proactive in anticipating it , and they were allegations of a different tint .   
I wish I could convey the trail of destruction .
”
“
No , ” Ashley said .
“
No ? ”
Houndstooth asked .
“
She ’s not a bull in a china shop .   
She ’s not a headache , she ’s not a bringer of destruction , a tinker , or Ward , a nine year old , or an eleven year old .   
You keep reducing her down , you make her small , and you make the problem big .
”
“
The problems were big , ” Houndstooth said .   
“
The problems threatened to end several careers , derailed others , and uprooted a family from their lives and hometown .   
She likes and falls in love with everyone
and it ’s only because of us being attentive that she did n’t actively let herself be the prey of a villain group or dangerous lunatic in some desperate hope of finding a connection with them .
”
“
She ’s not prey either , ” Ashley said , more heated .   
“
She ’s Kenzie Martin .   
She ’s a person .   
You may have only seen her cry once
but I ’ve seen her cry more times than I can count .
”
“
Really ?
” Tristan asked .   
“
When ? ”
“ During the meetings .   
After .   
During private conversations .
”
“ Crying is good , ” Houndstooth said .   
“
It ’s a step forward .   
It ’s very possible
she ’s made a lot of steps forward .   
It ’s clear you guys care about her and believe in her .   
But I ’ve met and interacted with Kenzie Martin , and I have a really hard time envisioning a Kenzie that ’s fixed .
”
“
Like she ’s a broken machine , ” Ashley said .
“ I do n’t want to say better because better can mean partway .   
What I ’m saying is that I ca n’t see a Kenzie that was that badly off , who ’s
… normal now .   
Or ever .
”
“ I hate that word , ” Ashley said .
“ I do n’t think there are any good words for something that hard to encapsulate , ” Houndstooth said .
“
What do you advise ?
” I asked .   
“ About the non - school , non - Ward stuff ?
”
“
Pay attention when she talks about new friends or people in particular , get ahead of that , introduce yourself , keep a close eye on things .   
Talk to her teachers .   
Talk to her foster parents , or the people at whatever institution she ’s at .   
They ’re probably pretty overloaded , but make them pay attention .   
Get everyone on the same page .   
Same rules for everyone , boundaries , sticking to those boundaries , limit physical contact and gestures of affection unless okayed by the therapist .
”
My eyebrows drew together .   
I glanced at Tristan , and he gestured , hand moving as if to dismiss , urging me to move on .   
I was pretty sure Houndstooth saw it too .
He did n’t speak up or act on it , though .
I made a mental note about the emphasis on foster parents .   
I ’d need to have a conversation with others and pay more attention to Julien and his wife .
“
Frankly , I ’d really lock down the school thing .   
See if you can have her rotate classes or do something non - classroom .   
Discourage friendships with classmates , because that ’s not going to go well .   
If she starts showing true romantic interest in anyone , shut it down hard .   
I would n’t advise her being on your team , frankly .
”
“
That ’s extreme , ” I said .
“
It ’s dehumanizing and disgusting , ” Ashley said .   
“ Until she ’s better , no human contact or relationships .   
Nobody can get close to her , nobody can show kindness , nobody can help her or accept help from her ?   
Just a breath or two away from you saying you do n’t ever think she ’ll be normal .   
You ’re disgusting .
”
She was starting to walk away , toward the path that had led us up the hill .
“ Ashley , ” I said .   
“
I get what you ’re saying , but we did agree to hear him out as a favor .
”
“
You hear him out then , ” she said .   
“ Tell me what you think I need to hear when you tell the others .   
But I ’m not going to stay here and listen to this degenerate imbecile reduce her to a problem that can be solved like that .   
She ’s human .
”
“
Can I tell an anecdote ?
”
“
Could I stop you without killing you ?
”
Ashley asked .
“
Can you wait for us at the station , Ashley ?
” Tristan asked .
She stalked off , and we were left with Houndstooth .
Houndstooth looked toward me and Tristan .   
“
There was a time , about a year back , where I was talking to a teammate .   
He said a food addiction was the only addiction that you could n’t go cold turkey on .   
You ca n’t not eat , and that ’s hard , when the addiction makes dealing with food in moderation next to impossible .   
Immediately , I thought of Kenzie .   
I thought , within a second or two of him saying that , he was wrong
, there was another addiction like that .   
You say she ’s human , but she ’s a people addict .   
She ’s addicted to humans .   
You ca n’t expect a young girl to not interact with people , and you ca n’t expect her to deal with people in moderation .
”
“
And you think the way to solve that is to … minimize that interaction to the barest bones ?
” I asked .
“
Over months and years , gradually loosen that belt .   
If the therapist okays it .
” I sighed .
“
She ’s doing exceptionally well , ” Tristan said .
“ You could hold a gun to my head , and I would n’t say she lacked a work ethic , ” Houndstooth said .   
“
She ’s brilliant for her age
, she ’s good - hearted in her way , and she does n’t deserve a thousandth of what she ’s gone through .   
It ’s heartbreaking and worrying .
”
Kenzie had named Houndstooth ’s team as her second big heartbreak .
“ Fuck the agents .
”
“
Powers and agents do n’t even really play into this , ” Houndstooth said .
“ If you took away her powers and the influence of her agent today , I ’d give you all the same warnings tomorrow .
” ⊙ We let ourselves into the headquarters .
Sveta was on her way .   
Chris was taking the day off for more Indulgence , not Wan , and that last part was supposed to be important .
Rain ’s absence in particular was very much felt , now that his situation had been painted in stark relief .   
Everyone was a little bit worried , now .
Ashley had her appointment .   
Tristan had to give Byron his turn .
Kenzie sat in her chair at the table - turned desk , the projector showing the camera ’s image of Cedar Point .
“
Did you skip class to get here as quick as you did ?
” I asked .
“
No , ” Kenzie said , not turning around .   
“
I went to class , I stopped in at study hall at the start of lunch and asked if I could go early .   
They said okay .   
You can call if you need to check .
”
“ I do n’t need to check , ” I said .   
“
You ’re honest .
”
“
Sorry for all the emails .   
Sveta yelled at me .   
Well , she did n’t yell , but she came close .   
I sent her almost as many as I sent you .
”
“
Did you eat lunch ?
”
“
It ’s in my bag , in case I get hungry .
”
“
Too nervous ?
”
I asked .
She turned around in her computer chair and smiled .   
“
Yeah .
”
“ Houndstooth wanted to make sure you were okay first .   
Making sure you were n’t getting too much homework , ” I said .   
“
He had some tips about how we should make sure you are n’t tinkering yourself to the bone after hours .
”
“ It helps sometimes .   
Distracting myself with it .
”
“ We should figure out a balance .   
He was suspicious you were staying up late , watching and rewatching camera feeds .
”
“
When I ca n’t sleep it ’s nice to be able to watch that stuff with my laptop beside me in the dark room .   
I doze off .
” I nodded .
“
Did he say the embarrassing stuff ?
”
“ I do n’t know what qualifies as embarrassing , ” I said .   
“ Problems with teachers , school .   
Tristan and Ashley defended you pretty fiercely .
”
“
And you ?
”
“ I just want to figure out what needs to be figured out , ” I said .   
“
So everyone ’s happy and healthy , and the team stays together and positive overall .   
I shared some of the good stuff I know of .
”
“
Did he mention the old lady ?
”
“
I ’m not sure .
”
“
She was on the internet
and she wanted a replacement for her dead daughter
and I almost went with her , and then later we started thinking she killed her daughter .   
Embarrassing .
”
“ That did come up .
”
“
And how I fell asleep watching TV on my friend
’s couch ?
”
“ That did n’t , I do n’t think .
”
“ Super embarrassing , ” she said .   
“
And my foster parents ?
”
“ Very briefly .
” She nodded .   
She smiled .   
“
Thanks for telling me .
”
I put my hand on the back of her chair and spun her in circles , my arm passing over her head on each rotation .   
“ Sveta ’s on her way .   
I think the others are mostly getting sorted out .   
With Rain hiding out , they ’re resting up and getting prepped .   
Did you get the email ?
”
“
I had my phone taken away .   
I ’m supposed to go to the principal ’s office with my mom or dad tomorrow if I want it back .
”
“
I suspected it was something like that , ” I said .   
I smiled .   
“
Less emails , and no using your phone in school unless it ’s an emergency .   
Houndstooth is going to make a move late this afternoon .
”
Kenzie put her hand out and stopped herself from spinning .
“
How ’s that ?
” I asked .
“
He does n’t want to see me or say hi ?
”
“
I ’m sorry ,
” I said .
“
He probably had a good excuse .   
He ’s good at those .   
It took me a while to figure out .
”
“ He does n’t want to tip off the villains about his relationship to us .
”
“
It makes sense , ” Kenzie said .
“
Do you want help with homework while we wait ?   
And you can eat your lunch ?
” I asked .   
“
If that nervousness has eased up .
”
“
I ’ll eat , ” she said .   
“
Help with homework would be a good way to kill the time , too .
”
“
Perfect , ” I said .
I stepped away to look at the whiteboards while Kenzie got ready .








I watched over the group .
We were getting settled in .   
Tables were moved , whiteboards arranged , and chairs put together .   
It was starting to look more like a hideout .   
Sveta was doing her name in a fancy script on her board , Kenzie was doing homework , and I had plugged my laptop in , with my notes up , but it was n’t my focus in the moment .
Byron had taken his turn .   
Two hours and fifteen minutes after we ’d parted ways , Tristan was back at the hideout .   
He ’d taken off his black jacket and folded it over the back of a chair , and was doing some of the setup stuff , while wearing a red t - shirt , jeans , and chukka boots .   
He was athletic , and I remembered Byron had n’t given me that impression when I ’d seen him .
“
Hey Tristan , ” I said .
He ’d moved over to his whiteboard , and stepped back and away to look my way .
“
Hey , what do you think ?
” he asked .   
He extended a hand , indicating his work : he had sketched out a rough floor plan of the room .   
The area was an open - concept apartment , a bathroom closed off , the rest of it without walls , which gave us our room to maneuver , and it looked like Tristan was trying to figure out where the other things we needed might go .   
A list of bullet points said ‘ cot’ , ‘ mini fridge’ , and ‘ team sign’ .
I frowned a bit as I saw that last one .
“ Team sign ?
” I asked .
“
Sure .   
I figured it would be good for morale .   
We could have Sveta paint it and put it up on the wall .   
Something nice to remind ourselves that we ’re a team .
”
“
I could paint something , ” Sveta said , looking away from her work .   
“
I ’m kind of anxious to have a name , and we ’d have to decide that first .
”
“ That could be neat , ” I said .   
“
My take on reading that was that you wanted to hang the sign outside .
” Tristan smiled .   
“
Something nice and big , colorful , with a by - line saying something about how we ’re a covert team of heroes .
”
“ I was n’t sure , ” I said .
“ Believe it or not
, I ’m not a dumb guy , ” he said .   
“
Stubborn , maybe-
”
“
Definitely , ” Kenzie called out , sitting at her desk .   
She was leaning over her homework .
“ Most definitely , ” Sveta said .
“ Fine .   
But I ’m not dumb .   
I ’m thinking about the things we need to get in terms of things we can fold up or pack away , since we may be moving a lot .   
We can fold up the cot , I can carry a mini fridge , these tables have legs that can fold up to the underside , and for the sign , I was picturing getting three separate canvases and having us put them up there so it connects or lines up .
”
“ Could work , ” I said .
“ Three part name ?
” Sveta asked .
“
No idea , ” Tristan said .   
“
Sorry , Vic , you were going to say something ?
”
“ I was going to ask if you train , or if the extra strength is from the powers .   
Biokinesis or whichever .
”
“ I train , ” Tristan said .   
“ I was just thinking of setting up a punching bag or something , actually .
”
“
Yeah ?
” I asked .
“
I usually end up with restless energy to burn .   
I lift , I run on the treadmill , and I had a class I took with Reach , but obviously it ’s been a while .   
Works with my enhanced strength .
”
“
So it does help , then .
”
“ You look like you do something , ” Tristan said .
“ I do , ” I said .   
“
Or I did .   
I do n’t have access to my dad ’s equipment or the stuff I had while helping out with the Patrol Block .
”
“ Does it help ?   
Powerwise ?
” I shook my head .   
“ Forcefield derived strength .   
I ’m strong enough to tear apart an engine block with my hands .   
That would n’t change if I did n’t get off the couch and weighed three hundred pounds or if I was a bodybuilder .
”
“ Why bother if you can tear apart engine blocks ?
” Tristan asked .
“ Why do I walk when I could fly ?   
I ’d atrophy , for one thing , and I ca n’t always use my strength .   
I do n’t have the control to do something more delicate .   
I-
I honestly do n’t trust my power , a lot of the time .
”
Sveta came to stand beside me , to get a look at Tristan
’s idea of a finished floor plan and join the conversation .
“ …
There ’s a middle ground , and I ’d like to be able to function in it , ” I finished .
“
It ’s kind of where I ’m at , ” Sveta said .   
“
Except I ’m not trying to find a middle ground between one hundred miles an hour and a standstill .   
I ’m using this body to bring myself to a point five percent of the way between zero and a thousand miles an hour .
”
“ Vroom , ” Kenzie said , without turning to look at us .
She ’d been just a little subdued .
“
And it does n’t change , then .   
It is what it is ?
” Tristan asked .   
“
For both of you , I guess ?
”
“
Yeah , ” Sveta said .   
“
Or-
I do n’t know , but I ’m strong enough .   
I ’m not going to go try to figure out what I can do to make these things stronger .
”
As Tristan glanced at me , I made a rectangle with my fingers .   
“
It ’s complicated .   
It fluctuates .   
I could name some terms and things that apply there , but I do n’t want to bore you .
”
“ I ’ve been bored enough times .   
I know a lot of the terms .   
Sechen ranges ?
”
“
That ’s one of them .   
Powers often get stronger with certain influencing factors .   
You read up on that ?
”
“ We did a ton of testing with Reach , and we saw a lot of parahuman science people while we were trying to figure out a solution .   
They think it ’s a straight multiplier .   
I have one point three to one point six times the strength and overall fitness .
”
“ Handy , ”
I said .   
“ And Byron ?
”
“ A bit of resistance to temperature extremes .   
He gets a higher percent , he ’d probably remember his specific numbers better than I do , but unless it ’s winter or we ’re dealing with a heat wave , it does n’t apply as often .
”
“
On the note of Byron … the second part to my question is , how does the exercise thing work for Byron ?   
Because exercise is monotonous enough when you ’re getting something out of it .
”
“
He commented on that a while ago , actually .   
We negotiated something .   
He made a short list of movies , and I watch his movies while I work out .   
Similar thing with the trips here and back .   
I sometimes give him extra time , especially if I have something to think about , which is most times these days .
”
“
That sounds pretty good .
”
“ Was n’t always good , ” Tristan said .   
“ Moonsong had some things right , back at the Wardens’ place .   
I was n’t always good at being fair .   
It went the other way , Byron- ” Tristan stopped there .
“
I wo n’t finish that thought .   
Byron is Byron , and I ’m me , and I ’ve got to own my shit without comparing .   
I was n’t always good at being fair , ” Tristan said .   
“
I ’m good at a lot of things .   
I can kick ass and look pretty great while doing it ,
I ’m tenacious ,
I tend to finish what I set my mind to .   
But fair is hard .
”
“ It is , ” I said .
“
It ’s hard enough figuring out how to be fair to ourselves , ” Sveta said .
“
Too true , ” I said .   
I glanced over at Kenzie .
“
Punching bag ?
” Tristan asked .   
He pointed at the corner , next to Chris’ whiteboard .   
“
I do n’t need to do anything special for you guys ?
”
“ Regular punching bag for me , ” I said .   
“
I ’ll use it .   
It ’s going to be a chore to move if we change locations , though .
”
“ Noted , ” Tristan said .   
“
Maybe we should all get one pain - in - the - ass contribution to the hideout and this can be mine .
”
“ I ’ve already got mine , ” Kenzie said , from the other end of the room .   
She kicked her box and the images projected on the wall changed .
“
Bag ’s good ,
” I said , as I started walking over .   
“
No objection .
” I approached Kenzie .   
The image was projected onto the wall in front of her , moving between the two cameras .   
An addition had been made , and as each person walked down the street , stylized crosshairs tracked their faces .   
Most had logos and names .   
A lot of them were just things in the vein of ‘ [ New31]’ with the number changing , not names .
One of the cameras moved .   
It focused in on a scene where two people wearing aprons were smoking by the back stairs of a restaurant .   
The little space between four buildings did n’t really qualify as an alley , as it looked like back doors and fire escapes were the only way to get down to the area .   
An enclave , maybe .   
The camera moved until it tracked a person in costume .   
The guy ’s mask looked like it covered all but a third of his face , the bottom right of his jaw and the top left of his forehead exposed , with ceramic shards framing each ‘ hole’ .   
Curved metal bars reminiscent of piping extended around to the back of his head , holding the mask in place .
The camera seemed to recognize the mask , and labeled him as ‘ [ Kitchen Sink]’ .   
We ’d seen him before , but the label thing was new .
Off to the side , as part of a sidebar with data and labels , there were a series of countdown timers .
HT & Team :
8:21 Ashley Train to Station : 0:45 

Average Ash Walk Time :
4:10
When I stood behind Kenzie ’s chair , I saw that even with a dozen workbooks and pieces of homework strewn in front of her , she was n’t doing her schoolwork .   
She had a projected image in front of her , drawn out in three dimensions , with the same image drawn on a paper in front of her in marker .   
The lines of the three dimensional image looked similar to a marker ’s .   
With gestures and prods of a pen , Kenzie adjusted the particulars .
“
What do you think ?
” she asked .   
She used her hands , gesturing , and made it bigger .   
Turning around in her chair , bringing the drawn object with her , she moved her hands and superimposed the image over her head .
A mask , or a helmet .   
Eyeless , in a way , with a flat pane extending from the eyes , over her nose , down to a pointed chin .   
Three round lenses were placed along the line of her eyebrows , one round lens was on each cheekbone , and she had two spherical attachments , much like the buns she tended to wear her hair in .   
Probably intended to fit over the buns .
“ I like it better than the one you wore for the training exercise , ” I said .   
“
It does make me think of a spider , with all of the eyes .
”
“ Is that a bad thing ?
”
“ I do n’t think you make me think ‘ spider’ at all .   
It ’s a bit too inhuman .   
What if … can I draw ?   
I do n’t want to ruin your drawing .
”
“ Go ahead .   
Use my pen .   
Squint one eye when you want it to draw .
”
The countdown timers marked Ashley ’s departure from the train .   
The ‘ walk time’ timer was highlighted and started counting down .
I tried my hand at drawing little triangles at the side of each of the round lenses .   
A tiny triangle to represent eyelashes .
“
Oh , cute ! ”
Kenzie said .   
“
Can you draw a second , smaller one ?   
And leave off the eyelashes on the cheekbones , because I ’m doing something different there ,
and-
”
“
Here , ” I said .   
I passed her the pen .
She began to change things , keeping all but two of the eyelashes
I ’d drawn .
Someone labeled ‘ [ Joe]’ walked down the street , a bag slung over his shoulder .   
He entered the same bar I ’d encountered Moose outside of .   
The one where Snag and Love Lost had gone inside .
I looked at some of the other names .
“ Fifi ?
” I asked .
“
Huh ?
” Kenzie asked .   
She looked up , and    I pointed at a blonde girl with hair that looked like she ’d just about destroyed it with bleaching .   
Frizzed out to the point I doubted she could get a comb through it .   
She ’d resorted to using a headband and hair tie to try to get it in order .   
The headband and hair tie did n’t match her outfit .
“
Oh .   
She looked like a Fifi .   
I named some of the ones I see a lot .
”
“
She does look vaguely poodle - ish , and Fifi seems like a poodle name to me .
”
“
Exactly , ” Kenzie said , with satisfaction .   
She returned to writing down something that looked like code and formula , periodically poking her pen at her projected image of her mask .
I looked at ‘ Fifi’ .   
“
Poor her .   
When I was a little younger than you are now , I tried dying my hair to be like my cousin , and it went badly .   
I was so inconsolable .
”
“
What happened after ?
” Kenzie asked .
“
My mom hired a professional to get me back to normal , and it was mostly fixed .   
We bought some products to keep my hair from ending up like that after .   
I ca n’t imagine the professional or the products were cheap , and we were pretty tight on cash back then .   
She knew it was important to me .
”
My heart hurt a little , thinking of that .
“
That ’s the way it should be , ” Kenzie said .
“
Yeah , ” I said .
She turned my way , putting on the projected helmet so it was superimposed over her head .   
When she took her hands away and moved her head , the helmet moved with her head .
Now , though , the eyes of the mask widened and closed , as camera - like shutters closed around the edges .   
The eyelashes moved up and down a little , and shutters moved in lopsided ways , with only some of the shutters closing .   
Coming down from the top , curved forward , angry .   
Coming in from the bottom .
“
Are you changing your expression ?
”
“
Yes !   
It worked .   
Awesome .   
Okay , and let ’s try this .
”
Her eyelashes moved , until one was pointing straight up , one was pointing straight down .   
The eyes all briefly turned white .
“ I think that worked .   
White eyes and … targeting mode ?
”
“ Not targeting mode .   
I could build something like the flash gun into it .   
I can strike a pose and do the eye thing , like they ’re crosshairs , and flash .   
There ’d probably only be room for one shot .   
Okay , colors-
”
She tapped her pen on her desk .   
The mask changed from shades of gray to pink and sky blue .   
I winced , and she immediately changed to the next .   
Seafoam green and black .   
Through each change , the circles at her cheekbones remained a slightly different shade , more muted .
“
Something less garish , maybe ?
” I asked .   
“
That one looks a little villainous .   
Cute , but villainous .
”
She tapped her pen a few times , then made a mark on the paper .
Lemon - lime and dark gray , with green - gray circles for the cheekbones .
“ Better . ”
“
Ooh , I know a thing .   
I can do a thing .
”
She turned , and she started scribbling .   
She seemed energized .
But as she turned , the image at one of her cheekbones broke up , becoming transparent , like a few squares had been cut out of the image .   
It flickered as I moved my head to view it at another angle .
“
You ’ve got a distortion , ” I said .   
I pointed .
“
Silly me , ” she said .
The entire helmet disappeared .
“
Something similar happened when your picture was taken at the Warden ’s HQ , ” I said .
“
Yeah .
”
“
You ’re wearing a projection ?
”
“
Not really , ” she said .   
She scribbled .   
“
I ’m wearing tech , and it conflicts with stuff
so it can be hard to coordinate .   
I would n’t call it wearing .
”
“
No ? ”
“
Wearing makes me think full - body , or covering my head
and I mean , I had that costume thing for the training , and that did n’t last that long .   
How could or would I wear something else and have it last all day or whatever ?   
I mean , I wish I could .
”
“ I wish I could , ” I said .   
I did n’t want to press or be harsh , but I did n’t want to let this lie either .   
I went easy , instead .   
“
I ’m slightly concerned if you ’re using projections like that .
”
“
I ’m not
that devious , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I would n’t bring something and pretend to have a short battery life
so I can hide that I have a longer battery life for something else I ’m secretly using .   
That ’s not what I do
and that ’s not
how I am .
”
“ I know , ” I said .   
“
I do n’t get the impression you ’re devious or that you ’d go to those lengths .
”
Kenzie looked up at the clock .
Average Ash Walk Time : -1:13
“
She ’ll turn up , ” I said .
“ I know .   
I just want her here before Houndstooth calls , ” Kenzie said .   
“ One
second .
”
She kicked the cube .   
It went dark , and the camera image dropped away .
“ Victoria !
”
Tristan called me from the far end of the room .
“
What ?
”
“
Can we use your computer ?
”
“
Yeah .
”
Tristan and Sveta gathered together at my computer
, Tristan ’s hands at the keyboard .
“
The tech you ’re wearing .   
The distortions .   
I want to make sure you ’re taking care of yourself .   
That you do n’t have dark circles under your eyes , or bruises , or anything like that .
”
She turned her head to look at me over her shoulder and smiled .   
“
It ’s off .   
I turned my tech off to synchronize everything across all fields .   
This is me .
”
She showed me her phone , where the progress bar was filling up .
“ Gotcha , ” I said .
“ I know Houndstooth said stuff .   
I think he said it in a caring way because he ’s one of the best guys out there .   
True blue hero , like Weld .   
Like you .
”
I was reminded of how I ’d handled Presley on the train .   
I ’d recognized how she ’d needed me to be more than human , because she idolized me , she ’d seen me as something to reach for .
I wondered if Kenzie wanted me to be the same thing .
“ I do n’t know if I am .   
I ’m pretty angry about things .   
I ’m …
really concerned about a lot of things .   
Negative emotions drive an awful lot of what I do .
”
The lock on the door clicked .   
Ashley let herself in , then locked it behind her .   
She smiled at Kenzie and me , then gave the other two a small salute .
Kenzie had visibly brightened at Ashley ’s appearance .
“
The things you do are good , ” Kenzie said .   
“ At least as far as I ’ve seen and researched .
”
She researched me .
“
And I think that ’s
what counts , ” Kenzie said .
“
It ’s nuanced .
”
“ If Houndstooth sat you down to tell you about me and he did n’t say I ’m bad at nuance , he screwed up , ” Kenzie said .   
“
And he does n’t screw up .
”
The projector box lit up , and the video image popped back up .   
Kenzie ’s phone changed from the progress bar , and her helmet reappeared , floating just over the paper where it had been drawn .
“ Roughly one minute until Houndstooth !
” Kenzie reported .
“
Got it , ” Tristan said .
Ashley approached , standing by Kenzie ’s chair , and laid a hand on Kenzie ’s left shoulder .
“
You good ?
” I asked .
“ Working hands .   
No pain .   
We ’re still working with this cretin ?
”
“ Cretin ?
” Kenzie asked .
“
Houndstooth , ” Ashley said .   
“
He did n’t impress me .
”
“
Okay , wow .   
Let me start by saying you impress me , ” Kenzie said , looking up at Ashley .   
“
I love those videos you ’re in , and I loved seeing you train .   
You ’re awesome .   
And you ’re totally , one hundred percent wrong , this once .   
Because Houndstooth is awesome and impressive too .
”
“
Houndstooth ’s
concerns seemed to come from a well - intentioned , good place , ” I said , interjecting .   
Kenzie ’s head whipped around to look at me over her other shoulder .   
I added ,    “
And despite that , he seemed to come to some extreme conclusions .   
There ’s nuance , between where you ’re coming from and where you end up .   
Like we were just talking about .
”
“
When I called him a cretin I was being gentle .   
He ’s a disgusting , disappointing , subnormal excuse for a hero , cape , or human being .
”
“
I will fight you over this , ” Kenzie said .
“ You ’d lose .
”
“ I will go to war with you .   
Houndstooth was one of the coolest people to me at one of my uncoolest times .
”
Tristan and Sveta had noticed things were a little hairy and were approaching at a jog .   
I interjected , saying , “ We might want to drop this .   
Let the topic lie .
”
“
No , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Not if she ’s going to say anything more like what she just said .
”
“
He talked about you like
you were nothing more than a problem .
”
“ I am a problem !
”
Kenzie said , raising her voice .
“ Easy , ” I said .   
Tristan and Sveta joined us .
“
I ’m a problem , ” Kenzie said , quieter .   
“
I was .
”
“
You ’re more than the problem , ” Ashley said .   
“
That waste of space didn’t- ” “
Do you want to go to war ?
”
Kenzie asked , rising out of her seat .   
“
I can build an army of camera drones .   
I have advantage in the air .   
I have battlefield awareness .   
And I ’ll fight you on this until you explode me all over the place
or you say you ’re wrong about him .   
Do n’t say bad things about him .   
Not when he ’s someone that counts .   
Not when you ’re someone that counts .   
Okay ?
”
Sveta reached out and pushed Kenzie back down into her seat .   
Tristan was closer to Ashley , facing her , ready to get between the two .
“ Kenzie , ” Sveta said .   
“ Ashley ’s coming from a good place here .
”
“ I know that , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I also know that Houndstooth is .
”
“
You ’re better than he makes you out to be .   
You ca n’t put so much faith in the words of someone who so clearly knows so little , ” Ashley said .
Kenzie shook her head , smiling like she could n’t believe the conversation
she was a part of .
“
He ’s weak , and he ’s a loser .   
He ’s the lowest of the low .
”
The phone trilled with a rising series of beeps .   
The projected image on the screen showed the person calling : Houndstooth .
Kenzie leaped forward , swatting aside Sveta ’s hand and dodging mine .   
She grabbed the front of Ashley
’s top , and hauled it down , making Ashley bend down .
Ashley ’s hand moved , and Tristan grabbed her wrist , stopping it from going wherever it was going to go .   
He grabbed Kenzie with the other hand , ready to pull her away if need be .
“ Woah , ” Tristan said .
I moved closer , putting my hands on Kenzie ’s shoulders , freeing Tristan to focus more on Ashley .
So small .   
Her shoulders were narrow .
Kenzie raised her free hand , and pressed it against Ashley ’s mouth , so her fingers were on either side of Ashley ’s nose .   
Had her fingers been longer , the tips and nails might have been near Ashley ’s eyes .
“
Do n’t say anything , ” Kenzie said .
The phone trilled its beeps again .
“
Please do n’t say anything .   
Please .
”
There was a pause , silence .
The phone spat out its series of beeps .
“
Please let this go
okay ,
” Kenzie said .   
“ That will do more than anything .
”
The silence hung .   
The phone could only ring so many times .
Kenzie started to smile , and the smile faltered .   
“ Please ?   
I ’ll do anything .
”
Ashley straightened , pulling away from Kenzie ’s hands .   
She turned away , folding her arms .
The rest of us relaxed .   
Kenzie , too , turned away , stepping away from my hands .   
She grabbed the phone off the table and tossed it to Tristan .
The phone was mid - ring when Tristan answered .
“
Sorry about the delay .   
Capricorn here .   
Four of the six members of the team are here , and our coach is here too , ” Tristan said .   
He backed up a few steps , until Ashley was in front of him , facing him .   
“
I think we ’re going to put you on speakerphone if that ’s okay .
”
Ashley nodded once .
“
Great , ” Tristan said .   
A response for both Houndstooth and Ashley , it seemed .
Kenzie hit a key .
“
Hello again , ” Houndstooth said .   
“
I ’ve got my team here , and we ’re north of Cedar Point .   
We ’re getting sorted out , costumes already on , but there ’s other stuff to do .   
Minions to summon , ammo to load .   
I ’m really hoping that none of it is needed .
”
“
Same here , ” Tristan said .   
“
We ’ve been keeping an eye on things
and I think it ’s pretty quiet right now .
”
“ Perfect .
”
I raised my hand a bit to signal
I was going to speak , then stepped forward a bit .   
“ Victoria here .   
I think there are three villains-
”
Kenzie ’s hand went up , four fingers extended .
“
Four villains out and about around the city .   
A few left on a road trip earlier in the afternoon .   
There are also a couple you ’ll want to be aware of .
”
“
Anything you can give us is great .
”
Kenzie hit a key .   
The camera moved to Kitchen Sink , with his ceramic mask .
“ Kitchen Sink .   
He ’s the closest to you , big , minor brute aspect , but his thing is he acts as a blaster .   
Long and sustained series of junk being thrown at high velocities .   
Everything but the kitchen sink , as the saying goes .
”
“
That ’s so bad a schtick
it ’s great , ” a voice on the line said .   
One of Houndstooth ’s subordinates , feminine - sounding .
“
He ’s in the company of Hookline .   
Minor mover , has a hundred - foot long cable he telekinetically controls .   
It ca n’t be broken or damaged , short of some very select powers , and it will shake off or slip free of a lot of things that would snag or impede another weapon .   
Frost , hands that try to grab it .   
So do n’t try .   
It moves faster and acts like a whip , so be super careful if a fight happens .   
There ’s a hook on the end , and he ’s most dangerous if you ’re at or just inside
that hundred foot limit of his range where the hook is flying around .   
Which brings me to my next point .
”
“ They ’re willing to hurt people ?
”   
Houndstooth asked .
“
Kitchen Sink and Hookline are .   
They ’re part of one clique in Cedar Point
that ’s more violent than the others .   
Aggressive , violent , even borderline bloody .   
They might be acting as enforcers for others .
”
“
Breaking kneecaps , ” Tristan said .
“
Got it , ” Houndstooth said .
“ Hookline and Sink , ” the feminine voice said .   
“
Oh my god .
”
“ Moose seems to be going around between groups , passing on messages or checking on things .   
Strong brute , something to do with shockwaves .   
He hits hard , he moves a lot faster than you ’d expect from someone that big , and he has decent combat sense .   
I wish we could give you more information on him , but all I know is from a brief scrap with him .
”
“
You said the other two might pick a fight .   
What about this guy ?
”
“
Low odds the other two pick a fight without checking with the leadership , but if someone was to pick a fight , it ’d be people from their group .   
Moose would sooner negotiate or look to talk than fight , and he ’d only really fight if he thought he needed to or if he was certain he could win .   
I think your worry is going to be having something in mind to tell Moose that passes the sniff test .
”
“
We ’re curious what ’s going on , the Hill is a mess , and we ’re wondering if these are greener pastures than Greenwich .
”
Tristan said , “ If others are going to show interest , we want to drop a hint .   
Something that makes them wonder .   
You could mention sponsorship and a reshuffling of jurisdictions .
”
“
There ’s talk of war , ” Sveta interjected .   
“
I know someone who ’s having to spend time away , and they ’re bringing people in from other teams to fill holes .
”
“ I heard about that , ” Houndstooth said .
“ You could use that .   
It happened with villain communities in the past .   
A void appears , villains rush to fill it , there ’s upheaval , and then things settle .
”
She looked at me as she said that last bit .
I ’d said something like that at the group therapy meeting , had n’t I ?
“ If Moose challenges us , I ’ll say something like that .
”
“
There ’s also a woman that ’s collecting protection money right now .   
Bluestocking .   
From the brainiac clique .
”
“ These guys are so lame , I love it , ”
Houndstooth ’s subordinate said .
“
There ’s something to keep in mind , ” I said .   
“ These guys congregated here .   
If something happens , and I do n’t know if Moose would let it unless you forced the issue , then you ’ll have a lot more in your hair .   
They ’re banding together and as lame as any individual might be , they ’re finding a lot of people who match up with them .   
Thematically or in style .
”
“
We ’re seeing that more in general , ” Houndstooth said .   
“ Lots of capes condensed into a relatively tight geographic area .
”
“
You ’re going to see it in effect here .   
Two clairvoyants are keeping an eye on the area .   
One of them is a clairaudient , so they ’ll have an ear on the area too .   
I could go into detail , but I think it ’s better and easier to just say that once you enter Cedar Point they ’re going to be fully aware of everything you say or do .   
Be careful what you say , and be aware we ca n’t communicate with you unless it ’s an emergency .
”
“ That also means no mockery or jokes , ” Houndstooth said , his voice quieter , like he did n’t have his mouth near the phone .   
“
And as far as we ’re concerned , your team does n’t exist .
”
“
It would mean a ton if you could be especially careful about that , ” Tristan said .
“ We ’ll be careful , ” Houndstooth said .   
“
I trust my guys .   
Give us a couple of minutes , and we ’ll move through , make our faces known .   
I want to plan what we do if we run into the guys you talked about .
”
“
Call us again when it ’s time , ” Tristan said .
“ Will do .   
I like this a lot , good briefing , great intelligence .   
This is great stuff , guys .
”
The call ended .
Tristan huffed out a breath , glancing at Ashley .
“
Great stuff , and he likes it ,
” Kenzie said , quiet .   
Her legs kicked , just barely scuffing the plastic rim that the wheels of the computer chair stuck down from .   
“
Now I get to see Houndstooth on camera .   
Wooo .
”
Her voice was so quiet it might have sounded unenthusiastic , but the speed her legs kicked at doubled with that last utterance .
“
We should get people out there in case things go bad and we need to extract , ” Tristan said .
“ I can fly out , ” I said .
“ I ’ll go , ” Sveta said .
“ I can be there in ten minutes if I need to be , maybe as few as five , ” Tristan said .   
“
I ’ll hold down the fort here until then .   
Ashley-
I ’d rather keep you in reserve .   
If everything falls to pieces , we ’ll bring you in to great effect .
”
She nodded , and then she walked away , approaching the empty whiteboard that was supposed to be hers .   
Some of her things were in a bag at the base of the board .
Sveta and I stepped out , and I used my flight to lift up off the fire escape .
“
I ’m worried about them , ” Sveta said .   
“
And I wish there was a flagpole or tree close by
I could grab .
”
“ I can help a bit with that last part , ” I said .   
I rose up and away , then extended a hand .
She shot her hand and arm at me , and I caught it .   
She pulled herself my way , not at her fastest , but fast enough I felt my heart jump in my chest .
I flew back and away , as she hauled herself in , and matched her general direction .   
It made for a tiny bit more slack .
She let go of me , and she pulled herself to a tree .   
From there , she moved to a roof .
Like a frog ’s tongue , snapping out , seizing something .   
But the frog went to the fly , rather than the other way around .   
To the branch , to the railing , to the fence , then to the chimney .
She was faster than me for short distances , and only a bit slower for the sustained movement .   
We did n’t have far to go ,
so she did pretty well at getting ahead of me .   
Only the escape from the fire escape had slowed her down .
“ Hold up , ”
I called out , as she started to move northward .   
“
Here ’s good .
”
We parked ourselves near where I ’d been the day prior , on a rooftop with the water separating us and Cedar Point .
“
I ’m glad
it ’s you and me , ” she said .
I bumped her shoulder with mine .
The phone rang .   
I pulled it from my pocket , connected my earbuds , and put one bud in my ear , one in Sveta ’s .
“
One camera on H.T. , one in Moose ’s general vicinity , ” Kenzie announced .   
“
The valiant H.T. is leading his team in .   
Five of them .
”
I touched the button on the screen to mute my end of the conversation , so we ’d only hear , not say anything .
“ We tried to get ahold of Rain and we could n’t .   
I ’m worried , ” Sveta said .   
“
I know he ’s impossible to get ahold of when he ’s with his family
, they ’re off the grid
but I do n’t know .
”
The phone flicked between a view of Houndstooth and the villains .
“
Today ’s the third time Chris chose the optimism - indulgence route in five days , I think .
”
“
What do you mean ?   
He ’s not balancing it out ?
”
“ I asked what he was doing to balance it out and he said I should mind my own business .
”
I could see the thread of what Sveta was getting at .
“
You ’re worried about things as a whole .
”
“ Are n’t you ?
” she asked .
I nodded .
Except maybe worry was the wrong word .   
It implied hand - wringing .   
Sweating , nervousness .
It was n’t that I was afraid or that it was worse than worry , either .   
I was becoming far more aware of the problems , for things as a whole .
“
What the mother - loving hell ?
”
Moose ’s voice came through the earbuds .   
It sounded weird , captured by cameras at a great distance , sent to Kenzie , sent to us , passed through the earbuds .   
He ’d just received the news .   
The video on the phone showed him sending people away on errands .   
Fetching others .
“ We have movement , ” Tristan said .   
“ They ’re getting organized .
”
We watched .   
I carried on with my conversation with Sveta .   
“ Ashley has had a couple of serious episodes that I ’ve seen now .   
Many lesser episodes , too .
”
“
Yes .
”
“
There ’s a big part of me that was waiting for the other shoes to drop and that part of me feels … not worse , now that those shoes have dropped , ” I said .
“
I do n’t feel not worse .
”
“
I can see flashes and hints of what you ’re trying to bring out in Ashley , ” I admitted .   
“
She ’s not someone I would have spent time with , in another context .   
I do n’t know how to handle things when she casually mentions her capacity to murder people , as if it ’s a way to win an argument .
”
“ The threats are usually empty , ” Sveta said .   
“
That ’s a plus .
”
“ I want to figure this out , ” I said .   
“ I want to help .   
It ’s like Kenzie is a distillation of every vulnerable person I ’ve ever tried to help , and Ashley is a distillation of every really fascinating branding exercise where you take a random villain and try to paint them as a hero and even bring out the hero inside them .   
Tristan and Byron are this really fascinating problem with powers
and I ’m a power geek
and I really wonder if there ’s a solution .
”
“
How do you parse Rain ?
” Sveta asked quiet .
“
I mean-
” I stopped .   
“
I ’m doing exactly what Ashley got so angry at Houndstooth for doing .   
I ’m reducing people down to conveniently sized problems .   
I get that , you know ?   
They are n’t just that .   
Kenzie is really complex and intelligent , she ’s clearly been through a lot , and I one hundred percent believe Houndstooth when he says she ’s good hearted .   
The fact that she clearly adores Ashley and she fought her that hard on things to stand up for someone else she holds close to her heart ?   
That ’s amazing .   
I could say similar things about Ashley , Tristan , Byron .
” Sveta nodded .   
“ And me ?
”
“ I ’m
so caught up in everything
I …
”
I tried to find the words , and felt a pang .   
I tried to make sense of that feeling as I said , “ I find myself missing you , even though you ’re there .
”
“ I know .   
We should have talked like this sooner .
”
“ You ’re doing amazing and my biggest fear with you is that I ’m going to be an obstruction , not a help .
”
“
No , I ca n’t ever see that .
”
“ I worry .   
I do n’t want to tamper with something that ’s working .
”
“ I need help .   
I ’m anxious , and there are things I need .   
Not from a teammate , but- ”
“ From a friend ?
” I asked .
She nodded , something in her rattling slightly with the movement .
“
As one part of that , then , I really want to take you shopping , that needs addressing , because this- ” I touched her top .   
She was wearing a beige top with a blue anchor on the front .   
The top was in two pieces , knotted above the shoulder , with smaller bits knotted along her sides .
“
This is cute , but I really want to see more sides of you .
”
“ I want you to take me shopping too , ” she said .
I reached for her hand , and I gave it a waggle .
“
I ’m thinking about Rain a lot , ” Sveta said .
“
He has me worried .   
Not just because of the hit out on his head .   
But because he ’s not telling the truth about everything .   
The lies make sense , it seems to make sense to hide things when in his situation .   
But I ’m not getting to see that good side of him either .   
So for now , I want to help him .   
But my motivations are somewhat selfish .   
My hometown got wiped out by a seemingly insurmountable , inevitable , unstoppable force .   
We lost .   
I-
I do n’t think I ever fully came back from those losses .
”
“
I ’m so sorry .
”
“
And now we have Rain being targeted by a seemingly insurmountable , inevitable , unstoppable force .   
I ’m being selfish , but I want to help him and get a win this time around .
”
“ I do n’t think that ’s selfish .
”
“
My entire hero career before the hospital and the years leading up to that career were a fantasy or exercise in me having powers and being a hero , and I ’m not sure I was ever heroic about it .   
I just see that past me as wholly motivated in selfishness , ego , pride , and a drive to be celebrated .
”
“ I do n’t think it ’s selfish , ” Sveta said .   
“
You ’re not that .   
You ’re here , doing this .   
You ’re helping .
”
“
The ends justify the … possible justifications ?
” I asked .   
“
I just had this conversation with Kenzie .   
I ’m not sure it ’s a good thing if I ’m having it again .
”
“
It ’s where your head and heart are at .
” I shrugged , looking at the video feed .
Moose and Prancer were meeting up .   
Prancer had two friends with him .   
On the other feed , the heroes were walking through the neighborhood .   
Talking to shop owners and residents .   
Sink and Hookline watched from the sidelines , Houndstooth ’s subordinates hanging back and watching them in turn .
“
Where are you at ?
” I asked .
“
Weld has been telling me things about what ’s going on elsewhere .   
Things he should n’t be telling me , but I think a lot of it is the kind of thing like a husband with a certain position might tell his wife , sometimes , even when those things are confidential .
”
“ Wife ?
” I asked .   
I raised an eyebrow .
“ Shut up , ” Sveta said , lifting her chin a bit , looking mock - affronted .   
“
Not another word about that .
”
“
You ’re the one who said the word .
”
“
Anyway , ” Sveta said .   
“
I ca n’t repeat those things , but I worry more than I used to .   
I get anxious .   
There ’s a part of everyone else in the group in me , and when they struggle it feels like I ’m struggling .
”
“
I can sort of relate to that .
”
“ I need people
and I scare them away .   
Tristan told me what Houndstooth said .   
None of it ’s too surprising .   
There are people who know a dangerous amount about me
and I think they ’d hurt me if they had a chance .   
I ’m a killer .   
I ’m constantly at war with another side of myself .   
I ’m perpetually off balance
and I do n’t know if I ’ll ever have that balance .
”
“ That kinship might be why you ’re able to connect to the others .
”
“
Do n’t say it .   
Do n’t sound like Weld .
”
“
It ’s true , ” I said .   
“
You ’re the team
’s mom .
”
“
Oh no , ” Sveta said .
“
That ’s so much worse than what I thought you were going to say .   
I thought you were going to call me the team
’s heart , like Weld does .   
I ca n’t be a mother .   
No !
”
I was about to respond , but Sveta reached up with a hand .   
Her prosthetic finger tapped the side of the phone .
Moose and Prancer .   
They ’d wrangled three others .   
I did n’t recognize any of the three .   
Bluestocking was way off to the side , just barely in earshot .   
Almost half of Houndstooth
’s
group had turned around and were keeping an eye on Hookline and Kitchen Sink .
“
What brings you here ?
” Prancer asked .
“ Passing through , ” Houndstooth said .
“ To where ?   
This is a peninsula .   
It ’s why Hollow Point is a point .
” Houndstooth shrugged , radiating smug , a lack of concern .
“
The Kings of the Hill .   
You ’re a long way away from where you normally hang out .
”
“
Changing times .   
Some other people might be looking to take over the Hill .
”
“ That does n’t explain why you ’re here , ” Prancer said .
“ Maybe they want to be Kings of the Point , ” Moose said .
“
There ’s nothing to be gained here , ” Prancer said .   
“
It ’ll take you twice as long and
five times as many fights to get half as far .
” Houndstooth laughed .   
One or two members of his group were almost simultaneous in laughing as well , but Houndstooth was louder , more confident , and probably the focus of the camera ’s microphone , to boot .
The villains shifted their footing .   
There were no laughs .   
They did n’t seem impressed .
Houndstooth explained .   
“
You ’re aware you just described an uphill battle to a group called Kings of the Hill ?
”
“
Then you should know all the better , ” Prancer said .   
The force of the response was hampered a bit by the fact that Houndstooth ’s group was chuckling again .
Points to Houndstooth , he was doing pretty well here .   
This was n’t the first time I ’d seen him interact with someone and not really have the presence or power to stand up to the people he was facing down .
“
What a theme .   
The hunting hound , nipping at the fleeing deer ’s heels , ” Houndstooth said .
“ If you ’re going to nip , I ’m going to gore , ” Prancer said .   
“
You ’re not going to come out ahead in this .
”
“
Yeah ?
” Houndstooth asked .   
“
Would you like to have a little skirmish right here ?   
Your eight to our five .   
Or are you going to let us pass through ?
”
“ You ca n’t pass through , ” Prancer said , exasperated .   
“ Its a peninsula .   
You can turn around and go back the way you came , though .
” Houndstooth chuckled .   
He put a hand on a teammate ’s shoulder , and turned the guy around .   
The five members of his group turned to go .
“
Faster response , ” I said .   
I touched the button on the phone to unmute myself .   
“
I ’d like to keep a camera on Prancer ’s group .   
I want to see their response .
”
“
That ’s the plan , ” Tristan ’s voice came through .
A few seconds passed , as Houndstooth ’s team headed back the way they ’d come .
“
I ’m not a mom , ” Sveta said .
“
Okay , ” I said .
There was conversation on the phone .
“
I do n’t want them in here , ” Hookline said .   
“
Fuck that .
”
“ We do n’t know what they ’re doing , ” Prancer said .   
“
It ’s fine .   
Go easy .
”
“ They made a mockery of us .
”
“ They made a mockery of themselves , ” Prancer said .
“ I think you ’re the only one that ’s dwelling on the peninsula thing , ” Velvet said .
“
We ’re fine , ” Prancer said .
“ Were they related to the blonde , Victoria ?
” Moose asked .   
“
Pretty much the first thing I said to her was that she ’d end up outnumbered and having to skedaddle .   
Someone hears that , they might call friends .
”
“ They ’re still outnumbered , ” Velvet pointed out .
Prancer replied , “ I do n’t know , Moose , but yes , we will always have the numbers advantage .   
For now I ’m
content to wait and see what happens .   
If they move in , we have the resources to answer them .   
Bluestocking ?   
Can you tell Bitter Pill
I want to talk to her about her team ?   
I want to keep a closer eye on things .
”
“ I can , ” the woman with glasses said .   
The one that had been collecting protection money .
“
We ’ll be fine , ” Prancer said .
“
What I ’m
wondering , ”
Kitchen Sink said , “ Could this have to do with the truck of- ”
“ Shut up this very second , ” Prancer said .
There was silence .
“
No , ” Prancer said , “ I doubt it does , and you should n’t talk business unless we ’re inside with the Speedrunners or Caveat helping to ensure things are private .
”
“
You ’re doing a lot of talking , ” Sink said .   
“
But I ’m thinking you ’re not doing a lot of doing .   
Those guys walked in and walked out .   
They might come back and they ’ll be a headache .   
Speaking as someone who ’s been collecting rent- ”
“ If you want to talk business , you do it inside , ” Prancer said .
“ -it ’s going to impact that , ” Sink said .   
“ We have to explain .   
You have to explain , really , because I ’m saying fuck this conversation .
”
He punched Hookline lightly in the shoulder , gestured .   
The pair of them turned to walk away .
“ Cracks and clues , ” Tristan ’s voice could be heard over the phone .
“
And two of the locals following Houndstooth ’s group , ” Kenzie reported .   
“
They ’re aiming to catch up .
”
I took off .   
I paused in the air , hand out .
Sveta sent out her hand .   
With the wind currents above the water , the hand moved off - course .   
I flew over to catch it in the same moment she flexed her tendrils and sent the hand to where I ’d been .
We coordinated , I caught her hand before it dropped into the water , and she pulled herself to me .   
She had a silly smile on her face when she drew close .
“
We ’ll work on that , ” I said .
I flew over the water .   
When we reached the first tall building , I dropped Sveta , before changing course again .
She went low to the ground , pulling herself straight to the street level .   
I flew high , to the point where Birdbrain should n’t have a high enough perspective to see me , much like with Kenzie ’s high - flying cameras .
I retrieved my phone .   
“
Do we act ?
”
“ Act , ” Tristan said .
I drew closer .
Hookline ’s hook was out , and Kitchen Sink had a machete in one hand and a gallon tank of probably - kerosene in the other .   
He kept the large red plastic can , tossed away the machete , tossed away the textbook , tossed away the manhole cover-
I was guessing , hoping they wanted to count coup , injure and disappear .
It did n’t seem terribly bright .   
I did n’t want to let them count coup or do worse .   
We ’d made a pledge to Houndstooth ’s group .
Sveta ’s hands appeared out of nowhere , grabbing Hookline by the ankles .   
He fell hard on the initial tug , and was then dragged beneath a parked car .
The hook moved , lashing out .   
It caught on the corner of a building , Hookline ’s attempt to haul himself free .
My focus in the moment was on Kitchen Sink .
I landed so I was a foot behind him , pushing out with my aura .
“ Run , ” I said .
He turned , wheeling around with hand drawn back , a rather large , full bottle of alcohol gripped by the neck-
I smashed my forehead into his nose .   
When he did n’t immediately go down , I did it again .   
I did n’t give him a chance to recover from there .   
My forcefield was down throughout the process , as I stayed within a foot of him , my aura buzzing with the range pulled closer to me , active and focused on him .
I could fly , so I did n’t need footing .   
I used it when I had it , to give a little more oomph when I punched him in the stomach , but at the times I would have needed to pause to get my feet in the right places under me , flight drove me forward .   
Punch , knee to his stomach , a shove against his shoulder , as he drew the connected arm back to swing with the bottle or use his power to throw it point - blank .
He realized he could n’t draw either weapon back , and dropped the plastic jug , jabbing at me instead .   
He hit me in the ribs , and it hurt .
I hit him in the nose , and I was willing to bet it hurt more .
He realized what was happening , and compensated with an exaggerated step back , anticipating he ’d be pushed away , the foot would arrest that movement .
I brought my hand close to his face as I flew up , and he shielded it .
He was trying not to fall down , but with his feet planted far apart-
I flew down , my foot striking on his thigh , close to the pelvis .   
It forced him into awkward almost - splits .
My hand on the back of his head , I pushed his face down toward the road .   
He did n’t try to stop the movement with his arms out , instead folding his around his face , to shield it .
The impact was hard , elbows striking the road , and from the sound he made , his nose hit the arms that were around his face , and that hurt enough .
Sveta had moved across the street .   
She stayed low , and her hand snaked out , snatching for Hookline ’s ankles , trying to once again drag him beneath the vehicle , forcing him to clamber or squeeze out .
As I landed on a car roof , intentionally making a sound , he glanced back at me .   
His face was bound in ripcord or something like it , with a gap for his eyes .   
It pulled his teeth back so they stood out , perpetually bared .
At least he brushed .
The distraction meant Sveta could get a hold on him .   
He stabbed an engine block with the hook , to try to arrest his movement , hands on the chain .
I walked over to the hook , and slapped it free .   
By all rights , I should have destroyed it , but his thing was that he made his weapon invincible , untouchable .
He tried to catch me with it , but Sveta had him and the hook did n’t reach out as fast as Sveta pulled him beneath a dusty construction vehicle .
I collected a mailbox and a pallet of construction material , and set to blocking off his exits , so he would be stuck beneath the truck until someone got him out .
There were others approaching already .
The fastest of them arrived .   
Moose .   
Love Lost .   
A mismatched pair .
Sveta put out her hand , not extending her arm , and I caught it , clasping her wrist as she clasped mine .
Braindead and Birdbrain had no doubt clued in the local villains .   
They would also let people know what Hookline and Sink had been intent on doing .
Others sounded like they were just around the corner .
I glanced at Love Lost .   
The woman who wanted to kill Rain .   
Who wanted to torture him to death .
Rage .   
Anger .   
Hate .
There was so much I did n’t know about that scenario , but I could see that the sentiment was very much real .
Her claw went to her mask .   
I had just about no interest in seeing what she could do .   
I flew skyward and out of reach , bringing Sveta with me .








“ Help me understand how this makes any sense at all , ” Natalie said .
We were outside of a bagel place , close to the station nearest the Wardens’ Headquarters .   
Natalie had bought a salad with chicken bits in it .   
I ’d never liked eating cold chicken , so I ’d picked up a salad without the extras , and a toasted bagel sandwich with fish , black olives , tomatoes and cream cheese .   
We sat at a table outside .
Natalie was wearing a shirt with a folded collar under a work - suitable navy - blue sweater , with black slacks .   
I ’d seen Kenzie wear a similar outfit a few days earlier , though Kenzie had had a skirt , and Kenzie had worn it better .
The group ’s ‘ lawyer’ .   
She was just a student , but mom ’s verdict was that she knew her stuff
well enough to serve , and she had a good sense of what was happening in the future .
I explained , “ The area we were surveilling had a team of heroes come through , at our urging .   
They had a brief interaction with the embedded villain population , suggested they might be sticking around , and then left .
”
“
And they were followed ?   
By the entire group of villains ?
”
“ By two , Hookline and Kitchen Sink , ” I said .   
“
They were angry following the discussion , were previously established as exceedingly violent , and they have criminal acts that are awaiting process .
”
“
They ’re not in the nine percent ?
”
“
Is it nine , now ?   
I was hoping the number would go up , not down .
”
“ Nine now , ” Natalie said .
“ They are n’t .   
I think most of the villains in Cedar Point are trying to stay clear of that line , ” I said .   
I took a bite of my sandwich , then wiped the cream cheese from the corner of my mouth with a flick of my thumb .   
Thoroughly disappointing .
Nine percent .   
I ’d known it as the ten percent , which had been a neater , rounder number .   
With the courts badly behind , only a certain number of crimes and criminals were being rushed through court , and it was n’t based on the time of the deed .   
There was something which might have resembled a balance right now , but it was slipping fast .   
People wanted to focus on getting themselves sorted out , there was plenty of work with reasonable pay , and the people who thought they could game the system ended up falling into the ten percent .   
For those who did , the hammer came down hard and decisively .
There was , however , a population of people who ’d realized they could get away with things if they avoided being among the nine or ten percent worst offenders .   
It seemed to me that the gap was widening as people got more settled in and dissatisfied .   
I knew some areas were using a lottery system to deter the lesser criminals , choosing the crimes they ’d act on and prosecute by drawing them at random .
“
Do you and did you know the crimes these two have awaiting process ?
”
“ Hookline dangled someone out of a fourth story window .   
Witnesses saw .   
He was presumed to be acting as collections for a money lender .   
The neighbors heard shouting about debt , not when Hookline was there , but in general , with the victim and his partner .
”
“
And you know this how , if it was n’t pursued ?
”
“
It was reported on in the paper for that area , a few months ago .   
I have a copy of the article on my laptop .   
I had to take the picture with my phone
so it ’s not the best .   
Do you want to see it ?
” Natalie shook her head .   
“
I ’ll believe you .
”
“
After the article there was a reaction to Hookline .   
Some public gatherings , anger , some backlash against the money lender .   
Hookline left .   
No telling if he was made to , fired , or if he wanted something easier .   
Ended up at Cedar Point .
”
“ And the other one ?   
Kitchen Sink .
”
“ One of a couple who worked under Beast of Burden , who was crime boss for New Haven .   
Sink handled collections for the protection racket .
”
“ Any serious crimes ?
”
“ He trashed one business in a way that made it very clear his power was at use .   
He creates semi - random items and flings them around , and the business had a lot of semi - random items flung around , shelves trashed , windows broken .
”
“ Was anyone hurt ?
”
“
I have no idea , ” I said .   
“ Victim did n’t pursue anything .   
Authorities are n’t going to do anything if the victim is n’t talking .
”
Natalie ’s forehead wrinkled .   
It was a weird contrast for someone who had a whimsical pixie cut with a curl at the front and oversized glasses , to seem as joyless as she did .   
She did n’t seem to like her meal , and she seemed interested but not excited or engaged by this .
I ate more of my bagel sandwich , letting her think .   
It would have been so much better if it was salmon , but it was n’t .   
The olives were mushy and lacked bite , which made me wonder if they were old , scavenged , imitation , or if they ’d lost something in transport .   
The worst thing was the bagel –
I ’d eaten here before and it had been better then .
“ You assaulted and battered two individuals , ” Natalie said .
“
Let me get my laptop out .
”
“ They did n’t make the first move , by your own admission .
”
“
Their intent was clear .   
They had weapons .   
I ’ll show you the video .
”
“ Please .
”
I fished my laptop out of my bag , packed up my bagel and set it aside , and set the laptop down so Natalie could see .   
It was a bit warm from being in my bag and being left on low - energy mode , but the boot - up was fast .   
I already had the pertinent files and videos in a folder .
“
First video , overhead view .   
Do you have headphones ?
”
“ I do .
”
I waited until she had them out .   
She put them on , and I plugged in the jack .   
I hit the spacebar to start the video .   
She watched , putting her arm up and over the top of the screen , to shield it from the sun .   
I offered my own arm to help .   
The video came in at an angle , zooming in , and showed most of the conversation , followed by Hookline and Sink ’s retreat .
When she started to take off her headphones , I held up a finger , then navigated to the second video .   
It showed same events , but a better view of Houndstooth ’s group , and then expanded out to show how Hookline and Sink were closing in .
Natalie watched the fight and the follow - up , with Sveta and I retreating .   
Moose did the work of freeing Hookline from underneath the car I ’d blocked in .
It was hard to see in the noonday sun , especially when I was half - standing , my arm out to help shade the screen , but I could see
Hookline ’s reaction , slapping away Moose ’s hand .   
He stalked off , and Sink belatedly followed , something held to his bleeding nose .
“ Clear intent to injure , ” Natalie said .
“
That ’s what I said .   
I did mention the weapons .
”
“
There ’s a view , and it is n’t my view , ” Natalie said , reaching for her salad , “ that if you have a power then you ’re armed at all times .   
Sometimes judges hold that view .   
I would rather assume that you would have a judge that held that perspective and be wrong , than to assume the opposite and be wrong .
”
“
Right , ” I said .
“ A better option would be to inform the heroes .
”
“
Could n’t .   
Clairvoyants with some clairaudience , ” I said .   
I opened a sub - folder , clicked an image , and let it pop up .   
A boy in a wheelchair , a woman pushing it .   
He wore a helmet with a fake brain under glass at the top .   
She wore a bird mask .   
“
They ’d hear anything we communicated , so it was radio silence .
”
“ You could have dropped down in front of Houndstooth and told him about the situation .
”
“ Similar risk .   
We do n’t want to hint at the prior relationship and we do want to suggest there ’s a growing presence of heroes , to give them reason to second guess .
” Natalie sighed .   
“
I ’m not a very conservative person in reality , but I do think your situation needs a conservative eye .
”
“
I can agree with that , ” I said .
“
With a citizen ’s arrest , there needs to be an actual arrest .   
I recognize you had to leave after the other villains showed up , but normally the process of performing an arrest like that needs clear indication of a crime in progress or one just committed , and it needs the authorities to be involved .
”
“
Citizen ’s arrest ?
” I asked .   
“ Capes get a lot more leeway with those .
”
“
One second .   
The process would be for you to contact me and contact the authorities , before anything happened .
”
I opened my mouth to respond .
“
Where possible , and it was n’t possible here .   
I get that .
”
“
Yes .
”
“ You would , with my counsel and go - ahead , step in , take action , and then wait for the authorities to arrive .
”
“ Authorities who are only acting on nine percent of the cases , ” I said .   
“
Why a citizen ’s arrest and not an arrest with standing ?
”
“
A costumed arrest ?   
We do n’t know for sure if they ’re going to allow those with the new legal system .   
I ’d rather lean on something tidier that we can be fairly sure will carry forward .
”
I leaned back in my seat .   
“
That ’s a lot more conservative than I anticipated .   
Operating as if capes are n’t a thing ?
”
“ I think capes are going to be a thing , ” Natalie said .   
“
But we have reason to believe they ’re going to be a thing people are going to want to handle in a different , more careful way , now .
”
I packed up my sandwich and pitched it into a nearby trash can .
“
No good ?
” Natalie asked .
“ Bagel was flavorless and textureless .   
It looked great and tasted … not like it looked .
”
“ They got popular , so they started freezing excess bagels and defrosting them to serve .
”
I made a face .
“
We ’re making strides , Victoria , but I think we ’re in for a culture shock when people realize that as much as they ’ve been waiting eagerly for things to get closer to normal , we ’re not going to get a lot of the old normal we ’re eager for , and we ’re going to get some of the less pleasant parts .
”
“ You ’re talking about the law ?
” Natalie shrugged .   
She was holding her plastic thing of salad , spearing some with a plastic fork .   
Before popping it into her mouth , she said , “ Lots of stuff .
”
My laptop was taking up some of her table real - estate , so I closed it and pulled it closer to me .
“ Expectations , ” she said , once she was done swallowing .   
“
If I ’m working with you , I need to know what yours are .
”
“
That ’s a simple question with an answer that could take me a day to get through .
”
“
Your mom wanted me to ask you if you were still looking for work , ” Natalie said .
I tensed a little .
“
I was asked to ask the question and pass on the response if you gave it .
”
“ When we pay you , it ’s not for you to be a messenger between me and my mom .   
If I want to talk to her
I can call her .
”
“ Okay , ” Natalie said .   
“
She had something else to pass on .
”
“
And I ’m not interested ,
” I said , my voice firmer .   
“ Thank you .   
I will get up and walk away .
”
“ Please do n’t .   
Really , please do n’t .   
There are a lot of things I want to talk about sooner than later , ” she said .   
“
During our last meeting , I know it was brief , but I wanted the lay of the land .   
I was hoping this meeting would be a chance to get a more comprehensive sense of what you wanted to do , and
what I ’m doing for you .   
Both of your mother ’s questions tie into that .
”
“
Did you talk to her about our meeting ?
”
“
No .   
Not for the last one .   
For this one , I went to someone lateral to her .   
She approached me independently with these things , and told me to reach out to you if you did n’t reach out anytime soon .   
Because you would want to know .
” I wished I had n’t thrown my lunch away .   
I would ’ve liked to have something to violently toss into the wastebasket , as an outlet for what I was feeling .   
I shook my head a little .
“
It ’s relevant , ” Natalie said .   
“
And it ’s important .   
I promise .
”
I shook my head more .   
All around us , people were going to and from lunch .   
There was actually a city - like stream of cars on the road toward the center of the megalopolis proper .
“
Tell me then , ” I said .
“ There were two attempted breaches into our email server last night .   
It looked like it was directed at your mother .   
They put a moratorium on sending and receiving email for three hours while they did some backend stuff , and there was another attempted breach partway through that .   
Tech people are looking into it .
” I nodded .   
I looked at my laptop .   
Cedar Point , except I was n’t aware of anyone who would be especially good at that stuff there .   
The speedrunners were tinkers , but nothing suggested they were tinkers with talents that translated to hacking into the email servers in the Wardens’ headquarters .   
Bitter Pill was a full tinker , but her specialty put her even further from that kind of operation .
Houndstooth appears , adding to pressure , Sveta and I make our appearance , and a little while later , an attempted look at a close relation ’s emails .   
I could see the thread .
Would Tattletale have succeeded ?   
If she had the power to see weaknesses , it could extend to security systems .   
During the bank robbery , she ’d done something to gain access , though I could n’t remember particulars .   
It had been ambient noise around then .   
She ’d also collected info on Empire Eighty - Eight .
Someone they hired ?   
Was the fact that they did n’t go straight to Tattletale important ?   
A sign of a schism ?
“
My mother thinks it has something to do with me , ” I concluded .
“
She was called in for confidential discussion this morning
, she got out of the meeting , said she could n’t get in touch with you , and told me to reach out .   
I think so
, yeah .
”
“ I ca n’t have you being her messenger .   
It ’d impact how this arrangment works , ” I said .
“
Even if it ’s pertinent ?   
Letting you know things like the possible breach into emails ?   
That they ’re looking into people close to you ?
”
“
The problem is that it ’s always going to sound like a good reason .
”
“
Could it sound like a good reason because it is one ?   
Sometimes , even ?
”
I drew in a deep breath .   
I collected my laptop and put it into my bag .
“
Do n’t leave , please .   
I do n’t want to drive you away .   
I do want to understand , ” Natalie said .   
“
The first and last thing I said at our last meeting was that I was concerned .   
I ’m more concerned now .
”
“
Why ask me about whether I was looking for work ?
”
“
Because she asked me to ask you , if I thought it was appropriate , and I thought it might be .
”
“ Of fucking course , ” I said .
“ Do n’t get angry , ” Natalie said .
“
I ’m not angry with you .
”
“ Before we got derailed , I was talking about expectations .   
You flew into that scene with no hesitation .
”
“ I ’m invincible , ” I said .   
A lie , yes , but I was n’t about to trust her with the truth .
“
I know that , but is n’t there always some risk you ’ll be hurt , or that there will be some consequence ?   
You ’re paying me , you ’re involving your family , and the hack could be the tip of the iceberg .   
I have to wonder , how much are you putting into this ?
”
“ I know my own limits , Natalie .
”
“
Are you looking for work ?
”
“
Are you going to report to my mother and tell her if I ’m not ?
”
“
No , ” Natalie said .   
“
And I ’m offended that you ’d ask .
”
“ I ’ve been pulling occasional shifts here and there doing cape work .   
Keeping the peace at protests , standing guard here or there , in the general vicinity of cape functions .   
I volunteer too .
”
“
Is the volunteer stuff as a cape ?
” I sat back in my chair , and shifted the position of my bag .   
“
Yeah .   
Pretty much .
”
“ It does n’t seem like much of a balance .
”
“
You ’re aware I ’ve never had that balance ?
”
I asked , in my best ‘ get real’ tone .
“ You went to high school once upon a time , did n’t you ?
”
“ As the girl that was an out and open superheroine , ” I said .   
“
Because of a decision my parents made .
”
“
I have n’t seen my dad in years .   
I do n’t even know if he survived .   
I know what it ’s like to have parent issues , ” Natalie said .   
“ I do get it .   
But is this really what you want ?   
Your mother is concerned-
”
I grit my teeth .
“
-I’m concerned .   
I can definitely see the similarities between you two .   
You ’re both firm in your convictions and it seems like you both give things your all .   
She ’s usually the first one in and the last one out at work .
”
“ Can we stop talking about my mom ?
” I asked .   
Angrier than I ’d intended .
“
Okay , ” Natalie said .   
She stopped there .   
“ Give me a second .   
I ’ll compose my thoughts .
”
I gave her a few seconds .   
My ankle crossed over the other , and the top foot tapped against the ground .   
My fingers fidgeted with the strap of the bag that laid against my chair .
“
I ’m your lawyer .   
For you and your team .
”
“
Not my team .   
Just a team I ’m looking after .
”
“
There ’s an implication of overseeing and ownership , but okay .   
I ’m the lawyer .   
I can give you counsel , and if I know who you are and who you want to be , I can tailor that counsel .   
My tendency is to be conservative , because there ’s a lot we do n’t and wo n’t know .
” I nodded .   
“
There ’s a degree to which I want conservative .
”
“ I hear you .   
I would strongly encourage something more lawful .   
Calling first , letting authorities know , checking with the lawyer , doing what you ’ll do , working with authorities after .
”
“
Not every situation allows for that .   
Having a plan is great , and I ’m all about laying stuff out and being smart about things .   
Sometimes there ’s no time , and you have to make choices .
”
“
Yes , ” Natalie said .   
She paused , fixing her glasses .   
“
Yes .   
If these are the three stages of the plan , with prelude , action , follow - up , maybe you can skip one , and you can explain it away to the authorities .
” I nodded .   
“
That ’s not unreasonable .
”
“
Except …    If you have to skip two and rush the other , is it possible that you should n’t have acted at all ?
”
“ We should have just let Houndstooth ’s group get attacked from behind ?
”
“ Or waited to send them in , ” Natalie suggested .   
“ Or not had them come in at all , if you could n’t be sure you ’d be able to handle the lead - in and follow - up .
” I drummed my fingers on the table .   
“
There ’s more to it .   
These guys are in contact with people .   
If we let them operate as normal , try to catch them in the act , they ’ll use their leverage and catch us first .   
We have to apply some sustained pressure .   
Test their relationship with their contacts .   
We ’ve talked it over with other groups and they agree it makes a degree of sense .
”
“
Houndstooth ?
”
“ They were one .   
They really liked it , even .
”
Natalie ’s brow wrinkled .   
“
You said sustained .   
Do you have more lined up ?
”
“ A team is going to call a local realtor , looking into the possibility of moving in .   
We ’ll see if they react .
”
“
Then ?
” she asked .
“ We might have some more people lined up .   
Another group might be passing through , and we ’ll be more ready if something comes up .   
My cousin is swinging by .
”
More brow wrinkles .   
“
You ’ll pressure them until they crack .
”
“ Until they start to .   
Then we or someone we trust targets that weak point .
”
“ When things crack , it ’s often sudden .   
Hook and Sink would be an example of that .
” I nodded .
“ If it ’s sudden , it ’s hard to take the necessary steps before and after , ” Natalie said .
“
It could be , ” I said .
“ You do n’t have to give me an answer right now , but please think about what you want this to be .   
You can act faster and more flexibly if you ’re loose with the law , but you ’ll lose your chance at getting a big success past a judge ’s desk .   
I can help you if that ’s the route you need to go .
”
“
But you think we should n’t go that way .
”
“ The people on the team are young , so you need to think about what you ’re teaching them .   
You need to think about your balance of real life and cape life .
”
“
I ’m
not-
” I started .   
“
I never got that .   
Even before I had powers , the cape life had taken over .
”
“ I can understand why you would resent her for that ,
but- ” “
That ’s not it , ” I said .
She sat there , waiting like she was expecting me to elaborate .
I almost got angry .   
I pushed that back .
“
I ’m not going to get into particulars , ” I said , calm .   
“
It ’s between me and her , and it would make things messy .   
Nobody benefits from that .   
Least of all you .
”
“ I ’ll take your word for it .
”
“
Thank you , ” I said .   
“
I ’ll think about what you said .   
About what I want , what I ’m doing , keeping an eye out for balance .   
The team and what they need .
”
“ The kind of counsel you need me to be .
”
“
Yes , ” I said .   
“
Absolutely .   
But I need something from you too .
” Natalie nodded .
“
Do n’t involve my mother in this .   
Do n’t pass on information , give hints , or respond to hints .   
Lawyer - client confidentiality should be in effect .
”
“
I ’m not a lawyer , exactly .   
I can and do intend to do that ,
absolutely , but- ” “ Act like one , here .   
Please .   
She ’ll convey her side of the story , probably not in an obvious way , and I need you to be neutral .   
I wo n’t be sharing my side , but assume I have one .
”
“ Okay , ” Natalie said .
“ I ca n’t get into that stuff .   
I ca n’t afford to , ” I said .
“ She does care about you , you know , ” Natalie said .   
“
She might not handle it in the best way , I do n’t know the details , but I know that she is smart and caring , and both of those things are magnified when it comes to you .
”
I stared at her .   
My first thought was that I wanted to strangle her , because of the frustration I felt even before what I ’d just said , her going against it , and how she seemed to not get it at all .   
Even with an absent parent ?   
I wondered if it was something wholly different , like a parent that had left and cut contact of their own volition , rather than a parent that she ’d cut herself off from .
My second thought was to tell Natalie what my mother had done , and to hope she understood .   
Even if I knew it would blow things up , cause chaos , screw up Natalie
’s relationship with a superior .
I could see the worry on her forehead , as she looked at me .   
In that look , I could see that I was the bad guy here .   
I was the one Natalie thought she had to worry about , and my mother was the smart , capable , caring professional .
Anything I did in reaction to this would only make me seem more unreasonable .
“
Thank you for meeting with me , ” I said , pushing the emotion back , doing my best to sound normal .   
“ Are phone payments okay ?
”
“ They are , ” Natalie said .
I took a minute to get everything sorted out , glad to have something to focus on , then tapped my phone against hers .
Sixty dollars out of my account .   
A glance at the screen verified my account standing .   
I had two hundred for rent to Crystal , seventy five for utilities .   
Even before any possible temp jobs in costume , I had enough to get through next month , two or three more meetings with Natalie or even fewer with anyone we replaced her with .   
Natalie was cheap and willing and I did n’t disagree with her non - family related advice .   
It made sense .
“
Thank you , ” she said .   
“
And thank you for lunch .
”
“
I ’ll see you later , ” I said .
She was the pawn , not the problem .   
My mother had chosen her for a reason .   
A play of a sort , possibly unintentional or automatic .   
It was n’t a play my mom had made because she was a mastermind , natural or otherwise .   
It was just how she was , how she navigated people .   
Everyone close to her had had to learn how to deal with it .
The tragedy was that as much as it was a conscious or unconscious bid for a reconnection with me , it would achieve the opposite .
I put my music on , and walked to the nearest bit of park so I could take off without causing too much of a commotion .
⊙ I let myself into the headquarters .   
I was secretly glad to find I was n’t the first person in , seeing Kenzie at the desk , wearing the same clothes from yesterday .
As that fleeting sentiment passed , I was alarmed , seeing Kenzie at the desk , wearing the same clothes from yesterday .
“ Kenzie ?
” I asked .
“
Oh !
”
I heard her speak , though she did n’t move .   
Kenzie - at - the - desk winked out of existence .
“ …
Kenzie ?
” I tried again .
“
I ’m on my way !
”
she said , through the computer speaker .   
“
I was hooked in by phone and forgot I had a virtual me set up to appear if I called .   
It ’s only half done .   
I ’ll be there soon !   
How are you ?
”
“
Do n’t dive too deep into the team stuff or tinkertech , Kenzie , ” I said .   
“ Take a break , turn off your brain every once in a while .
”
“ I turn off my brain by tinkering , ” she said .   
“
It ’s like how on some computers you can push the number so high it goes back to zero ,
except it ’s brain activity .
”
“ Kenzie , ” I said .   
“ Put the phone away .   
Close your eyes .   
Do n’t fuss about things .
”
“ But-
”
“ Is there an emergency ?
”
“
No . ”
“ Then hang up , put the phone away , close your eyes , and do n’t worry .   
Everyone ’s coming , we ’ll tackle some things , compare notes , and all will be good .
”
“ Bye .
”
“ Bye Kenzie .   
See you soon .
”
“
In … twelve minutes .   
About .   
And Rain is coming , but he ’s going to be later .   
He ’ll arrive in-
”
“
Hang up the phone , ” I said .   
“
Or I ’m going to start unplugging things at random .
”
“ Bye then .
” I did n’t respond , because it was apparent that Kenzie had to get the last word .   
The ambient noise came through the phone for another few seconds before she hung up .   
The cube to the right of her desk went dark .
It was strange to be in the space when the others had yet to arrive .   
Normally , my focus was on the task at hand , here .   
I wanted to be the rock , unmovable , in case others needed to reach out .   
It was hard to be that with Natalie ’s words in my mind and the room empty .
The whiteboards were people ’s thoughts encapsulated .   
Mine was numbers to call , things to do , a rough timeline of events , with the next being Auzure ’s call to Cedar Point .   
They were Houndstooth
’s recommendation .   
I added notes about the hack .
Kenzie had her costume notes , tinker notes , some drawings in erasable marker of her face , a circle with large eyes , a kiss - shaped mouth , and two buns , and various hearts and stars .   
She had two boards , one mounted on the wall behind the one with two legs and four wheels , and the tinker notes spilled out from the side of the one in front to the one in the back .   
So did the stars and hearts , for that matter .
Chris’ was at the other end , opposite her desk .   
I walked over to it , glancing at the others on the way .   
There were some names written down , but most had been erased .
Menagerie 
 Zoo 
 Zoological or Zoologic ? 

Hodgepodge or Hodge ?   
Podge ?
Note to self : bring books for Rain All written in the bottom left corner .   
‘ Chris’ was in the top right corner , the ‘ h’ smudged where a sleeve had rubbed up against it mid - write .
Ashley ’s board was empty , except for a very elaborate , stylized rendition of her name .   
Kenzie had found some fonts and displayed them on the whiteboard for tracing .   
Ashley had okayed this one .
Just ‘ Ashley’ .   
Nothing else figured out .
Rain had two boards , like Kenzie .   
One on wheels , another on the wall behind .   
Unlike Kenzie , they were n’t even remotely organized by topic .   
Snag , Love Lost , Cradle , ‘ 5’ , known acquaintances , tinker hands , contact pads , timeline for Snag ’s operations , known places the cluster had been with lines drawn to names of acquaintances , name ideas with ‘ handbreak’ crossed out because Tristan had apparently vetoed it , a crude calendar with the names of cluster members filling in blanks , Love Lost due tonight … and so on .
Just red marker and some brown , presumably to put in different words in gaps yet keep them distinct .   
Or because Kenzie had stolen the red marker to draw hearts .
Tristan ’s was next to Rain ’s , and Tristan ’s was mostly devoted to team name ideas , room layouts , broader organization and schedule , and some minor notes on money spent .   
Byron had n’t really showed up in the hideout , but Tristan had still devoted a quarter of the board to him .   
A list of movies .   
Aimed at letting Byron maintain a degree of communication with Chris and Rain , it seemed , from the comments on the side .
Sveta was taken up by a mix of art and names .   
She ’d written out names not in a list , but as solitary words .   
Images had been drawn around them .   
Beneath ‘ Moor’ , a girl ’s hair , wavy , with a fish head poking out to the right from between the two curtains of hair .   
It was very detailed for art on a whiteboard , with each scale getting a texture .   
Above ‘ Lash’ was a feminine figure in stark black lines with back arched , head back , and breasts pointed skyward , the breasts so pointed they could have been used for Kenzie ’s geometry homework .   
To the right of ‘ Cirrus’ was a face drawn out in lines , frowning .   
‘ Berth’ was sitting in the bottom right corner in tiny text .   
The image was so small
it was barely legible .   
It might have been Sveta ’s rendition of herself , potato - shaped with arms and legs flailing .   
A line was drawn between its head and the word ‘ no’ , a speech bubble without the bubble .
I felt oddly fond at seeing it .   
That kind of mental working was inexplicable to me , but I liked seeing the hints of it .
After Sveta was my whiteboard , neatly organized , then Kenzie ’s two , which I ’d already noted .
I wanted to help them .
No .   
The boards did n’t convey it , the boards were things as they should be , even , but they needed help .
On so many levels , they needed help .
The by - proxy interaction with my mother had affected my mood .   
Natalie ’s words and concerns had too , but it was hard to know how many of those were my mother
’s and
how many were her .
The concern ,   with emphasis on the word like I could remember Ashley doing …   
Even after I ’d been hurt by the Nine , had worse done to me by my sister , and gone to the hospital , I could n’t remember my mother ever expressing concern for my activities as a cape .   
If such was expressed in Natalie ’s expression and words , then I could believe it was Natalie ’s .
Concern for what I was doing , the path I was walking ?   
I could see it being my mother
’s , through Natalie - as - proxy .
It made me sad and angry and frustrated all at the same time , and I did n’t have any outlets for that .   
The punching bag had n’t yet arrived and been set up , and I was n’t about to throw myself at the villains .   
Not that I wanted to operate that way .
The villains were so simple , so easy .   
Cedar point .   
Bad guy central .   
I was supposed to dislike what they did
and I did dislike it .   
I did n’t see anything redeeming in them , I had the power to stop them , and I wholly planned to .   
If I could mess with Tattletale in the process ?   
Bad guy , I was supposed to dislike her , she ’d done little that redeemed her , and it was personal , besides ?   
Yeah .   
Fuck yes .   
But I ’d do it smart , not by impulse .
Others … not so easy .   
My dad .   
Gilpatrick .   
Mrs. Yamada , even .   
They were the good guys and they had n’t handled things perfectly .   
I felt varying degrees of heartbreak because of them
but I could n’t blame them .   
Not easy .
My life was filled with people I wanted to get angry at and could n’t , because they were fundamentally broken and flawed .   
My mother .   
My sister .   
Amelia .   
Amy .   
I ’d said her name and thought about her for ten lifetimes’ worth , in just the span of two years .   
I felt vaguely ill that I was doing so now , even if it was for the sake of doing as Natalie had asked me to .
The only thing I hated more than being victim to other people ’s emotional impulses and fucked - upness was when those other people were so close to me that it all came down on my head .   
The furthest thing from easy .
The door opened , interrupting my thoughts .   
I turned my head to see .
Sveta and Ashley .   
Tristan absent , even though he would normally catch the same train .
“
Hi , ” I said .
“
What are you doing standing in the dark ?   
At least turn the lights on , ” Sveta chided me .
“
There ’s more than enough light from the windows , ” I said .   
“
It ’s bright out .
”
“ I ’d expect that behavior from Ashley , not you , ” Sveta said .
“ Sounds right , ” Ashley said .
Sveta flicked the switch , looking up as the lights took their time coming on .   
It made me think of my mom .   
Turning on the lights , even when not strictly necessary .   
I could remember visiting friend ’s houses and feeling like something was odd when other parents did n’t do it .
“
What are you doing ?
” Sveta asked .
“
Thinking .
”
“
Uh oh . ”
“ Constructive thinking .   
I think .   
I hope .   
Had a chat with Natalie .
”
“
Uh oh , ” Sveta said , again , as she sidled up to me .
I gave her a light push .   
She smiled , righted herself , and half - stepped , half - stumbled right next to me .   
She gave me a hug from behind , setting her chin on my shoulder .
Familiar sensation , there , in an eerie not - familiar way .
“
Tristan ’s walking the sprogs , ” Sveta said .   
“ Rain ’s late .
”
“ Kenzie mentioned , ” I said .   
“
The second part .   
Sprogs ?
”
“ Chris and Kenzie .   
I thought it was clever .
”
“
It was .
”
She nodded , head moving against my shoulder .   
“
You ’re looking at the boards ?
”
I gestured in the direction of the whiteboards .   
“ Natalie wants to know our mission statement , so she can fine - tune her advice .   
She wanted a lot of things , some harder to put into words than others .   
I ’m looking at the whiteboards , trying to figure out what the thread is and how I can help .
”
“
Your board is empty , Ashley , ” Sveta said .
“
So ?
”
“
Are you going to call yourself Damsel of Distress ?
” I asked .   
“
For that matter , what are you doing , costume - wise ?
”
“ If you ’re going to tell me not to wear a dress while I ’m out with you all , you can fuck off , ” Ashley said .
“ Not wearing a dress could help with the Manton issues .   
You ’re more likely to use your power to blow up the edge of a flapping dress than the part that hugs your body .
”
“ You can fuck off , ” she said , again .
“ Ashley likes dresses , ” Sveta said .   
“
We ’ve had conversations about it .   
She thinks I should wear some , and I ’ve had to repeatedly reinforce that I do n’t have the legs for it , because I do n’t have legs .
”
“ They multiply a lady ’s grace , ” Ashley said .
“ You ca n’t exaggerate a negative , ” Sveta said .
“
You ’re attached to the image , ” I observed .
“
Obviously , ” Ashley said , turning to face me .
She was attached to just that image .   
I was n’t sure if she had multiple versions of the same dress , but she did n’t change things up much .   
She had , however , bought the new dress in Cedar Point , and we ’d seen on camera as she considered nail polish .
She wanted to change , maybe .   
But … how long had she stuck to this style ?   
I ’d fancied taking Sveta shopping , but now I was intrigued by this puzzle .
“
It ’s a shame
you damage your dresses , ” I said .   
I indicated the hem of her dress .   
“
Are you learning to tailor or do you hire someone ?
”
“
I ’m studying it .   
Saves me money .
”
“
Okay , so … I have a bit of a crazy idea , ” I said .
She narrowed her eyes .
“
Bear with me , ” I said .
“ Bear with her , ” Sveta said .   
“ Victoria knows fashion .
”
“
You ’re leading up to this like you know I ’ll hate it .
” I nodded .
“ Out with it , then , ” Ashley said .
“ Hair , ” I said .
“
No , ” was the response , without a beat missed .
“ I ca n’t promise it would work , but hair can confuse the Manton effect .   
It might be that the power gets confused because it ’s a part of your identity and a part of you , but it ’s not alive either .   
There are parahumans who impregnate their costumes with hair to make them resistant to their own powers .   
There are some who have costumes that are just hair , or mostly hair , but those are pretty scanty , as you can probably imagine .
”
“ I think I ’ve heard of that parahuman , ” Sveta said .   
When I arched an eyebrow , she said , “ The hair impregnation thing .
”
“ I ’m not going to cut it off , ” Ashley said .
“
That ’s fine .   
I ’m not
even sure it would work , and it would be a shame to do it if it did n’t .
”
She nodded .
“ You could try saving the hairs that come free while you ’re sleeping or brushing your hair , ” I said .
“ How much would I need ?
” Ashley asked .
“ If it did work , you might not even need much .   
A strand every quarter - inch or so , along the length , or along the parts that are likely to get clipped by your power .   
Maybe a bit more .
”
“
And it ’d be white hairs on a black background , ” she said .
“ You could , you know , not wear black ?
” I ventured .
“ I like black , ” she said .   
“
It ’s elegant .   
It works .   
The black dress every woman has in her closet for occasions is black for a reason .
” I was actually enjoying myself , because of the puzzle , and because it was my longest interaction with Ashley that had n’t come to blows .
“
Dye it ?
” Sveta asked .
“ Does n’t work , ” Ashley said .   
“
I have natural silver - blonde hair , but I use my power-
”
She put her hand to the side of her head and used her power .   
I stepped back , stumbled into Sveta , then reached out to help her catch her balance .
Ashley ’s hair settled back into place .   
Her pupils took a long few seconds to reappear .
The door swung open .   
It was Tristan , looking alarmed .
“
We good , ” Sveta said .
“ My eyes and hair lose their color , ” Ashley said , in a non - sequitur for Tristan .
“
You ’d lose the dye , ” I said .   
“
Probably .
”
Kenzie and Chris appeared behind Tristan .   
He let them in .
“
What happened ?
” Chris asked .
“
Talking fashion , ” Sveta offered .
“
Which involves reality - shattering explosions , naturally , ” Chris said .   
He grinned .
He was wearing a newer t - shirt , with a gorn - metal band ’s album cover on the front .   
Not my style .   
He was broader around the middle , but I diplomatically avoided mentioning it .
“
You ’re taller , ” I observed .
“ One and a half inches taller , ” Chris said .
“
He went with the indulgence thing yesterday , ” Tristan said .
“
Yeah , ” Chris said .   
“
I knew there was a risk I might be useless for the day , putting myself in a state where I just sit around , eat , play games .   
So I fucked off .   
I ’ll hit anxiety a few times in the next while , but I ’ll make it mad twitchiness
so there ’s some more motive behind it , instead of it being paralyzing .   
That ’ll be fun .
”
“
That sounds like you ’re going overboard .   
Should n’t you be balancing things out ?
” I asked .
“ Should n’t you be minding your own business ?
” Chris asked .   
“
Go talk fashion .   
I ’m fine .
”
He walked over to his corner , near where his whiteboard was .   
Kenzie moved to follow , and Chris turned around , reached out to grab her by the shoulders , and turned her to face us , before going back on his way , to his whiteboard .
“ Fashion , ” Tristan said .   
“
Okay .   
We ’ve got some stylish and artsy people here .   
I ’m not so up there on girl - fashion , but I ’ll contribute what I can .
”
“ Ashley is married to this look , ” I said .
“
Married is the wrong word , ” Ashley said .
“
How would you put it ?
” Sveta asked .
“
A long time ago , when I was still finding my way , I did n’t even have the clothes on my back , not intact ones .   
I had no friends , no family , and law enforcement was after me .   
I had nothing .   
I spent a lot of time thinking about who and what I wanted to be .   
Characters I liked , clothes I liked , people I ’d thought were elegant and imposing .   
I found this .   
I built this , ” Ashley said .
What had her role models been , for aesthetics ?   
Cartoon movie villains ?   
Evil sorceresses and witches ?
“
When you had nothing , you found this , and you want to hold onto that , ” Sveta said .   
“
I can understand that .   
I hold onto things that were important to me once .
”
“ Like Weld , ” Kenzie said .
“ Among others , ” Sveta said , giving me more of a hug .
“
I do n’t want to hold onto anything , ” Ashley said .   
“
I am that .   
People spend their entire lives trying to find the right image for themselves
and I found it when I was Kenzie
’s
age .
”
“ I do n’t think you ’re going to win this one , Victoria , ” Tristan said .
“ Theoretically speaking , ” I started .
“
Alright .   
I ’m getting out of the line of fire , ” Tristan said .
“
Do n’t be mean , ” Kenzie said .
“
Call with Auzure in a short bit .   
Rain might miss it , ” Tristan said .
“
Theoretically speaking … can I put something out there ?
” I asked .
“
Can I stop you ?
” Ashley asked .
“ Tell me to
and I ’ll stop right here .   
You can do your thing .
”
Sveta rocked her head left and right on my shoulder , chin digging in , until I shrugged her off .   
Ashley considered .
“
Theoretically , ” Ashley said .
“
Theoretically , ” I picked up the prompt , “ You ’re going to be a hero .   
You have a crystal clear image of what you ’ll look like as a villain .   
Your every expectation is that you ’ll stop being a hero at one point and return to villainy .
”
“
That ’s not theory .   
That ’s fact .
”
“
But what is theory is … what if , to avoid your hero self and villain self getting mixed up , you tried something different , in the here and now ?   
It keeps your villain persona distinct .
”
Ashley folded her arms .
“
Different
how ?   
I get the impression you have something in mind , ” Sveta said .
“ Pshht ! ”
Ashley made the sound , shushing Sveta .
“
Do n’t pshht me .
”
“
What if , theoretically , ” I said , “ You cut off the hair ?   
White hair for a white costume .   
You can still do something with black accents here and there , but we can go more … white goth .   
Or something in that vein .
”
“
I ’m not goth , ” Ashley said .   
“
And I ’m not cutting my hair .
”
“
Theoret-
” I started .
I saw her expression change .
More seriously , I said , “ You cutting your hair could be a commitment .   
You could go back to being the long - haired villainess , but only after a period of time .   
You ’d be locking yourself into being a hero in the meantime .
”
“
A hair - based time commitment , ” Sveta said .
“
There ’s no reason to do it , ” Ashley said .   
“
To preserve my costume ?   
For that minor gain , I ’m supposed to risk looking like a simpleton ?   
No .
”
“
What kind of black accents ?
” Kenzie asked .
“
No , ” Ashley said .
“ Black around the eyes , like heavy eyeliner , maybe decoration in the hair , or as part of the mask , something to frame the edges of sleeves and dress .
” Kenzie went still .   
She gave Ashley a sidelong glance .
“
What ? ”
Ashley asked .
“
Back before Mrs. Yamada told me I was n’t supposed to give anyone a birthday present
, I was thinking about what to get you .
”
“ If Mrs. Yamada said no , then there ’s probably a reason , ” I said .
“ The group was new and Ashley
and I were only just starting to talk ,
so it would ’ve been weird , I think .   
It would n’t be for just Ashley either , it ’d be for the group .
”
“
Spit it out , ” Ashley said .
“
Eyes , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I can put these things in your mask and it would project over your eyes .   
We could have you wear a white costume , and then there would be bits that are black , and then we could make your eyes totally , one hundred percent black , or totally white .
”
“
Hold up , ” I said .
Kenzie turned my way .
“
When you say something like ‘ I can make this’ , I have to ask … how easily ?
”
“ Super easily .   
A few hours easy , ” Kenzie said .   
When I did n’t shut her down , she turned to Ashley , “ We could have it so smoke comes off of your eyes and trails behind you as you walk .   
or blurry light , like when you wave a sparkler in the dark , or particles , like shapes , or blurs like your power makes , or-
” Ashley put a hand on top of Kenzie ’s head .   
Kenzie stopped talking .
“
Do you want to ?   
Do you like it ?
”
“ If I went to buy you a gift , to balance it out , so it was equal , what would you want ?
”
“ Went ?   
I do n’t want you to go anywhere .
”
“ I meant some other time .
”
“
No gift , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Hang out .   
Talk with me .   
Come on , we can use your whiteboard .   
We ’ll talk and take notes , and figure out what your costume might be .   
Let me search for things on my phone- ” Kenzie took Ashley ’s hand and led her to the whiteboard , tugging her along .   
Ashley did n’t object too much along the way .
Near Kenzie ’s computers , Tristan had his arms folded , his eyebrow raised .   
Sveta had her head cocked to one side as she studied me .   
Chris was dumping his bag out on his little table .
“
She ’s not hard to figure out or anything ,
” I said , quiet enough that only Sveta would hear me .   
“
At one point she said we were pretty similar people .
”
“
That leaves me with way more questions than answers , ” Sveta said .
Tristan called out , “ Do n’t get too into it , you two !   
We ’re listening in on the call with Auzure soon !
”
Ashley raised a hand , waving him off .   
Kenzie was just nonstop background chatter now .
“
What are you thinking ?
” Sveta asked .   
“
You ’re introspective today .
”
“ Extraspective , right this moment , ” I said .   
“
Thinking about the big picture .
”
“ Think out loud .
” I shrugged .   
“ The team .   
How it fits together .   
How I fit into it .
”
“
A bit of introspection then .
”
“
No , not exactly , ” I said , the thought clarifying as I said it .   
“
How ’s Weld doing ?
”
“ If he could get tired he ’d be dog tired .   
I need to have a talk with him soon , before things get to a point where I do n’t see him ever , ” Sveta said .   
“
I hate to add anything to his plate , but I have to be assertive .
”
“
I ’m glad you have him , ”
I said .
Sveta smiled .   
“
I ’m
glad I have him too .   
Even if he ’s tired and gone most of the time .   
Why are you asking about him ?
”
“
When Jessica- When Mrs. Yamada asked me to sit in with the group and help out .   
She asked Weld first , did n’t she ?
”
“
Ah , you caught that , ” Sveta said .   
The smile disappeared .   
“
I ’m sorry .   
I was n’t sure if you did , and I did n’t want to risk hurting your feelings .
”
“
Was I second choice ?
” I asked .
“ I do n’t think so .   
Sorry , I do n’t know for sure , but Weld was asked and he said no , but he said he ’d be free a little while after .   
She could have waited and had Weld sit in , but she chose you .
”
“
And she seemed okay , almost relieved , at me doing this , ” I said .
“
As okay as she is with any of this , ” Sveta said .
The display on the wall lit up .   
The trill of the phone filled the room .
“
They ’re calling us first , ” Tristan said .   
“ Everyone come .   
Seems like Rain is going to miss this .   
Sucks .
”
We gathered at the desk .
“ We need something to call you , ” the woman ’s voice on the other line said .   
“ Dido speaking , with Auzure .
”
“ Dido , this is Capricorn .   
You ’re on speaker with most of the rest of the team listening in .   
We ’re working on the team name .   
We ’ll have something soon .
”
“ I wanted to go over the particulars , make sure we do this right .   
We ’re going to be calling …
” I mostly tuned it out .   
Tristan had it handled , and it was n’t rocket science .   
I was n’t that fond of Auzure , either .
Natalie had asked me what I was doing .
I ’d been asked to be here .   
I was damaged , and Mrs. Yamada knew it .   
Why was I here , then ?   
Yesterday , I might have said it was so I could provide this kind of direction and guidance .   
So I could talk to the lawyer , handle situations like Kenzie ’s and Ashley ’s , and be a friend to Sveta .
Was I right ?   
Thinking that Yamada had felt like she ’d done her job in putting me here ?   
Was I overthinking things after my talk with Natalie , paranoia rearing its ugly head again ?
“
Beautiful , ” Dido said .   
“
Should we conference you in ?
”
“
No , ” Tristan said .   
“
We ’ve got a number you can call , it ’ll route through to them , and it wo n’t be as blatant as a conference call .
”
“
Lovely .   
I wondered if I should mention something .   
Good to work with people who know what they ’re doing .   
What number ?
”
Sveta mouthed the word ‘ slimy’ at me .
Water off my back , now .   
I ’d just dealt with my mom
and this was easy by comparison .
Tristan gave the number , and the call was terminated .
He checked his phone .
“ Rain wants to know if people are okay with him inviting Erin .   
They ’re still half an hour away .   
She gave him a ride and they stopped along the way .   
He says he ’s safe , no trouble , but he wants to talk , and he wants her here when he does .
”
Tristan ’s voice was just a bit tight .
“
I have suspicions , ” Sveta said .
“ I know , I think , ” Tristan said .
With that , I felt like the musings crystallized .   
I would n’t know until I talked to Jessica , but I had more of an idea .   
Things made a degree of sense .
“ Not here , ” I said .
“
Hm ?
” Tristan asked .








“ Hello ?   
This is Andre Giannone .
”
“ Andre , hello .   
We were hoping you could help us out .   
We want to rent some locations in Cedar Point .
”
“
Where did you get this number ?
”
“ We went to the source .   
Mortari Construction handled the building in Cedar Point , and they gave us the name of … Andrea Giannone ?   
Could it be your daughter we ’re wanting to contact ?
”
“ I am Andrea , I go by Andre .   
Easier , not having to explain that I ’m not a woman .   
It ’s a man
’s name where I was born .
”
“
That ’s great .   
Andre , are n’t you the one charged with leasing the properties ?
”
“ Their records are out of date .   
I ’ve washed my hands of the business .   
Look elsewhere .
”
“
Can you give us the number of the person we can call ?
”
“
No .   
There are no vacancies in Cedar Point right now , and I wo n’t give you the number because I do n’t know who is handling things .
” ‘ Wo n’t give you the number’ , I noted .   
Not ‘ ca n’t give you the number ‘ .   
Despite not knowing ?
“
A cursory internet search suggests there are a lot of vacancies in Cedar Point .   
People are noting it and asking why .
”
“ I would n’t know .
”
“ You live there .
”
“ I keep to myself .   
Look elsewhere .   
Stop bothering an old man .
”
“ Mr. Giannone , I understand if you ’re scared .   
Do n’t answer me if you ’re worried people are listening in .   
We ’re heroes .
” Was the summary silence on the other end because he was worried people were listening in , or was it shock ?
“ We ’re heroes .   
We ’re a corporate team with plans of settling in .   
We know there are vacancies , and we know you still have signs up .   
If we can get this working , we ’re going to look after you and the people in Cedar Point .
”
“
What ?   
A corporate team ?
”
“ Of heroes , Mr. Giannone .   
We call ourselves Auzure .   
Au for the chemical symbol for gold , azure for blue , I do n’t know if that will help you remember .   
You ’ll see us around , if we can do this without stepping on anyone else
’s toes .
”
“
Toes ?   
What ?
”
I glanced over the others , and saw Tristan doing the same thing .   
His eyes met mine .   
I wondered if he had the same thought I did , about how Dido ’s clarification about the name would only confuse people .
“ Jurisdictions , Mr. Giannone .   
It would n’t be good if we turned up there and ended up in a turf war with fellow heroes over who gets to help .
”
“ Why would there be fighting to-
there ’s nothing here .   
There ’s nobody here .   
It ’s a nowhere place .   
Everyone who could leave left .   
Everyone else wants to be left alone .
” Was he aware of the contradiction in what he ’d said ?   
That there were no vacancies , but there was nobody there ?
Dido went on , taking on a tone that made me think she was in sales .   
“
It might be a nowhere place right now , Mr. Giannone , but I promise you , Auzure can change that .   
The other heroes want to change it .   
Whatever happens , you ’re going to get some stellar heroes in your neighborhood .   
Hopefully it ’s us , and we can clear the way so that everyone that left can come back .
”
Dido ’s earnest , almost painful optimism toward the end was contrasted by the sputtering reply .
“
You ’ll make this place a warzone .
”
“
We ’ll handle things in a good way .   
Trust us .   
Auzure is gentle but we get the job done .
”
There was inarticulate sputtering on the other side for a few seconds .   
“
I ’m not the person to bother with this .   
Do n’t call me again .
”
Mr. Andre Giannone hung up the phone .
“ Kenzie , ” Tristan said , putting a hand on the back of Kenzie ’s chair .
The camera shifted , focusing on a small house on the edge of the downtown strip .   
Tall windows and a realty sign , with the second floor having suggestions of an upstairs apartment .
“ I feel bad , ” Dido said , speaking to the dead air .
“
Can we talk back to her ?
” Sveta asked .
“
No , but- ” Kenzie hit a few keys .   
The call ended , and then the phone rang .
“
Here you are , ” Dido said .   
“
Beautiful .   
Was that what you needed ?
”
“
We ’re going to see , ” Tristan said .   
“
The man you called is going out for a walk .
”
Mr. Giannone was dressed in a suit jacket over what might have been a thin sweater or long - sleeved shirt , with nice hair combed straight back from his face , but where he might have looked dashing , gray hair or no , he had bad posture that made him look older than he probably was .   
He walked with what I could only call alacrity .
“ Patching in , ” Kenzie said .   
“
We ’ll send you the video after , but for now it ’s going to be audio only .
”
“
Lovely !   
I get to see and hear the rest ?
”
“
It ’s part of the deal , ” Tristan said .   
“
We ’ll pass on info about villains and the greater villain network as we pull things together .   
We ’re hoping you ’ll keep from stepping on our toes in the meantime , as you put it .   
Houndstooth was saying you were better than some of your teammates about jumping into something like this without regard for us .
”
“ Hmm .   
I could see it if we were itching for something to do , but I do n’t think it ’s likely .   
Right now , I do n’t think we could .   
Too much to do already .
”
“ The war ?
” I asked .
“
That ’s a big part of it .
”
“
How is it ?   
How bad ?
” Sveta asked .
“ I have no idea .   
It feels like none of the people doing the talking and negotiations want it to happen , especially as we ’re getting hints about how bitter a war it could be .   
Earth C does n’t mess around .
”
“
Do you think it ’s going to happen ?
” Sveta asked .   
She sounded more anxious now .
“
The diplomats and most of the people at the very top on both sides are fighting it , but it seems like things are moving inexorably in that direction .   
Yes .
”
Sveta ’s chin dropped a bit as she looked down at the ground .   
I reached out for her , and stopped as I heard a small ‘ thup’ sound , followed by another .
Her arms and legs had n’t moved , so I took it as her tendrils striking at the interior of her body in the same way a prisoner might punch the wall of their cell .
“
My hope is we ’ll keep moving at this steady , unwilling pace , there will be an initial exchange of blows , and both sides back off , ” Dido said .   
“
My worry is that something explosive will happen .   
Another broken trigger , an attack from Earth C doomsday radicals , an attack from the Fourth Sect , someone stupid from our world trying to take territory over there .   
I could go on .   
It might spark something lasting .
”
I approached Sveta in a way that let her see I was coming , moving slowly .   
I wanted to ask if it was okay to make contact , and I did n’t want to say it out loud , where the others or Dido might hear .
“
Fourth Sect ?
” Tristan asked .   
“
Have I heard of this before ?
”
Sveta saw me and reached out .   
I took her hand in mine , and reached out with the other arm to put it around her shoulders .
“
I ’d call it a cult
but I ’m not
sure it ’s the right term .   
They ’re a minority power with a strong political voice .   
They want war , to thin their own populations after too much ‘ be fruitful and multiply’ .   
Hard to get into in any detail on that cycle .   
Some of Gimel ’s biggest allies in Earth C are people who want to postpone war because it makes the Fourth Sect weaker .
”
“
Your thinking is if they get to the point where they ’re desperate , they ’ll try to spark something , ” Tristan said .
“
Not my thinking .   
People higher than me .   
They ’re some of what we ’re watching out for .
”
Tristan glanced at Sveta , then said , “
We ’re okay , right ?   
We do have the edge on powers .   
Makes for an incredible toolbox .
”
“ We have an edge , but it ’s not as big as you might think , ” Dido said .   
“ Our side has people who can detect or see powers , and what we keep hearing from them is that this guy has powers , but on the down - low .   
That woman has powers , nobody seems to be aware .   
A lot of them are using their abilities to maneuver into positions of power .
”
“ Can we stop talking about this ?
” Sveta asked .   
It felt strange hearing so abrupt a question when I had n’t felt it in her body or breathing .
“ We can , ” Tristan said .
“
Sorry , ” Sveta said .   
“
To cut in like that .
”
“ I do n’t mind , love , ” Dido said .   
“
We can talk about other things .   
I ’d welcome the distractions .
”
“ Mr. Giannone is at the center of town .   
He seems to know where to go to talk to the villains , ” Tristan reported .
“ Lovely , ” Dido said .   
“
Some silliness to take my mind off of things .
”
Silliness .   
We were treating this situation as serious , we were trying to save Cedar Point and the people within , and we were trying to break up a criminal organization before it extended its reach too far or imploded .   
With all of our various issues , with one team member ’s life on the line , we were making sacrifices and devoting ourselves to this in the long term .
Silliness ?
To someone that was trying to head off a war with another universe ?   
I could concede her that , but I could also think she could have worded it way more respectfully .
I decided to write her off as a bit of a ditz and let it be .
Giannone entered the bar , and my first thought was that we would n’t have the audio or video .
Moments later , however , he emerged with Prancer .
“ … not involved in this .
”
“ Andre , if you do n’t want to be involved , walking into the bar where we gather is n’t the way to do it .   
Not voicing your issues in earshot of ten people with powers .   
Let ’s talk in my office .
”
“ Being seen walking into your office is n’t any better , ” Andre Giannone said , resisting being led by the arm .   
Prancer stopped trying , and the older man said , “ Thank you .
”
“
We ’ll keep it polite , ”
Prancer said , “ Both in what we talk about , and in appearing civil .
”
The people in the bar could see out the window .
“
They called me .   
What am I supposed to say ?   
If this goes to court- ” “
Let ’s not talk about court .
”
“
What if ? ” Andre said .
“
It ’s not going to .   
The courts have too much to do to bother with someone like you .   
Even with people like us .
”
“
You said the heroes would n’t bother either , and how many have we seen or heard about now ?
”
“ Andre .   
Listen .   
If they decide they ’ll bother with petty crime , they ’ll come after me , the other villains .   
They wo n’t go after the scared citizens .   
If they thought someone had done something , they would think it was because the people were forced .
”
Prancer ’s tone changed at the end there .   
Too light to be anything but joking .   
I wondered how tone would play out with the court , if Giannone was charged .   
I let go of Sveta and walked over to the whiteboard to note the question .   
Something for a future discussion with Natalie or someone like her .
“
I do n’t want this hassle , ” Andre Giannone said .
“ I understand .   
We ’re already taking steps .   
We ’re getting information , we ’re getting help .   
We ’ll have more in a bit , and we ’ll fill you in .
”
“ What am I supposed to do when they call ?
”
“
Hang up .   
Say whatever you said .   
Tell them you have no space .   
Do whatever you have to , but do n’t rent to them .   
And do n’t show up at the bar .   
Call me .
”
“ I wanted to get you sooner than that .
”
“
Call .   
Now , who was it that called ?
”
“ Something about blue and gold .
”
“ Goldenrod ?
”
“
No .   
I do n’t know .   
Maybe .
”
I felt a kind of satisfaction at the confusion .   
Dido was a salesman , maybe , or a face - person , but she was n’t a marketing person .   
The way she ’d described Auzure had n’t been a good way to make it memorable .
“
Could it have been Auzure ?
” Prancer asked .
“
That ’s it , I think .
”
“ Okay , ” Prancer said .   
“
I know someone I can ask for more details on what they ’re doing .   
That ’s good .   
Useful .
”
“
Who do you know ?
”
Dido asked , as if Prancer could hear her .
Prancer continued talking , oblivious .   
“
Next time , remember .   
That ’s all you need to do .   
Leave it to me to decide if we need to worry .
”
He laid a hand on Andre Giannone ’s shoulder as he said it .   
It was a way to show support , and also a way to steer his conversation partner , suggesting the man walk back the way he came .
“ I ’ve held up my end so far , ” Andre said , resisting being guided as he said it .
“
And you get allowances others in the neighborhood do n’t .   
Nobody knocks on your door .   
You have tenants .
”
“
Nobody ’s knocking on my door , maybe , but I ’m getting calls .
”
“
A call .   
One , ” Prancer said .   
He walked , one hand on Andre Giannone
’s shoulder , getting Andre started on his way .   
“
And we ’re taking steps to rectify the unwelcome attention .   
Things should calm down soon .
”
“ Okay , ” Andre said .   
He looked at Prancer .   
“
I do n’t need to worry ?
”
“ You do n’t need to worry .
” Andre walked away .   
Prancer stood where he was , hooking thumbs in his jacket pockets , head tilted .   
The camera got a good angled view of his expression as he turned around .   
A confident smile .
A smile for the people in the window who might be looking at him , but he spoke under his breath , too quiet for even Kenzie ’s camera to pick up .
“
Can you get that for us ?
” Tristan asked .
“ Yep !
”
It took a short bit , and Prancer did n’t re - enter the bar , instead walking over to the building across the street , where his ‘ office’ apparently was .
“
What the hell is going on ?
”
Prancer ’s hiss came through the speakers .
“ We ’re going on , ” Chris said .
“
Thank you for the help , Dido , ” Tristan said .
“
I ’m glad to , hon .   
I was worried I ’d bothered an old man for nothing , but he ’s in this , is n’t he ?
”
“ We had cues he was .
”
“
Let us know if you need anything else .
”
“ Thanks , ” Tristan said .
The conversation wrapped up with some goodbyes , and the call ended .   
Windows closed , and parts of Kenzie ’s computer - cube went dark .
“ We ’ve got one group passing through later this afternoon .   
We could postpone it if needed .   
These guys are Houndstooth ’s recommends , ” Tristan said .   
“ Victoria ?   
You ’ll handle it ?
”
“ My cousin will come with .   
Just in case they ’re keeping an eye out for me and have surface - to - air planned .
”
“ Missiles ?
” Chris asked .
“
Anything , ” I said .
“
They ’re starting to adapt , ” Tristan said .   
“ Info and help ?
”
“ As far as info goes , ” I said , “ Natalie said someone tried hacking into the Wardens’ headquarters , specifically targeting my mom .
”
“ Was n’t me , ” Kenzie said .
“ I feel like if it was Tattletale , they would have been cleverer about it .   
Sveta , since you were seen too , though they probably ca n’t connect you to your past self , you might want to make sure all accounts are secure .
”
“
Okay , ” Sveta said .
“ Then that only leaves Rain , ” Tristan said .   
“ Decompress , take notes , do whatever .   
We leave to meet him in a few minutes .
”
He was taking on the leadership role .   
Ashley had seemed to want it , and she ’d included herself when Houndstooth had wanted to meet people in charge , but she was n’t fighting him on this .
I noted that , and I wondered .
I watched as the tight cluster of the group broke up .   
No longer gathered around the screen , standing behind Kenzie ’s desk , they moved toward their individual spaces .   
Chris had the largest bubble around him , where he did n’t have people within it .   
His gait was different than it had been .
Ashley went to her board .   
She ’d been quiet throughout , and now she stopped in front of her whiteboard .   
A mix of her writing and Kenzie ’s marked it , with her writing along the center , each line slanted as if it was written on an angle , like a tower of stacked coins that was about to buckle and fall .   
Kenzie ’s writing marked the bottom third , with a few drawings of eyes .
Whatever means of communication they had devised between them , I could n’t decipher it .   
I could n’t even begin to read Ashley ’s handwriting .   
Kenzie went to Ashley to resume their prior discussion .
“
You okay ?
” Tristan asked .   
I turned to look .   
He was talking to Sveta .   
“ You did n’t like that talk about war .
” Sveta shrugged .   
She smiled as I joined their conversation .   
“ Thank you for the hug .   
I did n’t even realize how upset I was until you came up to me .
”
“ Anytime , ” I said .
“
Was it the thought of Weld over there that got you ?
” Tristan asked .
Sveta shrugged , but it was n’t too effective with her suit .   
“
What threw me was when Dido talked about how people with powers were getting positions .
”
“
Why ?
” I asked .
“
Because it might not be only that .   
The people with positions might be getting powers .
”
“ Cauldron ?
” I asked .
Sveta nodded .   
“ Earth C is a major reason we had the supplies to rebuild .   
They say they did it out of goodwill .   
I think Cauldron made it happen .   
Gave powers to key people so they would agree , made deals .
”
She put out one arm , indicating the window and the city beyond it .
“ How much of that was bought and paid for with crimes against humanity ?   
I saw some of what they did .   
I heard a lot more about it .   
My entire life , this body of mine , it ’s because of them , ” Sveta said .   
“
It ’s awful to think about .
”
I looked out at the city that gleamed with traces of yellow and gold in the light of the early afternoon .
“ I do n’t know a lot about them , ” Tristan said .
“
I only know some , ” I said .   
“
The info came out after , but it trickles out , there ’s a lot of guessing to be done .
”
“ I do n’t have to guess , ” Sveta said .   
“
I can tell you more some day .   
But it ’s going to take a few minutes longer than it takes to talk to Rain .
”
Chris had joined Kenzie and Ashley ’s conversation .   
Kenzie was bouncing with excitement , trying to get Chris’ input .   
He seemed reluctant to dish , but quick to shoot down this idea or that idea .
“ You want to sit on this , skip out on the Rain conversation ?
” I asked .
“ I do n’t know , ” Sveta said .   
“
I think I have to go , because I ’m one of the only people who knows most of the story .   
It feels like I ’m the only one who knows most of everyone ’s story .   
I know yours , Victoria .   
I know
Rain ’s , I think .
I have my suspicions about what he ’s going to say .
”
“ I think I know , ” Tristan said .   
“
And I have a few big worries .
”
⊙ I flew around the area before settling down .   
Everyone was gathered .
Erin drove a different vehicle than the last time .   
It was a sedan , small and very dusty .   
The accumulated fine dirt on the side had settled into waves that looked like very flat , spread out sand dunes , set on a vertical surface , with peaks , valleys , and patterns .
Erin opened the door .   
The dark makeup around her eyes was heavier , her hair was unwashed , and she wore a slim - fit sweatshirt with the sleeves rolled up , a cat on the sleeve .   
Her low - rise jeans were tucked into calf - height boots .
“
Hi Erin , ” Kenzie said .
“
Hi , critter , ” Erin said .   
“ How are you doing ?
”
“ I was having a good day , but now this is happening .   
Feels ominous .
”
“
Yeah , ” Erin said .
Rain took more time to get out of the passenger seat .   
He moved like an old man , shutting the door , letting a backpack fall to the ground by one of the car ’s wheels .   
He had a black eye , his ear was swollen and scraped up , and his face looked asymmetrical in a way that suggested swelling on one side , with no distinct source .   
His knuckles and fingers were badly scraped up , with tape covering up some of them .
He was wearing a raglan tee with black sleeves , and jeans so old that they must have been as soft as sweatpants .   
The knees were worn through , and the knees beneath were speckled with scabs .
“
You ’re hurt , ” Kenzie said .
Rain nodded .
“
Did you get attacked ?
” Chris asked .
Rain shook his head .   
“ Not by Snag ’s group .
”
It was hard , to pull back and watch .   
I ’d tried for the call with Dido , stepped back to observe , letting Tristan take point with directing the others .   
He was good at it .   
Sveta being the one who had struggled had pulled me in a bit .
I was n’t sure strict objectivity was the way to handle this , but getting too close did n’t help either .
That line of thought got me thinking about how I had n’t ever really had to watch my back .   
Not among those I considered allies .   
Not among friends .   
Not among family .
And that , in turn , made me think about my sister , and the sick , hollow , angry experience of being betrayed by someone I ’d thought I could trust more than I trusted myself .
I stood across from Rain
and I felt like I had in the bank .   
The bank had been dusty , partially my fault , the floor scratched up by the passage of giant dogs , littered with discarded pieces of paper and dropped belongings .   
It had been dark , the rain pattering outside .
Much like Rain stood by the front of the car , hurting , his life in danger , my sister had stood a distance away from me , a knife to her throat .
Following that there had been the revelation of secrets .   
It was n’t that I held Rain close to my heart or anything .   
It was n’t even that I particularly trusted him .   
Only that I recognized the pattern .
“ Shit , ” Rain said .
“ If you ’re going to draw this out , at least tell me this is n’t you explaining everything and dropping something heavy on me , ” Tristan said .
“
No big news for you , ” Rain said .
Tristan nodded .
“
You ’re going to tell us what ’s been going on with you ?
” Sveta asked .
Rain looked at Erin .   
“
Yeah .
”
“
She ’s tied to this ?
” Sveta asked .
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .   
“
Kind of .   
She could walk away free and clear if she wanted , I think .   
She knows most of my situation .   
Not all .
”
“
I ’m moral support , ” Erin said .
“
No , ” Rain said .   
“
Because there ’s stuff you do n’t know .   
Kind of .   
It ’s complicated .
”
“ You ’ve got a look in your eyes , ” Ashley said .   
“ Fiercer .
”
“ I spent a good day and got a beating trying to find that fierceness , ” Rain said .   
“
That thing that would let me say this .   
Tristan called me out , said I needed to tell you guys , because it impacts what we ’re doing .   
I needed to do some figuring out before I was able .
”
“
Yeah , ” Tristan said .
I was silent .   
I could only see the parallels .   
I held my tongue because I did n’t trust it .   
If this was an echo of that situation in the bank , I had no better idea on how to handle it now in the present .
No rain , no enclosed area .   
We were at the edge of a park .   
It was sunny out .
No knife to anyone ’s throat , not that Rain ’s expression said any different .
“
You ’ve been hiding with powerful people , ” Ashley said .   
“ Capes , probably .
”
Rain opened his mouth , then nodded .
“
A gang .
”
“
A family , ” Rain said .   
“ Gang does n’t really say it .
”
“
It was always us and them .   
And there was a lot of hate directed at them , ” Rain said .
The in - group , out - group … and family .   
I could connect dots .   
I deliberately avoided doing so .
I focused on the situation instead , on the others .   
Chris was quiet , smiling slightly , but the smile had been a small , persistent thing since he ’d nose - dived into indulgence .   
Tristan was quiet , but most of what he had to add were things that it was
Rain ’s responsibility to share .   
Ashley handled the questions .
No- Sveta joined her voice to Ashley ’s .   
“
You ’re related to those powers .   
It ’s why you have such a hard time pulling away .
”
“
The Fallen , ” Rain said .
I winced .   
There were a lot of implications to that .
“
Oh , ” Kenzie said .
“
I kind of connected the dots already , ” Sveta said .   
She put a hand on Kenzie ’s shoulder .   
“
You first connected to Tristan after the God thing .
”
“ Religion came up in therapy , ” Rain said , for the benefit of the rest of us .   
“ Tristan came up to me after and asked about which church my family attended .   
I ’d had a bad week .   
Nearly as bad as this week has been .   
We ’d already connected some .   
Both of us have people invading our heads , questions of self , we talked a lot together in therapy .   
I cracked .   
I told him .
”
“
Yeah , ” Tristan said .   
“
Mom and dad were looking for a church .   
I thought I ’d ask Rain .   
I do n’t think Rain ’s church would ’ve suited them .
”
“
It ’s not funny , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Do n’t make jokes .
”
“
I ’m not laughing , Kenzie , ” Tristan said .
“
They hate black people , do n’t they ?
”
Kenzie asked Rain .
“
They ’re a big group , ” Rain said .   
“
It ’s hard to get into just how varied the branches are ,
the different beliefs , how they add up , some of the leaders that have come and gone .   
It ’s hard to just point at them and say they hate this or they hate that .
”
“ Most of them hate black people , ” Kenzie said .
“ …
Yeah .
”
“
Did your family ?   
Did you ?   
Do you ?
”
Rain looked back at Erin .   
“
Yeah .   
I did .   
Once .   
You have to understand- it
’s hatred for anyone and everyone , because that way it keeps everyone close to the family .   
So ‘ black’ was just one more label , you know ?
”
“ Back at the first meeting with Mrs. Yamada .   
You kept giving me looks , ” Kenzie said .   
“
They were n’t because I pay attention to the clothes I wear and dress nice , or because you were trying to figure out what was wrong with me .
”
“
It was n’t about you , ” Rain said .   
“
I was figuring stuff out then .   
I was trying to reassess my whole way of thinking .   
It was me , not you .
”
“
It was you , ” Kenzie said .   
She paused .   
“ Being uncomfortable with me being there .
”
“
It was- ” Rain started .   
“
Me being uncomfortable with everything .
”
“
Including me .   
Especially me , right then , ” Kenzie said .   
She paused , waited for a response .   
When Rain did n’t deny her , she added , “ That … sucks .
”
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .
“
I ’m not saying you suck .   
It sucks to hear it .
”
“ If it helps , ” Rain said .   
“
I ’ve changed a lot since then .   
I ’m still figuring some stuff out .
”
“
A lot of different groups to un - hate , ” Chris said .
“ I- kind of , ” Rain said .   
“
I still catch myself a lot .   
I think of things , I realize I ’m making these assumptions .   
Then I want to change
and I do n’t know
how .   
I try to use you guys as role models or talk to Mrs. Yamada , or I read , look up and watch a movie .   
But it ’s a lot to re - teach myself .
”
“ Blacks , Hispanics , Asians , Natives , Middle Easterners , then gay , trans , ” Tristan rattled off .
“
Deeper than that , ” Rain said .   
“ I had to start with re - figuring women and how I thought about them .   
I ’m still pretty shitty , as much as I ’m trying , because I hear you rattle that off
and my first thought is ‘ some of these are n’t like the others’
and I have to stop myself .
”
“
You ’ve said a few things , ” Chris said .
“
Probably .
”
“ I figured you were a redneck .
”
“
Worse , ” Rain said .
“ They get in your head , ” Erin jumped in .   
“
They got my parents .   
My little brother .    
They got Rain when he was little .   
I accept he ’s trying .
”
“
There was a Fallen group that found a pair of people like me , ” Sveta said .
Rain closed his eyes , looked down .
“
Boy and a girl .   
Case fifty - threes .   
Arizona .   
Peat and Fen .   
They showed up in a few cities , did some stunts , hero - ish .   
Junior level stuff .   
But they were juniors , we think .
”
“ I know the story , ” Rain said .
“ They were terrified of vehicles and they hated the idea of the PRT .   
They had a lot of peculiarities .   
They could n’t stay in one place for long .   
Communities pulled together .   
It was a really cool thing , they ’d get motel rooms paid for by fans , they had tutors come to visit .   
There was talk of trying to get them into the school system .   
It was tricky because they were tricky .
”
Rain nodded .
“
It was a really cool thing , ” Sveta said .   
“
There were blogs that followed them , and they were really positive .   
There was art drawn of them-
I really liked that .   
A couple of times a week there would be articles talking about how they were doing something new and better
and it was a step forward .
”
“ I knew some of it , ” Rain said .
“
You should know all of it .   
There was a time in my life when I could only vicariously enjoy those sorts of things , and I ’d wake up
and I ’d tell myself I would check the blog after lunch
and I would check the art page after dinner , and that was the sort of thing that helped me get through the days .   
Weld stuff was first thing .   
There were others .   
But Peat and Fen were big .
”
“ I know , ” Rain said .
“ They went down the wrong stretch of road and some Fallen jackasses on motorcycles thought they ’d get a good reaction from people by holding the pair down and taking a chainsaw to their horns .   
To decorate their fucking helmets !
”
Rain nodded , averting his eyes .
“ Knife marks suggested someone tried to cut off one of their faces to wear it as a mask .   
You can imagine how I felt , ” Sveta said .   
She moved her hair , showing the edge of her face , the mass of pencil - thin black tendrils behind it .   
“
Since I ’m only a mask and an assortment of lethal weapons .   
You can imagine how I felt , when instead of my daily pick - me up
I got the news that they ’d died from loss of their horns .
”
Kenzie ducked her head , and started to walk away .   
When I went to follow and check her head , Ashley held up a hand and bid me to stop , following Kenzie instead .
“
This is n’t an inquisition , ” Erin said .   
“ Rain is n’t responsible for everything the Fallen have done .
”
Sveta ignored Erin for the moment .   
“
Other Fallen groups have taken us for freak shows .   
The embodiments of the end times .   
Tom and Jake Crowley .   
I know that ’s not on you , Rain , but you have to realize they are n’t good people .
”
“
I ’m more than aware .
”
“
Then at least tell me you ’re not going to go back , ” Sveta said .
“ I have to , ” Rain said .
I could see Sveta ’s face fall .
“ I have to , ” Rain said .   
“
I have no choice .   
Really .
”
“
Okay , ” Sveta said , her voice sad .   
“
I think you have more choice than you think you do .
”
“ I really do n’t .   
If I could do anything else , I would .   
I ’m aware of a lot of things that are worse than Peat and Fen , ” Rain said .
“
What happened to Peat and Fen is pretty fucking bad , ” Sveta said .   
She turned to Erin .   
“
You ’re not responsible for what others did , but if you ’re leaning on them for protection or strength , then that ’s not okay .   
You ca n’t use that strength .
”
“
They have my family , ” Erin said .
“
And they do n’t let you go , ” Rain said .   
“
It ’s all … very complicated .
”
Ashley returned to the group .   
Kenzie was still sitting in the grass , a distance away , her back to us .
When I looked , Ashley gestured .   
Telling me to stay .
Rain looked pretty battered .   
Dejected .
He met my eyes .
“
There ’s more to it , ” Ashley said .
“
Oh yeah ,
” Rain said .
“ If you wo n’t say it , then I will , ” Ashley said .   
“ I ’ll guess .   
You killed people .
”
Rain went very still .
I could remember a similar look on my sister
’s face .
He huffed out a breath , hands at his lap as he slouched back against the front of the sedan , sitting against the hood .   
He did n’t seem to know what to do with his hands .
“
Yeah , ” he finally said .
“ Innocents , ” she said .
“ Kids , ” Rain said .   
He looked in Kenzie ’s direction .   
At Chris .   
Then he looked over his shoulder at Erin .
“
Why ?
” Chris asked .
“ I ’ve been asking myself
that a lot .
”
“ You maimed people , ” Ashley said .   
Still on the offense .
“ Long term injuries .   
Burns , ” Rain said .   
“ To people of all ages .
”
“ For fun ?
” Ashley asked .
“
For respect , if anything .   
I do n’t know , ” Rain said .   
He looked back to Chris , since he was really answering his question .   
“ Because a large part of me had only ever known the family , the lifestyle .   
All of the language – outsiders were … less .   
It was okay to hurt ten of them if you helped one of the family ’s .
”
“ They had your whole childhood to work on you , ” Erin said .
“ Does n’t excuse it , ” Rain said .
“
No .   
But it explains it , ” she said .
“
Your whole life ?
” I asked .   
My first time speaking in this conversation , maybe .   
I was n’t sure
–
I was in a different mode .
“ My parents were early adopters , mostly on the fringe .   
They got more into it as it grew .   
Renamed me early enough
I do n’t remember my original name .   
Rain O’Fire Frazier .
”
“
That ’s terrible , ” Chris said .
“ Shush , ” Sveta said .
“ Everything about the Fallen is terrible , ” Rain said .   
“ A few years after the name change , they sold me to a family halfway across the country , used the money to fuck off traveling like they ’d always talked about .   
My guardians right now are people I ’ve called my aunt and uncle my whole life .   
I got powers with the cluster trigger , at a time
I was just one more set of hands and a weapon , a henchman .   
That was supposed to elevate me and … it did the opposite .   
That was my wake - up call .
”
“
It ’s good
you had one , ” Tristan said .
“ I do n’t like the idea of you going back , ” Sveta said .   
“ When you pull away is when things get worse , when violence happens .
”
“
It ’s why I ’m not pulling away , ” Rain said .
“
You ’re with us , ” Tristan said .   
“
You ’re doing your own thing .
”
From the bank robbery to the period after .   
Trying to find normal again .
Rain had been more open .   
Did that change the course of this particular river , compared to the one I ’d known ?   
Or were the key elements all there , still ?   
The discomfort , the ‘ I ’m trying but I ’m not going to do anything different’ ?
Did it still lead to disaster in the end ?
“
Is the critter
okay ?
”
Erin asked .   
“ Kenz ?
”
“
She ’ll be fine if this ends and the group is still together , ” Ashley said .
“
Are we ?
”
Rain asked .
“
I ’m not going to say no , ” Sveta said .   
“
But I think you need to go .   
Yesterday .   
Get out of there .   
Trust the Wardens .
”
“ I would if I thought they would protect me , ” Rain said .   
“
But they ’re busy .   
The news articles say they ’re not even here lot of the time .
”
“
I ’m
okay ,
” Tristan said .   
“
This is ninety - five percent known stuff , and elaboration on other stuff .
”
The voices of the others were a jumble .   
Chris did n’t care about anything .   
Ashley , as odd as it was , seemed most uncomfortable .
“ Victoria ,
” Rain said .   
“ You ’ve been quiet .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .
I was aware of the silence that followed my statement .
“ Snag ’s army .   
They ’re after the Fallen , ” I said .
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .
“
But they want you .
”
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .   
His expression darkened as he said it .   
No illusions about what was in store for him if that happened .
“
Because of the kids , and the others you killed .   
Because they blame you .
”
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .
I nodded .
“ I can tell you the details , if-
”
“
I ’m going to go ,
” I said , interrupting .   
I was aware of the looks I got .   
“
Tell Kenzie everything ’s cool .   
I ’ll be back .   
I just need to think on this .
”
No actions out of instinct .   
I ’d think , piece everything together .
I flew away from the scene before I could say or do something I ’d regret .
⊙
Another group was patrolling the area that afternoon .   
Crystal and I stood on a square of crimson forcefield , well above Cedar Point , watching .
They were an older group , a bit of armor , some swords , a spear .   
One of them was a Brute who carried a crossbow bigger than I was .   
I ’d always liked those things .
Simple .   
Easy .   
Bad guys bad and a bit lame .   
Good guys a bit lame and doing good work .
“
I ’m going back to the PRTCJ , ” Crystal said .   
“
Next week .
” I did n’t want her to go back .   
There was very little to like about the group .
Ironically , the advice I was following in regards to that had to do with cults .   
Not putting up too much of an offense , not scaring them into throwing up walls .
“
It ’s been two weeks , ” I said .   
“
How do they handle that ?
”
“
No idea .   
Pay deduction , extra drills , demotion .
”
“ I told you what I heard from D.   
There ’s war on the horizon .
”
D.    Dido .   
In case we were being listened to .   
Prancer
’s clairvoyants could have been listening in , and he could have hired additional intelligence gathering .   
No telling .   
We dodged particulars .
“
That ’s part of why I ’m going , ” Crystal said .
“
Spooks me , ” I said .
“ You doing this spooks me , ” Crystal said .   
“ I want to meet everyone at some point .
” I nodded .   
“
Okay .
”
“ You think you have a handle on this ?
”
“ I think so , ” I said .   
If ‘ this’ meant Cedar Point .   
“
On other stuff ?   
Less sure .
”
“
What can I do ?   
We want you more sure .
”
“
Looks like our guests are free and clear .   
We ’ll see what they say later .   
I ’ve got a meeting .   
Do you mind flying with me ?
”
“ I ’m glad to .   
But we got ta eat .
”
I was n’t hungry , I was rarely hungry after thinking too much about the past , and I ’d been thinking about it a lot during the discussion with Rain .   
Still , I nodded .
I picked up the bag and the books I ’d placed atop the field , putting everything away .   
Crystal dropped the forcefield , and we flew with me leading the way .
It was already getting dark .   
The flight was n’t a short one .   
I put on my music , because conversation was hard with the wind in my ears .
Time to think about Crystal and the PRTCJ .   
The war with Earth C.    Rain .   
Kenzie .   
About what the hell I was doing here .
The sun had set by the time we arrived .   
The waterfront had a railing with oversized posts a boat could be lashed to .   
I leaned against the railing , checked my phone , and sent a message .
Mrs. Yamada approached from our right .   
She had food from a nearby food truck .
“ Crystal , ” she said .   
“
It ’s so nice to see you .
”
“
You too ,
” Crystal said .   
She gushed just a bit as she said it .   
She ’d met Mrs. Yamada at the hospital .   
They ’d had talks about things .   
About Crystal losing Uncle Neil and Eric .   
About me .
There was a brief catching - up .   
Pleasantries .   
I chimed in once or twice , then found I did n’t have it in me .   
I stared out over the water .
“
I think- do you mind giving us privacy ?
” Mrs. Yamada asked .
“
Sure .   
How ’s the food here ?
”
“
This ?   
It ’s good .
”
“
Wave when you want me to come back .   
I ’ll be enjoying the view until then .
”
Mrs. Yamada leaned against the railing next to me .   
Her dinner smelled amazing and I still did n’t want to eat anything .
“
Sorry to be eating while we talk .   
I have n’t had a bite to eat since grabbing a protein bar and a pear at five forty - five this morning .
”
“
It ’s okay , ” I said .   
“
Please eat .   
Thank you for seeing me .
”
“ Thank you .   
Is everyone okay ?
”
“
Intact , yes .   
Okay ?   
Were they okay when I met them ?
”
“ They were in a place where I felt like they could finish their own journeys .   
Most of them .   
I imagine there ’s some backsliding here and there , difficulties and things that are n’t okay because of external stresses and internal factors within the group .
”
“
Some , ” I said .   
“
Some figuring things out from moment to moment .   
Small triumphs .
”
“
That ’s good .   
More or less what I expected .
”
“ Rain revealed his situation , ” I said .
“
I heard , ” Mrs. Yamada said .   
“
You wanted to do some thinking .
”
“ I did , ” I said .
“ I ca n’t do that thinking for you .   
But if you want to talk out loud , I can help you along the way .
”
“ When it comes to Rain , I think I get it , ” I said .   
“
I ’m not
okay with it , but not in a way that ’s going to ruin anything .   
It sucks to see the big and little things that affect the others .   
Some issues close to Sveta ’s heart .
”
“ You ’re thinking about something else , ” she concluded .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“ When Weld showed up at the first session , he said he was sorry he could n’t sit in .
”
“ He did .
”
“
You asked him to counsel the group on their hero idea before you asked me .
”
“
Before the community center , before your boss called me .   
Yes .
”
“
He said no , but he could help in a while .
”
“
More or less .
”
“
But you chose me in the end .   
You could have waited and had him sit in , and he ’s … a great guy who everyone respects .   
You chose me , for reasons besides timing .
”
“
I ’m not much of a schemer .
”
“
That ’s not saying I ’m wrong , ” I said .
“
No it is n’t .   
But I ’m worried if I say yes
, then there ’s expectations , and there ’s disappointment if this does n’t end up going well .   
I ’m far from superhuman , I make mistakes , and this could be another .   
What are you thinking this is ?
”
“
You wanted a quality I had , that Weld might not .   
I was thinking about the team , the traps we could fall into .   
Is it the paranoia ?   
The fact I ca n’t quite trust people ?
”
“
That seems like an unkind way to describe yourself .
”
“
It ’s true .
”
“ Unkind , still .
”
“
You wanted someone that is n’t too enmeshed into the group .   
Someone wary that ’s seen the Asylum and knows the sort of thing that comes out of there .   
Someone that might see how they operate within the dynamic now that most have let their guards down .   
You think something ’s up , and you did n’t tell me what it is because you did n’t want me going in with too many preconceived ideas .   
Because … you wanted to see if I drew the same conclusions .   
Something bad ’s in play with this group .
”
She nodded to herself .
“
Am I wrong ?
” I asked .








Experience told me that after waking up from a bad dream , it was better for me to move .   
The emotional and mental impact of being tired for the rest of the day was far lower than if I remained in bed and stewed .   
Either way , I rarely fell back into sleep .
It was one of the few things that had been easier at the hospital .   
Sleep had been regular , reliable .   
There had n’t been any stretches where I ’d have nightmares or insomnia for three nights in a row and
the littlest things would be a grind by the third day .   
The drugs had been part of my diet , to ensure I fell asleep and woke up at certain times .   
They did n’t do much about the nightmares , but even waking up had n’t ended the nightmare back then .
I was perpetually tempted to get something to help , but the degree to which I was tempted was a warning bell in the back of my mind .
Sleep , eating , having a space to retreat to , physical affection , attention , socializing , breathing .   
It was always the basic , animal things that came apart in the wake of stress and crisis .   
Things broke down , got twisted , or they were reminders .
I woke up and I pulled on a pair of jeans .   
Red - dyed raw denim , washed with something dark that made the creases and seams very apparent .   
They were a little looser fitting than my going - out jeans , and I ’d settled into wearing them when I was at home and my dad was around , or now , when Crystal was around .   
It felt less like I was a slob if I was wearing them at home , especially if anyone dropped in .
Dean had tried on red jeans once , while I was shopping with him .   
His uncharacteristically self - conscious reaction had had me in stitches .   
If I had n’t been able to fly , I would have been on the floor laughing .   
It was a good memory and a large part of why the jeans were a security - blanket level thing for me .
The memory had a nice second part , when Dean had mentioned that even the brief wearing of the jeans had turned his legs and underwear red .   
His best friends and I had been there as he ’d recounted how concerned he ’d been before realizing , and how the redness on his underwear had been worse where it pressed against the jeans , especially at the front .   
He ’d described it as a clown - nose smudge on the front and his friends had been nearly falling out of their seats .
Even now , it put a smile on my face .
There were other memories too .   
Some from the same trip , others from other dates .   
He ’d tried on a lot of jeans and to this day I could remember a pair where he had looked perfect : in profile , in the narrow waist and hips , the broad shoulders , the pert butt .   
He ’d lifted up his shirt so I could see the fit , and I ’d seen the thin trail of body hair leading up to his navel , his flat stomach , and the bones of his hips just above the jeans .   
Already warmed up by my laughing fit earlier , I ’d worked myself up into a tizzy , the best words for it , and I ’d maintained the tizzyness until twenty minutes later when we were cutting through the parking lot to the bus stop .   
I ’d pulled him aside for a make out session .
I missed him so much it hurt , but the memories were happy ones and they were a good buffer against the bad night ’s sleep .   
I kept my t - shirt and underwear on from yesterday and I went without a bra , pulling on a white sweater with too - long sleeves and a wide collar that left my shoulders bare .
The fit was snuggly and enveloping , as if the sweater itself was giving me a hug ; kind of what I was shooting for when a not - insignificant part of me felt like I was five years old again , scared and wanting to crawl into bed with my mom and dad .
Set on putting the nightmare and the associated feelings behind me , I got some socks , underwear , sports bra , and a camisole top , stowing them in my bag where I already had my wallet .   
I pulled on some sneakers , sans socks , and headed to the balcony door .   
I eyed the clock in the kitchen as I passed it .   
Fifteen minutes to five .
I flew toward Cedar Point .
⊙ “ You ’re not wrong , ” Jessica Yamada said .
I stared out over the water .   
There was something sinister at play with the team .
Crystal was out at the water
’s edge now , leaning over the railing .   
Forcefields made a kind of table or tray for her to set her food down on .   
It drew the attention of bystanders , in a ‘ look at that , how cool’ way .
“
Double agent ?   
Someone under the influence of another ?
” I asked .
“
Telling you would be telling you who , ” Jessica said .   
“
Which , unfortunately , would be betraying confidence .
”
“
Can I think aloud ?
”
“ You can .
”
“ I got on this track of thought because I have an ominous feeling .   
I liken it to , uh , to my sister .
”
“
Keep in mind that hindsight might distort the picture with your sister .   
It ’s easy to look back and think things were better or worse than they were .
”
“ I-
yes , ” I said , conceding the point .   
“
Yes , but I can take key moments in isolation , scenes I remember with vivid detail , conversations down to the word , and I can use those as waypoints .   
I can recall what led up to what and what happened after , because I ’ve replayed it all in my head a thousand times , and I can compare that to this .
”
“
Do n’t lose sight of how replaying events in your head to such excruciating detail might distort the picture , as will gathering all of those like memories together .
”
“ I ’ll try not to , ” I said .   
“
Thinking aloud … you think something ’s up .   
You ’re equipped with all of the facts , you know
people ’s stories , most of the secrets .   
Sveta said something about how she ’s kind of unique in how she knows the most about most people , if I ’m included in things .
”
“ I imagine she does .
”
“ I had no background going in , but I called you to talk because I had worries , and I ’m realizing the general shape of your worries and why you brought me in .   
We ’re at the same conclusion , but we got here by different roads .   
Something ’s wrong or it ’s going to go wrong .
” Jessica ate while I talked .
“ You would be allowed to break confidentiality if there was a real and imminent risk of danger , or if there was a danger to a vulnerable group .   
And in the event of child abuse ?
”
“ I would if I knew there was a danger to any involved , ” Jessica said .   
“ I would also have to disclose if required by law
– a muddy thing these days , with the world hanging in suspension while the laws are being written .
”
“
I ’ve run into that a bit , ” I said , thinking of Natalie .
“
And if I had to disclose to obtain payment or ensure proper care , as I would if I was giving care to someone who then had to go to the Asylum .   
In either of those two cases , for law or working with other mental health professionals , I would get the patient ’s permission first .
”
“
So it ’s not that , obviously .   
But you ’re really worried .   
It ’s something that you think is likely enough that you want me there to keep an eye on things .
”
“ I gave some serious consideration to whether the risk , though not a certain one , was worth the cost to the patient , to my career , and to the other patients I might no longer be able to look after .
” I looked at Jessica .   
She took another bite of her barbecue chicken sandwich , adjusting the wrapper to catch the drips of sauce and bits of lettuce and onion .
“
What do you mean ?
” I asked .
With index finger and thumb still holding the sandwich , she held up some fingers to block her mouth while she chewed .   
I nodded , and waited for her to finish the mouthful .
She swallowed , paused , and then said , “
I mean that if I were to report , there is a chance my reasons for reporting might be seen as insufficient , unproven , or unclear .
”
“ Just a suspicion .   
A strong one .   
Not enough reason to bring authorities into it or take action against the person or people you ’re worried about .
”
“
Yes , ” she said .
“ What would happen ?
”
“
It ’s hard to say .   
The future of the law is unclear .   
But I can say I would be tied up in proceedings as they judge whether I had merit , which could take months or even more
than a year .   
Even if nothing happened , the fact that it even had to happen in the first place might impact who I could work for .   
I might have to take a leave from work , and I might not be able to work with the Wardens or with critical - risk , powered juveniles .
”
“
You ’re kidding , ” I said .
“ The PRT was stringent about who they would hire and take into confidence , and there ’s no reason to believe the next group to take power will be any less careful .   
Even with that in mind …
”
She trailed off .
“
You thought about telling people .   
That does n’t seem … just .   
There are a lot of people that rely on you .   
Even with the group therapy kids , it ’s pretty clear .   
I feel like if they did n’t have you , some pretty bad stuff would happen .   
And they ’re ,
what , ten percent of your caseload ?   
Less ?
”
“
Less .   
But I ca n’t ignore one wrong involving my patients for the sake of ensuring I can maintain care for the rest .   
Thankfully , it is n’t that binary in reality .   
I can act clearly and decisively when there ’s a clear and decisive danger .   
I can ask multiple someones that I know and respect to keep an eye out .
”
“
Me being one ?
”
“
Yes , Victoria .   
You ’re one of several .   
Some are waiting until the group is more visible , people in the Wardens will reach out and coordinate , they know where your group originated and that I ’m concerned about where it may go .
”
“
I may not be the best choice-
I know you did n’t choose me , exactly .   
You wanted me to try and steer the group away from the hero thing .   
I volunteered myself for this
and you were … ”
“
Relieved to have one set of eyes on things , on a more ongoing basis .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“ If you need to back away from this , you can , ” she said .   
“
Tell me and I ’ll help .   
Others will help to keep an eye on things , if at more of a distance .   
I involved you initially and I was glad when you seemed to be interested and invested in a way that played to your strengths and that you enjoyed .   
I was , again , relieved to have more eyes on things .   
I do not , however , want you to suffer for it .
”
I looked out over the water , which was so very dark and expansive .   
The city did n’t keep many lights on at night , with the power situation being what it was .   
Less lights to reflect down on the water after dark , less light reaching the clouds up above , to make the sky lighter .
Ink black darkness .
“ How have you been ?
” she asked .
I shrugged .
“
Back at the Asylum , after you had worked on your motor control , I had you keep a journal , with the attendant ’s help .
”
Dark , heavy feelings , to match what I saw over the water .
“
Each day in the calendar started with a drawn out cross , with a    number written in each of the four quadrants .   
We tracked how you were doing in various areas .
”
“ I did n’t make much progress .
”
“
You moved on to the independent care facility .
”
More dark , heavy feelings .
“
How would you fill it out now ?   
Physically , emotionally , contextually , and in the immediate picture with your personal needs .
”
“ I have no earthly idea , ” I said .
“ It might be worth paying attention to , ” she said .   
“
Have you called the number I gave you ?   
The therapist ?
” I shook my head .
“ If you sat down with a friend or a loved one and they told you they felt as you have these past few days
, their worries , wants , needs , and problems , would you want them to talk to someone qualified ?
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
I guess I would .
”
She took a bite of her sandwich , diplomatically avoiding saying something .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
I hear you .
” ⊙ I stopped in at the group ’s headquarters , landing on the fire escape , and unlocking the door with my key .
Lights started to turn on , computer monitors appearing ,
Kenzie ’s
cube glowing at the corners , as her projected image appeared in the computer chair , fritzing .
“
It ’s fine .   
Go back to sleep , Kenzie , ” I said , to the room .   
“
I woke up early and decided to go flying .   
I ’m using the shower .
”
There was a pause , and then the various projections , images , screens , and lights went dark , in the reverse order they had turned on .
I wondered if I ’d actually woken her up , and if she ’d actually heard me .
The apartment was fairly spacious , to the point it could have been a two - bedroom place if it actually had walls .   
As it was , the only walls encircled the corner , where a single shallow closet and the bathroom were .   
The bathroom , I could n’t help but note , was ridiculously small for the size of the overall apartment .   
Toilet , sink , and shower stall , with barely any room to squeeze in between one thing and the thing or things beside it .
I stepped into the bathroom and disrobed , leaning out past the door to hang up my jeans outside , so the humidity of the shower would n’t get at them .   
I hung up the rest of my clothes on the inside of the door .
It was paranoia over preserving the raw denim and bringing out any dye that regular wearing had n’t already worn away , maybe , but I ’d spent a week ’s pay on the jeans .   
If they had been free , I still would have been attached to them , because they reminded me of Dean , and because they were getting to be the most comfortable jeans I ’d ever had , after rigorous wearing .   
I was going to be fussy .
I had n’t gotten to be fussy with other things .   
A year after I had gone to the hospital , my mom had donated just about all of my clothes to charity .
There had been things I ’d bought with Dean , with friends , with Aunt Sarah or Crystal .   
Uncle Neil had always spoiled me rotten , going to Crystal for tips on what to get me , and there had been four or five things I would have liked to have .   
Some had been milestone things , dresses I ’d worn to school events , clothes I ’d gotten to take home from photo shoots , and small accessories I ’d bought as rewards to myself , like saving my first thousand and two thousand dollars , when I ’d thought I might move to another city to follow Dean , if the PRT moved him .
It had n’t been like she ’d needed the room .   
Dad had moved out by then
, I was gone , my sister was gone .   
It had been … her ripping off her own band - aid , by giving away my treasures .
I could have turned the shower to a scalding heat to try to find a physical way to reflect what I was feeling otherwise .   
I could have turned it to freezing cold , to wake myself up .
I opted for the embrace of warm water in lieu of the warm hug of the sweater I ’d taken off .   
I got into the shower and used my flight , bringing my knees to my chest and hugging my legs tight , closing my eyes .
I rotated in the air a few times over the course of what might have been twenty minutes , letting the water pour over me .   
I did n’t open my eyes once for the duration , and I did n’t feel like I might fall asleep .
⊙ I finished my recounting of my observations of the team .   
Jessica finished eating .
Rain was in a bad spot , and he ’d revealed himself to be Fallen .   
Kenzie and Houndstooth .   
Ashley and her outbursts .   
Chris and his lopsided dips into one emotion .   
Sveta ’s worries .   
Tristan and Moonsong .
“
No team name , a lot of missing cape names .   
I know you do n’t like the cape name thing-
”
“
It ’s not that I do n’t like it , ” Mrs. Yamada said .   
“
I think it can make sense to take a hero name as an adult , but for someone younger , it can be one part of a greater issue .   
It ’s hard enough for a teenager to decide who they are without the icon , the mask , and the name taking so much focus .
”
I wanted to argue the point so badly , and I was too tired to do it .   
A passionate debate about powers , identities and costumes with Jessica , outside of the bounds of a therapy session ?   
It would have been great .
“
There ’s going to be a war , ” I said .   
“ Rain is going to be swept up in it , if he has n’t already .   
They ’re hoping to kill him in the chaos .   
The others might be swept up in it .
”
“ We ’ll try to keep that from happening .
”
“ If it happens , we can try to make sure it happens in the safest , most controlled way possible , ” I said .   
I saw the look on her face , and hurried to add , “
I know you want to keep it from happening , but they want to protect each other , and they do want to stretch their wings and flex their powers .   
It ’s part of being a cape .
”
“ It is , ” Jessica said .   
“
What about you ?
”
“
Me ?
”
“
Will you be swept up in it ?   
Do you want to stretch your wings and flex your powers ?
”
“ I do n’t want to flex my powers , ” I said .   
“ I do want to be involved .   
I … see this as a snowball rolling downhill .   
It ’s chaotic and it has the potential to do a lot of damage , some of it inevitable .   
But for all their flaws , I think they are holding onto what you wanted to impart on them , for the most part they need … nudges .
”
“
Nudges ?
”
“
To change the course of the snowball .   
Reassuring Sveta .   
Redirecting Ashley or giving her an excuse to do what she wants to do anyway .   
Keeping Kenzie from overcommitting herself .   
Tristan gets into things and needs a bit of a shake , and he ’ll step back from the headlong charge .   
Rain-
more complicated , because it ’s not him , exactly .   
Self doubt , but it ’s external factors pushing in on him that we need to worry about .
”
“
And Chris ?
”
“ I do n’t even know .   
I plan to keep a close eye on him , because I have n’t figured him out and he does n’t seem like he wants to share any of himself , which makes me worry .   
I ’ll see if I can figure out what to do .
”
“
Nudges and keeping an eye on things , ” Mrs. Yamada said .   
“
I think you ’re on the right track .   
Step back if this is wearing on you .
”
I shook my head .   
“
Everything wears on me .   
Eating and sleeping wear on me .   
Stepping back would n’t do me any good .   
I ’ll call your colleague .   
Do what I can .
”
“ Self care , ” Jessica said .   
“
Yes .   
Be kind to yourself , reach out for help if you need it .   
You have friends .   
Do n’t lose sight of that .
”
I looked over in Crystal ’s direction .   
She waved the foil - wrapped sandwich in the air , as if baiting me .   
I found myself tempted , when I had n’t even been hungry before .   
“
Yeah .   
I just realized how ravenous I am .   
I feel like there are a hundred more things I should tell you that you need to know , but … ” “
Not enough minutes in the day , even if and when I get more with a helpful someone ’s power .   
I know .   
Go eat .
”
I stepped back from the railing .   
“
Sorry , I skipped breakfast and I tossed my lunch .
”
“ I ’d have stern words for you , but I barely ate today either .   
Take care of yourself , Victoria .
”
She hugged me .
“
We ’ll talk again soon , ” she said , without breaking the hug .
I nodded .
I had n’t worked out what I was doing in regard to Rain .   
A part of me had hoped for guidance .   
In the end , it had been better to give Mrs. Yamada the lay of the land .   
If she was suspicious , then my mention of outbursts , of backsliding , of stubbornness , confrontations or secrecy might have been the cue she needed to make a decision .
If she was okay with where things stood , then so was
I.    I would nudge
, I would keep an eye out , and I would look after myself .   
I felt more peace than I had , having had the conversation .
“ Bye , ” I said , my voice not all there because I was a little choked up .   
I could n’t wholly pin down why .
I broke the hug and went straight to my steaming barbecue chicken sandwich .   
Crystal too .
⊙ Shower off .   
Tangled mane transformed to wet combed locks , wet locks transformed to damp braid .   
Clothes on : sports bra on under sweater , sleeves rolled up around the wrists , red raw jeans , socks and sneakers .   
The clothes I ’d hung up on the bathroom door had been effectively steamed while I was in the shower , and my hands smoothed out the wrinkles that had accumulated from my clothes being in my bag .
Self care , to have a shower with no disturbances or worries about bothering Crystal .   
To dress in things that felt right .
The computers illuminated as I walked through the main room .
“ Go to sleep , ” I said .   
The computers went dark .
I had to fish through three coarse paper bags of groceries that we ’d stowed under one of the tables to find the food supplies .   
A small bag of lime and chili chips , a protein bar , some preservatives with pepperoni stick added in , more stick - shaped preservative packs with cheese in the mix , dried fruit , two bottles of vitamin water , and a large thermos of regular tap water Breakfast .
Laptop .   
I flipped it open and turned it on .   
The agenda for the day was laid out in glowing words against a dark background .   
More groups would walk through .
I had messages from the night prior .   
Fume Hood .   
Another friend and support .   
Hero teams planning to patrol in Cedar Point .   
Other , related things .   
There was a vein of positivity running through it all .   
The hero teams reaching out , expressing interest , wondering about the response they ’d gotten , or expressing curiosity about villains who ’d showed their faces but had n’t been involved .   
Who was that guy ?   
What ’s her history ?
It was easy to be standoffish , to draw lines in the sand when it came to jurisdictions , to make territorial noises and see the other teams as competition .
This was a balancing act , but there were benefits .   
The heroes we were connecting with knew some of our names , faces , and voices .
The clock told me it was a quarter after six in the morning as I left the headquarters .
My feet left the fire escape and touched down in Cedar Point a few minutes later .   
The shifting temperature and the proximity of the water cast Cedar Point in a heavy mist .   
There were n’t many lights on , but the ones that were on made the surrounding mist glow .
Not many people awake .
I walked along the rooftops , flying up to the points higher than I could get with a skip or a jump .   
Briefly , I turned on my forcefield .
Briefly , I saw the mist stir , as facial features and hands moved through it .   
If I had n’t known what I was looking at , I would n’t have been able to make much sense of the swirl here , the vaguely oval void there .
It was n’t a good feeling , to verify that , but I ’d treated my heart gently this morning , armoring it in sentiment .   
I could take that much .
I sat on the edge of a random rooftop , got my laptop out , and opened it .
There was n’t internet here , but I had files saved on my computer .   
Random pictures I ’d saved , old PRT documents I ’d scanned and saved for printing for my collection , that I had n’t gotten around to deleting or printing , and some things I ’d typed up for the Patrol block .
One leg folded under me , the other dangling off the edge of the roof , I poised the laptop on my knee and dug for what I could find on costumes and branding .   
I created seven folders , one for myself and one for each of the six members of the team , and began copying files over to each , where relevant .
The pepperoni sticks were stale , brittle and tough enough I had to gnaw on them to soften them enough to bite through .   
Tasty , though .
A small truck beeped with surprising loudness as it backed into an alley .   
One person got out to guide it , waving and gesturing , as the headlights of the truck illuminated him in the fog .
The truck fully backed in , he turned around .   
Pausing , he looked up at me on the rooftop .   
He raised an arm .
I packed up my laptop and hopped off the roof .   
I landed silently behind him .   
He wore a jacket with a lime green reflective vest over it , and the combination made him look much bulkier than he was .
“
You ’re the one who knocked Moose on his ass , ” he said .
“
Yeah .
”
“
Just … hanging around with your computer ?
”
I shifted my bag at my shoulder .
“ I saw the glow of the screen , ” he said .
“
Felt like I should make a stake .   
It ’s easy to show up during the daylight hours , but it means something else if I could be here at midnight or at six in the morning .   
It ’s interesting that it seems like the people who keep watch
have n’t responded to me yet .
”
“
Yeah ?
” he asked .   
“ Huh .
”
“
What ’s in the truck ?
”
“
Produce , ” he said .   
“
It ’s not a good haul .   
My buddy back at the depot picked up a box of melons , it was liquid .   
Sloshed himself in watermelon juice , shoulder to toe .   
Long day of work ahead of him .
”
“ Just shipping it out , leaving it to the stores to complain ?
”
“ I guess they hope enough people wo n’t bother that it balances out .
” I nodded .
“
What do you think ?
” he asked .   
He extended an arm .
I drew in a deep breath .
“
About Cedar Point , ” he clarified .
“
I think this place is going to get wrapped up in a war , ” I said .
“
Yeah ?
” he asked .   
“
Because of the heroes coming through ?
”
“ Because it ’s building up to something , whatever the people in charge seem to want , ” I said .   
“
The war is going to start here or it ’s going to come here .
”
“
Should my buddy and I get out ?
” he asked .
“ You might want to , ” I said .
“ We pay a fee to do business here , our manager covers that , but we have to face down the people in costume who collect the fee and give us a hard time , too .   
Boss ca n’t handle that .   
Stuff off the boats and trains has n’t been as good lately , profit margins are getting slimmer .   
Maybe we ’ll try telling the manager it ’s not worth it .
”
“
Is it a problem ?   
The heroes being here ?
”
He had to think about it .
“
Yes , ” he said .
“
Okay , ” I responded .
“
But it ’s a necessary one , ” he added .
It meant a lot to me , to hear that .   
I held myself to the idea that if I could n’t trust the law , I could trust what was right .   
If I could n’t trust either , I could reach out .
I could n’t trust the law .   
It was in flux .   
Natalie was trying to predict it , but it was more question mark than full stop .   
As for what was right , I was n’t sure I could trust myself , and I could n’t trust the team .   
Jessica could give me some direction , tell me that I was all clear if I kept an eye out , to nudge .   
The other teams could validate and suggest they liked this direction .   
Collaboration , at least , felt right .
Reaching out , I could get some affirmation from this nameless guy in a reflective green vest .
“
Thank you , ” I said .
“
You said war , ” he said .   
“ Not a battle ?
”
“ I think it matters more , ” I said .   
“
There are other places .   
They ’ll follow suit .   
The entire city might change course , depending on what happens .
”
“ Huh .    
I ’m
Jerry , by the way , ” he introduced himself .   
He pulled off a glove to extend his hand my way .
“ Victoria .
”
“
No hero name ?
”
“
No hero costume , ” I said .   
“
Yet .
”
“
Can I give you a nod or a wave if I see you , while you ’re hanging around , then ?
”
“
Better not .   
When the villains are awake , they ’ll be keeping an eye on things .   
With powers .
”
“
No shit ? ”
“ On everything , ” I said .
“ I might talk to my boss , then , ” he said .   
“ Sounding more like I should stay clear .
”
“
Good , ” I said .
“
And you ’ll be here , then ?   
Staking a claim ?   
Preparing for war ?
”
“
Making sure that if nothing else , instead of it being fifty villains and no heroes , it ’s fifty villains and one hero .   
It ’s me being ridiculous , but I feel like that ’s important .
”
“ Lonely , ” he said .
“
Nah , ”
I said .   
“
I think I ’ll have allies when it counts .
” ⊙ The entire group arrived pretty much all together .   
Tristan , Ashley , Sveta , Chris , and Kenzie .   
The westbound train arrived at twelve - thirty , and the eastbound train was just shy of ten minutes later .   
Delays and other passing trains changed things up , but it seemed if the group wanted to meet at the station and walk together , they could .
“ Here already , ” Ashley observed .
“
Yep , ” I said .   
I held up a hand as Kenzie walked past , and she gave me a high - five .
“ Cool jeans , ” she said , without turning .
“
Thank you , ” I said .   
She went straight to her desk , kicking the cube that sat on the ground by her chair to boot it up before falling back into her chair and hitting the lever to boost herself up .
“
Did you see the emails from the other teams ?
” Tristan asked .
“
Yes , ” I said .
“
No , ” Ashley said .
“ I ’ll show you in a moment .   
You ’ll like it , ” Tristan said .   
“
They were talking some
and they like this .   
Cedar Point was a thing that was bothering a lot of people , I think .
”
“ Civilians too , maybe , ” I said .   
“
I dropped in early enough the villains were n’t really awake .   
Talked to a few .   
Feelings on heroic intervention range from positive to mixed .   
Considering that feelings on heroes are mixed in the first place …
”
“ We were talking , thinking I ’d pay a visit , ” Chris said .   
“
Keep them on their toes .
”
“
I ’d rather wait , ” I said .   
“ Rain said his trigger group would be out of commission for a few days while repairing and healing from injuries .   
It ’s been a few days .   
They were hiring people , and they probably wo n’t wait too long before they use those hires , or else those people might get caught up in other activities .
”
“ I ’m primed to do something , and I think you guys would rather I do it there than in here , ” Chris said .   
“
We ’ve got-
what , two teams coming through today ?
”
“ Two with a third holding back .   
Third one is a single cape , they want to actually do something , ” Tristan said .
“ We need to discuss that one , ” I said .
“
They ’re paying , ” he said .   
“ If we give him clear directions on how to ruin a villain ’s day , he ’ll pay us two hundred bucks .   
It ’s a good precedent .
”
“ People are coming through , ” Chris said .   
“ If we need it , I ’ll be a distraction .   
I ’m quick
, I ’ll be in and out .
”
“ Maybe , ” Tristan said .   
He looked at me and Ashley .
“
It was the original plan , ” Ashley said .   
“ I say let him .
”
I made a so - so gesture .
“
Yeah , ” Tristan said .   
“
We ’ll debate it when the time comes .   
It ’s anxiety ?
”
“
Yep .   
Mad Anxiety .
”
“ Great , ” Tristan said .   
“
It ’s not the screaming one , is it ?
”
“ Mad is the screaming one , ” Chris said .   
“
I wanted to make an impact and if we need me as a distraction then screaming is good .
”
Tristan said something Spanish under his breath and went to his whiteboard .   
Swear words , if I had to guess .
“ I ’ll go in , ” Ashley said .   
“
We said I would after a few days , and if things are happening , I want to already be recognizable around there .   
Will the eye camera be ready ?
”
“
Yes , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Oh , Victoria , I bought some energy drinks if you want them .   
And I have a thermos of a coffee
my dad and mom really like .
”
“
What coffee ?
” Sveta asked .   
“
Weld and I were trying to find one he might like , but it turned out he wants it super bitter , because that ’s the only way he can taste it .   
We had a bunch of things of coffee taking up space , and I took it on myself to drink it .   
I even gave some away .
”
“
You should bring it in , ” Tristan said .   
“ Supply the team .
”
“ I ca n’t believe it did n’t occur to me .   
Except I can , because I do n’t think about what I have in the cupboards
unless I ’m standing in front of an open cupboard .   
I have other stuff .
”
“ How far has this food experiment with Weld gone ?
”
I asked .
So it went , the conversation sprawling , back and forth , casual , from work to life .
I ’d woken up before dawn , taken the necessary time to pull myself together , and then tentatively reached out , to make sure I was n’t just centered in my own self , but in what I was doing .   
Reaching out to make sure it seemed right and , to a slightly lesser extent , that it was within the bounds of the law .   
Reaching out , too , to have more contacts .
I had a bad feeling .   
No , more than that , I had bad feelings .   
About the team , what lay beneath the surface , the war over Cedar Point , the Fallen , the clash between Snag ’s group and the Fallen , and the danger to Rain .
But I knew why I was here .   
A potential disaster lurked here .   
Knowing that made everything easier , in an ironic way .   
The dissonance of not feeling right about being here had eased .
There were clear , defined , acceptable enemies to face down .
“
I do n’t want a wig , ” Ashley said , to Sveta .
“
I ’m saying , if you cut your hair-
”
“
If . ”
“
Then it ’s an option .   
It could even give you a secret identity .   
Kenzie , the eye thing you were talking about , you can give Ashley eyes with irises , right ?
”
“ I could .
”
“ Eye color , hair color , clothes , ” Sveta said .
“ Wigs get pulled off or lost in a fight , ” Ashley said .   
“
It ’s undignified .
”
“
You do realize I ’m wearing a wig .
”
“ I realize you ’re wearing a wig
and you have the capacity to pound someone
’s face in or dangle them off the side of a building .   
They ’ll learn to respect you if you make them , ” Ashley said .
“ You do realize we ’re supposed to be heroes , right ?
” Chris said .   
“
Nominally ?
”
“ Not nominally , ” I said .
“
What ’s nominally ?
” Kenzie asked .   
“
How do you spell it ?   
I ’ll ask the computer .
”
“
And I ’m not about to do any of those things , ” Sveta said .
Ashley ignored us .   
“
Me ?   
I can kick them , or I can turn them into a bloody smear using my power .   
That ’s pretty much it .   
I do n’t have the manual dexterity or hand strength to use a weapon , I ca n’t punch them without damaging my hands .   
Kicks wo n’t do enough , using my power does too much , and the mess would be inconvenient .   
I do n’t want a wig .
”
“ You do n’t want a wig .   
Fine , ” Sveta said .
“ I have some images on my computer , ” I said .   
“ Hair and eye makeup , some costume related .
”
“
Show me ?
”
Ashley asked .
We walked over to where my computer was on a table .   
I found the folder and opened it .
Sveta leaned over me , half - hugging me from behind as I clicked through the images .
“
I was thinking of a name to do with swans , ” Ashley said , as I clicked .
“
An awful lot of the bird names are taken , ” I said .   
“
It was a trend once .   
What were you considering ?
”
“ Swansong , ” she said .   
“
If I go with the white costume .
”
“ I can check , but I ’d have to go through my paper stuff , ” I said .
“ Is n’t that kind of a bad omen of a name ?
”
Sveta asked    “ Like , last dance or ‘ I ’m going to retire today’ ?
”
“ I like bad omens , ” Ashley said .
“ I like this one , ” I said , indicating an image .   
“
I have a folder for you too , Sveta ,
just so you know .
”
“
I ’m curious what you ’re thinking .
”
“ All over the place , ” I said .   
“ Lots of stuff where I might not even remember why I saved the image in your folder .
”
“ Guys , ” Tristan said .
He had our attention .   
His phone was to his ear .
“ Rain ’s nearby .   
He wants to know if he can bring Erin .
”
Just like that , the mood of the room shifted .
We exchanged looks , and there were tentative nods , some real nods , no vetoes or refusals .
Tristan gave the a - ok .   
He hung up .
The silence lingered for a few seconds .
“ I like Erin , ” Kenzie said .   
“
And I ’m really glad
Rain ’s coming back so soon .
”
“ Yesterday was hard on him , ” Tristan said .   
“
And … Coño , it was his night last night .
”
“ His night ?
” I asked .
“
His dream , ” Tristan said .   
“
It ’s always hard .
”
“
Sounds like a good dream to me , ” Chris said .
Tristan picked up an eraser from by the nearest whiteboard and threw it at Chris .
“
I like this one , ” Ashley said .   
She tapped the frame of the laptop screen .
“ Elaborate , ” Sveta said .   
“
You ’d have to draw it on every time you went out in costume .
”
“
It could be projected , ” Ashley said .
“ It could , ” I said .   
“
If it ’s easy to do , we could do that .   
I think the thing to do would be to make sure you look good if the projector breaks or loses power , and then build on that .
”
“ Like the wig idea , ” Sveta said .
Ashley sighed .
Rain opened the side door of the headquarters , letting Erin in first before following .
I ’d gathered myself together earlier in the day .   
For the first time since the Patrol block job , I felt like I almost had my feet under me .
Tristan had said Rain had dealt with a hard night on top of a hard yesterday .   
It showed .   
Something hollowed out , something wounded .   
He looked like I ’d felt after Snag had gotten his hands on me .
When he approached the table next to his whiteboards , Erin stepped back a little to let him pass .   
It was a subtle thing that I could n’t help but notice , but it played into the second half of my observation of him .   
That he seemed more dangerous .   
Where I felt stronger because I ’d pulled myself together
some and clarified my direction with Mrs. Yamada , Rain conveyed something more in how he ’d come undone .
Even yesterday , his face swollen on the one side , black eye , cuts and scabs , it had seemed that idea had held true as he ’d found the strength to reveal his background .
What had he dreamed , last night , that this was what had come to the surface ?   
Was this the strength of desperation ?   
Something else ?
Rain greeted Tristan first , almost falling forward in a ‘ bro’ half - hug with just the one arm , the pat on the shoulder .
He gave a nod to Ashley as she was closest to him as he rounded the table .   
Sveta gave him a pat on the shoulder , a smile , and a few murmured words that got Rain to nod a little , his expression relaxing a little in what might have been a smile for someone else .   
She left us to go talk to Tristan .
Rain stopped a distance away from me .   
He did n’t quite face me , and instead said , “ We good , Kenz ?
”
“
Yup .   
I ’m glad you came .   
And you brought Erin .   
You want to see my toys , Erin ?
”
Erin walked from the side door to Kenzie , but ninety - five percent of her attention was on Rain and me .   
I had n’t quite seen her like this .
I had n’t seen Rain like this .   
He almost swayed where he stood , eyebrows slightly furrowed , clearly in deep thought .
I did n’t like the Fallen .   
They scared the shit out of me .   
I hated everything they represented .   
He ’d killed people , children , and it did n’t seem right that he was standing here and that was passing without incident .
Maybe his condition , mental and physical , represented just how hard he was fighting to get free .   
Maybe it suggested it was n’t passing without incident .
I put out my hand .   
When he went to shake it , I grabbed him by the wrist , instead .
He flinched at the unexpected gesture , looked to one side , and stared off into space momentarily .   
There was a part of me that recognized that too .
Bad dreams .
He forced his attention back to us and our exchange , looked down at our hands .   
He took my wrist .   
A clasp , more than a shake .
“
We good ?
”
he asked , not making eye contact .   
His voice was faintly rough - edged , like he ’d screamed himself hoarse .   
As if a small part of Snag had found root in Rain ’s throat .
“
We ’re good , ” I said .
“
Let ’s get ourselves organized , ” Tristan said .   
“ Training wheels are off , and we ’ve got a few things going on today .   
Ashley ’s going back in , and it makes sense to insert her before things get messy .   
Two hero teams are swinging through sometime after that , we ’ve got Chris on standby and one hero who wants to pay us to get a chance to do something , which we ’ll want to discuss . ”








“ Maybe trouble , ” Kenzie said .
I was digging through my bag when she said it .   
I set some of my things aside and headed to the front of the room .   
Erin was standing beside Kenzie , while Kenzie regaled her with stuff .
Rain was thirty feet away , sitting in his computer chair in his nook .   
Some of the tables we ’d arranged were situated so the long side was against the wall , but in the interest of giving Rain some desk space , we ’d set up two so the shorter ends of the table were against the wall and the tables jutted out into the room , his whiteboards against the wall between the tables .   
He ’d unfurled a roll of paper tablecloth , laid out his arms on it , and was using marker to draw on the tablecloth and make references .
His bag was open , and I could see the jaws of a bear trap and a bit of chain within .
He looked up , met my eyes , then looked at the screen .   
He remained where he was .   
He , Sveta and I were the ones who hung back a bit .   
Him because of his work , and Sveta and I
because we were rummaging in our bags .
“ Continuation of a bit of family drama , ” Kenzie said .   
She hit a few keys .   
The camera ’s image on the screen focused in on one section and rotated .
Nailbiter and a teenaged girl were standing outside of the nail place where Ashley had been comparing her nails to the outdated example images in the window .   
A middle - aged woman with bleached blonde hair was holding the teenager ’s wrist .   
The angle did n’t allow for a very good view of Nailbiter or her expression .   
She did n’t seem to be doing anything to step in .
The teenager had a resemblance to her mother , but was slender .   
Her hair reminded me of how Byron wore his
, it was the same medium - long length , slicked straight back from the face , but the teenager ’s was bleached where Byron ’s was black .   
In facial features and in expression , the teenager was a younger mirror of her mom .   
Neither was happy with the other .
“
What ’s this ?
” I asked .   
“
What ’s the drama ?
”
“
The girl is Colt .   
She was working for her parents , but business was slow , they were n’t paying her , and now she ’s working for Nailbiter .
”
“ Working how ?
” Tristan asked .
“ Muscle , I guess ?
” Kenzie asked .
“
She ca n’t weigh more than a hundred and thirty pounds , ” Tristan said .
“
Okay , well , she ’s hanging out with Nailbiter
and she ’s getting paid , I think ,
because she ’s had new clothes lately , ” Kenzie said .
“ You ’ve been watching her ?
” I asked .   
“
How do you know all of this ?
”
“
I ’m not watching her   watching her .  
That makes it sound like I ’m being creepy spying on people .   
Geez .   
It ’s because they keep having shouting matches at night , and idle cameras go on alert mode at loud noises , so I end up hearing stuff .
”
“
So you ’re being creepy eavesdropping on people , ” Chris said .
Kenzie glanced around her desk .   
“
I ’d throw something at you if I could find something I ’m
okay breaking .
”
“
Family issue , okay , but what ’s going on now ?
” Tristan asked .
“
And do we need to step in ?
” I asked .
“ I do n’t know , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Colt left the place to go talk to Nailbiter on the street , and they started to leave when Colt ’s mom , Tammy , went after her and stopped her .   
Her sister , who ’s about my age , she went outside with Tammy the mom and ran back inside .
”
“ Audio ?
” Sveta asked .
Kenzie hit a key .
Chris asked , “ Who names their kid Colt ?   
Or is that a shitty nickname ?
”   
Chris ’s second question had him inadvertently talk over the start of the audio feed .   
Kenzie shushed him .
“
… cking let me go ! ”
“
Get inside !   
You ’re still in trouble for stealing !
”
“
Fuck you !   
I deserved something !
”
“
She ’s been helping , you have n’t !
”
“
The one time she helps , you decide to pay her , and I get fuck all because it ’s the one time I decided to go out instead ! ?   
Fuck that , fuck you !
”
“
Is this how we ’re doing this ! ?
”
the mom screamed at Nailbiter , ignoring her daughter for the moment .
“
You want money from us while you ’re scaring away the business , and now you ’re taking my little girl , too ! ?
”
“
I ’m not fucking little ! ”
“
She decides , ”
Nailbiter ’s voice had a slight whistle around the words .   
“
I ’m
losing patience , Colt .   
If I walk away from here without you , I ’m not bringing you along again .
”
“ I decide , not her !
”
the mother raised her voice .   
“
I ’m the mother !
”
“ Then the two of you need to decide , ” Nailbiter said .   
“
Now .
”
Colt hauled back , her arm still in the firm grip of her mother ’s two hands .
I looked at the door .   
If I flew over now- A sound of an impact made me look back to the screen .   
Colt
’s
mother had turned away .   
Colt had her free hand raised .   
She ’d slapped her mother .
Her mother moved to retaliate , and Colt pulled back out of the way .   
There was n’t much heart behind the swing , either .   
Not for the mom .   
The teenager tugged to try to free her arm , and when she could n’t , she swung again .   
Not a slap this time , but a punch .
Kenzie looked away before the second punch could land .   
She did n’t look back for the third or fourth .
“
Shitty name girl
’s got grit , ” Chris said .
“
No , ” I said .   
“
I do n’t think that ’s grit .
”
“ Colt !
”
the father hollered the word , on emerging from the nail salon .   
Colt backed away , arm free of her mother ’s grip , while the father advanced .
Nailbiter stepped forward and to the side , to put herself between Colt and her father .   
The father stopped in his tracks .   
He looked at his wife , then leaned over for a closer look , touching her cheek where it already looked like it was going to be a heck of a bruise .
He and his wife stood together as they squared off against Nailbiter .
“
She ’s mine , now , ” Nailbiter said .
“
Are you , Colt ?
” the father asked .   
He got angrier as he talked , “ Are you hers ?   
You ’d hit your mother , who sacrificed so much for you ?
”
Colt looked spooked , in that moment .   
Kenzie zoomed the camera in further , moving the mouse .
It was Erin who said something .   
“
Say no .
”
“
Fine .   
I ’m hers , ” Colt said .   
“
Fuck this .   
At least she pays me .
”
“ Brave sounding words , while you ’re standing behind her .   
You ’re not going to stand aside , let us handle this as a family ?
”
“
No , ” Nailbiter said .   
“
She ’s an employee .
”
“ I do n’t want trouble , ” the father said .   
“
We can leave it at this .
”
“ If you want , ” Nailbiter said .
“
Good , ” Colt said .   
“
Leave it and fuck off .
”
“
Do n’t come home , ” the father said , and his voice was hard , now .   
“
Do n’t show your face in front of me , your mother , or Reese again .   
Be her errand girl .   
I ’m done trying with you .
”
Colt was silent .
“
Patience lost , ” Nailbiter said , the dry whistle catching on the ‘ s’ of Lost .   
“
I ’m going .
”
“
Mom ?
”
Colt asked .   
I heard her ask that , and I wondered if she wanted her mother to grab her , to drag her away .
“
What are you asking me for ?
”
Tammy asked , one hand at the side of her face .   
“ If you ’re going to go , then go .
”
“
Yeah ?
”
Colt asked .   
She spat the words , “ Fuck you .
”
“ I ’ll be by next week to collect , ”
Nailbiter said .   
“
See you then .
”
Another whistle on the ‘ s’ of ‘ see.’    Nailbiter and Colt walked away .   
The father hugged his wife .
“
Is this kidnapping ?
” Sveta asked .
“
No , ” Tristan said .
I shook my head .   
“
We could call authorities , but I have a hard time believing we ’ll be able to get cops out there , and have them take action with a nearly-18 person who does n’t want to cooperate or go back home .
”
“ Having the police show up to take her away might make her dig her heels in more , ” Sveta said .
“ Stupid , ” Erin said .   
“ So fucking stupid .   
Colt and her parents both .
”
Her eyes were a touch moist as she shook her head , arms crossed , and ducked past Sveta and I. “ Too close to home ?
” Sveta asked .
“ I ca n’t talk about home .   
Sorry .   
Give me a second .
”
“ Okay , ” Sveta said .   
She met my eyes .
I had worries , but they were ones
I ’d rather not voice aloud .   
Nailbiter had a history that had seen her arrested and sentenced harshly , without much delay .   
Post - Gold Morning , she ’d settled back into her role as a violent cape , serving as what might have been Beast of Burden
’s second in command .
She was calmer than she ’d been reported to be in the one article I ’d been able to dig out of my boxes of notes , part of an article from a magazine , listing the Birdcage ’s residents at the time .   
The last page of the article , annoyingly , had n’t been preserved .   
I ’d pulled the page out for whatever article or image was on the other side .
Either way , violent , as might have been expected for an ex - con with rusty nails instead of teeth .   
Prison and nine years might have changed her a bit from the person described in the article , but I doubted Colt was in good hands .
“
Okay , ” I said .   
“ We do n’t want to ignore this .   
I ’ll make some calls later .   
I ’ll see what I can find on Nailbiter .   
She was from North Carolina , I think , and some of their capes are still around .   
I ’d have to track down a veteran .   
We ’ll see what we ’re up against .   
If I get a chance , I ’ll have a conversation with her .
”
“
And say what ?
” Chris asked .   
“ Parents do n’t want her , intense nails - for - teeth lady does .
”
“ She did n’t want to go , and I think her parents wanted her to stay , ” Tristan said .
“ ‘ I never want to see your face again’ sounds like a real term of endearment , ” Chris said .
“ If she ’s with Nailbiter , ” Tristan said .
“
I ’ll talk with her , ” I said .   
I looked at Ashley .   
“
Given the crowd you ’re likely to run into while you ’re over there , there ’s a chance you may see her .
”
“
She hit her mom , several times , ” Ashley said .
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“
Her mom was willing to hit her back .   
Colt learned that behavior from someone .
”
“
You ’re assuming she picked that up from her parents ?   
That ’s a bit of a leap .   
We ca n’t know for sure , ” I said .
“ We can guess , ” Ashley said .
“
But we ca n’t know , ” I said .   
“
It ’s … far from great , that situation , Colt , her parents .   
Maybe think about what you might say or do if you run into her .
”
Ashley shook her head slightly .
“
No ?
”
“
I was thinking more about Nailbiter , ” Ashley said .
“
Okay , you should already know she ’s dangerous , ”
I said .
“
I ’m more dangerous ,
I ’m not worried .   
I want to go .   
Sooner than later .
”
“ Do you still want to do the eye thing ?
” Sveta asked .
“
If possible .   
I ’ll take my mask off when I ’m with others .
” Sveta turned to me .   
“
Did you find anything usable ?
”
“ Mascara .
”
“ I have stuff , plus the white cover - up .   
Erin ?   
Do you have anything ?
”
“ I have stuff , ” Erin said .   
“
What are you doing ?
”
It was a series of last - minute tasks , Sveta , Erin and I helping do up Ashley
so she could present a good face .   
Kenzie was high - energy , switching from watching to fiddling with the yet - to - be inserted eye camera to talking to Chris about what he was doing when he went out .
“
Any word on Snag ’s group ?
”   
Rain asked .   
Ashley was in a chair with her back to the table Rain was using for work on his hands .
“
We ’ve seen Snag and Love Lost around , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Love Lost more than Snag .   
She was in a bad mood yesterday .   
She went away for a while .
”
“ Snag is tinkering , and if Victoria ’s description of how he operates was any clue , he can tap into his other powers through his tech , ” Rain said .   
He slapped something metal down on the table , hard .   
“
And I ’m struggling with something that should be simple .
”
“ I want to talk to you about tinker stuff after , ” Kenzie said .
“ I had some small arms for you to mess with , but they got broken , ” Rain said .   
“
I have the contact pads .
”
“
Awesome , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I think we can figure something out .
”
Ashley was patient as we applied some white and black eyeliner , then used Sveta ’s cover - up to fix the color around the eyes .
“ I wish I could do this , ” Sveta said .   
She was handling the holding of the various brushes and objects , so we could hand one to her and take another .   
“
But my hands ca n’t hold the brushes and pencils , and I would n’t feel safe with my tendrils out so close to Ashley
’s face .
”
“ Tendrils , ” Erin said .
“ I do n’t know what Rain told you , but I ’d probably accidentally rip out Ashley
’s eye .
”
“ If they do a bad job , we can wash it off and you can try , ” Ashley said .   
“ If you rip out my eye , then I ’ll have the intimidation effect I want .   
Of a different sort .
”
“
Of course , ” Sveta said , with an unusually sarcastic tone .   
“
You ’re fine with losing an eye , that ’s badass .   
But you ca n’t wear a wig , because if it was knocked off , that would be embarrassing .
”
Ashley sighed .   
I nearly stabbed her in the nose with the eyeliner pencil .
“
Do n’t move , ”
I told her .
I finished with the eyeliner , and stepped back to admire the work .   
A white line along the lower lid , to make the eyes appear larger , and black mascara , because her eyelashes were apparently white without .   
Erin had handled the careful application of fine veins of black eyeliner that fanned out from the eyes in parallel with the eyelashes .   
They had been drawn in waves with each wave washed out with pats of the white cover - up , so the lines appeared to fade out and have dimension .   
At each corner of each eye , I ’d drawn a hooked triangle , with the hook pointing down at the inner corners and up at the outer ones .
Erin had a bit of the softer , artistic touch for the lines and
fading - out , I had the steadier hand for the line work .
The only mirror was a compact mirror , too small to show everything , so I took a picture instead .   
I showed Ashley .
“
Good , ” she said .   
She smiled .
“
Stay put , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Eye camera .   
Here we go , and I ca n’t touch your face because    I do n’t want to smudge the nice makeup .
”
“ Camera first next time , then , ” Ashley said .
Erin clearly had the heebie jeebies , as Kenzie held the needle within a few inches of Ashley ’s eye , swinging it within half of an inch of the eye as she rotated one part to get it tighter .
“
Okay , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Here we go .   
Same as before , but do n’t flinch and keep your eye fixed on one point .   
Making contact on three , ready ?
”
“
Ready .
”
“
Zero , one , two , thre- wait .
”
Ashley stayed stock still , waiting .
“ Haha , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I should turn it on first , or it wo n’t phase in .   
That would ’ve been a mess .
”
“ Would ’ve ruined my makeup .
”
“
On three , this time .   
Zero , one , two , three .   
Can you feel it this time ?
”
Erin shook her arms , as if she could n’t shake off the goosebumps , and walked away , her back to the scene .
“ I feel like it ’s there , but it does n’t feel five percent there .
”
“
And … ” Kenzie held up another , shorter needle .   
“ For the effect .   
On three .   
Zero , one , two , three .
”
Kenzie stepped back .   
Ashley ’s pupils were gone .
“ Ta da !
”
“ Projection ?
”
“ Super low tech , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I put liquid eraser on the projection caps , which are n’t phased in .   
It ’s not perfectly matched to the rest of her eyes , but it works if you are n’t looking super close .
”
I took a photo and showed Ashley .
She stood from her seat , and bent over , hand on Kenzie ’s shoulder , planting a kiss on the very top of Kenzie ’s head .
“
You like it ?
”
“
It ’s good .
”   
Ashley looked at Sveta , Erin , Kenzie and I , and then said , “ Thank you .
”
With that , she put her mask on carefully , eyes still decorated behind the eyeholes , and walked briskly on her way .
“
I feel pretty good about how we did there , ” Erin said .   
“
Can you send me the picture ?
”
I passed a copy of the picture to her phone .
She checked she had it , then smiled .   
“ Thank you .
”
“ Not a problem .
”
“
It ’s nice to have something .   
I have n’t had many wins lately .
”
“
Are you doing okay ?
”
I asked .
She shook her head .
“
Anything I can do ?
” I asked .
“
This is cool , superheroes , distractions , ” she said .
“ I was super into this cape stuff once .   
And this stuff helps Rain , in a roundabout way .   
Which might end up helping me .
”
Rain was at his whiteboard , scribbling furiously in red marker .   
He ’d written a list of ten items , and he was erasing all but the bottom three , the aggressive side - to - side motion of the eraser making the whiteboard rattle against the wall .
“ Rain ?
” I asked .
He stopped , still facing his whiteboard .   
“
I had ten ideas on things I wanted to try .   
I did some napkin level tinker - notes and found out tolerances are lower than I thought .   
Scratch eight ideas ,
now I have two , which is probably going to become zero when I do the next set of calculations .
”
“ Being a tinker is hard sometimes , ” Kenzie said .
“ Kenzie , ” Rain said .   
He brought one hand up to his forehead , back still to the room .   
“ If I could build one of the things I ’ve seen you make , I ’d be happy .
”
“
Sorry , ” Kenzie said .
“ I ca n’t do stuff .   
It ’s not hard , it ’s impossible .
”
“ Go easy , Rain , ” Tristan said .
“
I ’m
sorry
I touched a sore spot , ” Kenzie said .
Rain shook his head , turning around , hand still at his forehead .   
He dropped it , looked at Kenzie , then looked away .   
“
I do appreciate the thought .   
Yes , being a tinker sucks sometimes .
”
“
Maybe you can take a look at my tech later , ” Kenzie said .   
“
You can see if it inspires stuff .   
And you can explain the contact pads .   
Being a tinker might have its bad points , but we can be two tinkers working together .
”
“ I ’d like that , ” Rain said , and it sounded a touch forced .   
“
Yeah .
”
Kenzie ’s smile looked more forced than Rain ’s .
“
Why do n’t you take five minutes , step outside for some sun and fresh air ?
” Tristan asked .
Rain looked like he might resist .   
He looked at the board .
“
You ’ve said it helps , ” Sveta said .   
“
It ’s how you unwind .   
Nature and space to think .
”
“ I have , ” Rain said .   
“
Yeah .
”
“ If it ’s okay , I ’ll have the camera above the door turned on , so we can make sure you wo n’t get kidnapped , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Or
someone could keep you company .
” Rain nodded .   
“
Alone is good .   
The camera is fine .
”
“
Got it .
”
He paused at the door .   
“
You ’re great , Kenz .
”
“ Thank you .
”
“
I ’m
sorry
I ’m
shitty , that was n’t about you .   
I was ready to snap at anyone
, I was so frustrated at this stuff .
”
“
It ’s okay .
”
“ Go outside .   
Take a bit , ” Tristan said .
Rain stepped out onto the fire escape .   
The door slammed behind him , more because it was a heavy door than because he ’d actively slammed it .
“
He needs help , ” Erin said , quiet .
“
It ’s a bad situation , ” I said .
She nodded .
“
That was n’t about you , you know , ” I could hear Tristan telling Kenzie .   
“
He ’s stressed .
”
“ I know .   
But it is n’t cool .   
There ’s a big part of me that feels like it is about me .
”
“
It is n’t .   
Cool or about you .
”
I looked around the room .   
Chris was at his station at the point in the apartment furthest from the screens that was n’t inside the bathroom .   
He was bent over a video game .
The cameras were capturing video from high overhead .   
One came down at an angle , and the other was a bird ’s eye view , depicting only the tops of heads .   
Ashley had yet to arrive .   
The cameras tracked automatically , based on the people they recognized and their apparent importance .   
One was following Nailbiter and Colt .
But there was another measure of tracking : it seemed to judge by number .   
The other camera was shifting to look northward .   
The labels popped up as people were recognized , so distant they were barely more than stick figures .   
The labels congealed together into a single large label above the small crowd .   
Twelve unrecognized individuals .
“
We did n’t have a patrol coming through , did we ?
” I asked .
“ Not for an hour , ” Tristan said .   
He turned to look .   
“
Oh what ?   
Fuck me .
”
Kenzie ran past Erin , Sveta and me to get to her desk , seizing control of the cameras .   
She focused in on the crowd .
“
What ’s going on ?
” Tristan asked .
The costumes were distinct enough for me to recognize them before any icon came into view .   
Bold contrasts of light and dark , angles , armor panels , and bright colors .   
Masks tended to be full - face .   
All of it looked like they had one very tired designer working on their costumes .   
Cohesion to the max .
The camera caught the icon , and it popped up in a window , blur - corrected .   
A figure running to the side , drawn out as a collection of triangles and irregular shapes .   
Their arm was out and holding an arrow - shaped shield .   
Others had slight variants on the same icon , to play into costume textures and other minor details .
“ Advance Guard , ” I said .
“
We have n’t talked to Advance Guard , ” Tristan said .   
“ We actively avoided bringing Advance Guard into this .
”
I looked at Erin and touched her shoulder .   
“
Do you want to go
get Rain ?
”
She nodded .
A second screen was projected onto the wall to our left .   
The camera began gathering blurry portraits together , lining them up in three rows and four columns , each showing one mask .   
As the camera got better resolution shots , they were overlaid over other shots of the same person , the images clarifying in stages as each image was uploaded .   
Some details remained blurry , while others became bold and precise .
Rain entered the room .   
He approached the desk with arms folded , looking weary .
Everything was still clarifying as Chris exited the washroom and belatedly joined us .
Spright was one .   
Shortcut another .
“ They invited themselves ?
” I asked .
“
Fuck them if they did , ” Tristan said .   
“
This is our jurisdiction .
”
“ We can worry about that kind of thing later , ” Sveta said .   
“
Do we intervene ?
”
“
It could be a trap , ” Rain said .
“
He ’s right , ” Chris said .   
“ Prancer ’s supposed to try something .
”
“
We ’re supposed to think he paid off Advance Guard ?
” Tristan asked .
“
He could have , ” I said .   
“
They ’re money hungry , with fancy costumes and nice facilities .   
I ’ve had pretty mixed reactions dealing with them , too .
” Tristan frowned .   
“
Okay .   
I ’m
bothered they ’re just marching in here .   
Assuming it ’s not a trap , what ’s even their plan ?
”
“ The locals might have called for help , ” I said .   
“
Advance Guard could have been that help .
”
“
It has n’t been that long , ” Sveta said .
“
Twelve capes .   
Many I do n’t know or recognize .   
I do n’t want to rule anything out .
”
“ Makes sense .
”
“
They ’re good , ” Tristan said .   
“
And there ’s a lot of them .
”
“
But they ’re aggressive .   
Their usual M.O. is to blitz a target , ” I pointed out .
“ Not out of the question here , ” Tristan said .
Even though they were walking in as a group .   
The place being a peninsula mattered .   
It meant there were less routes to get in .   
It made it easier to keep watch .   
There would be eyes on Advance Guard , clairvoyant or no .
“ I should go , ” Chris said .   
“
I ’ll have my phone .   
If we need to do something , I can jump in .
”
“ Be careful , ” Tristan said .
“ I ’ll be fine .   
I ’ll change when I ’m close .   
Do n’t record me , Kenzie .
”
“
Why ?
”
“
Because I have to ditch the clothes , or I ’ll tear them to shreds .   
I ’ll be naked .   
I want privacy .
”
“
Okay , um , I ’m very fond of you , Chris , but despite the fact that everyone seems to think ‘ tinker camera’ and immediately think of that , the perverts , that ’s not how I operate .   
I do n’t want to see you naked , so you ’re good .
”
“
I ’m noting that you have n’t said you wo n’t record me .
”
“
I wo n’t record you , Chris !   
Relax !   
You ’d think you already did the anxiety thing .
”
“ I did , yesterday , to get home faster .
”
“ Okay , um- lost my train of thought .
”
“
That ’s a good thing , ” Tristan said , taking some authority .   
“ Chris , go .   
Kenzie , turn the cameras away .
”
“ I ’ll go too ,
” I said .
“
No .   
Hold back , ” Tristan said .
“ Hold back ?
”
Tristan said , “ Ashley ’s in there .   
We do n’t want her arrival to coincide with yours , and you ’ve shown up a lot .   
We already came pretty close with you and her being within a day of each other .   
Her being connected to Chris is less bad , and he wo n’t even be human .   
Let ’s keep them from making the complete connection .
”
I saw his hand move .   
Flat , at an angle , as if telling me to stop , but not quite stop .
He was trying to communicate something with me ?
Caution ?   
Something else ?
“
Okay , ” I said .
He gave me a little nod , turning back toward the screen .   
“
We send you in if it gets ugly .
”
“
Let ’s hope it does n’t , ” Rain said .
“
Is Ashley in their clairvoyant ’s usual range ?
” Tristan asked .
“
Yes , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Should we call her anyway ?
”
“
No , ” Tristan said .
I wanted to ask why he ’d signaled me , but I could hardly do that .   
I likely would n’t get an answer until this was over with .
The villains were gathering .   
The initial group that appeared was roughly the same size as Advance Guard ’s group .
I could see Kenzie ’s labels with the attached names .   
Love Lost was in the crowd of villains .   
Snag was absent .
Colt was hanging back , not far from Nailbiter .
On the wall , the Advance Guard mugshots were filling in .   
I looked for the familiar first and found them already named .   
Spright , Shortcut .
Mayday , Siren , ReSound , Gong …  
“
Mayday , ” Kenzie said .   
“
He was Baltimore .
”
Signal Fire , Flapper , Prong …
“
I trained under Signal in San Diego , too , ” Kenzie said , adding , “ I ’d really like to use that training someday soon .
”
“ Someday , ” Tristan said .
“ You dropped the ‘ soon’ , ” Kenzie said .   
“
We need to talk about that , after .
”
This was difficult enough without you getting involved , Advance Guard , I mused .
“
Every time I run into Advance Guard , it ’s a headache , ” I said .   
“
I run into the one incorrigible asshole in the group , their timing sucks , their choice of where to show up sucks , or it ’s more than one of the above .
”
“ Must be how Prancer feels , ” Tristan said .   
“ Heroes turning up out of nowhere .
”
The two groups advanced until they were in sight of each other .
One of the capes on Advance Guard ’s side held up a hand .   
She continued approaching until she stood halfway into no - man’s - land between the two factions .
Kenzie ’s computer blipped as the label connected to the individual at the front .   
ReSound was the spokesman , apparently .   
Her outfit had a lot of circles reminiscent of records or speakers , with the depthed concentric shapes and circles of color in the center of black circles .   
The icon on her chest was made of crescent shapes , not triangles , with the shield being a half - circle .
Prancer did n’t step forward to meet her , not immediately .   
Instead , he waited for a moment , surrounded by his allies .   
Velvet was in the crowd .   
Moose was absent .   
So were Hookline and Kitchen Sink .   
Some stragglers were catching up .
Ashley entered the street , and Kenzie ’s camera provided the label above her head : ‘ Swansong’ .
“ Should be Damsel , until she takes the name officially , ” I said .
Kenzie typed it out , replacing it .
Damsel was situated near the back of Prancer
’s group .   
Some people reacted , but nobody attacked or lashed out .
She did n’t even flinch at the people around her or the unexpected situation .   
She walked through the left side of the crowd , until she was near Prancer
’s left flank .   
She leaned against a wall , arms folded , and stared at him , rather than at Advance Guard .
Prancer did note her presence , and looked momentarily annoyed .
The annoyance seemed to spur him forward .   
He met ReSound at the middle of no man
’s land .   
The camera zoomed in to focus on them .
“
This is getting tiresome , ” Prancer said .
“
What ‘ this’ ?
” ReSound asked .   
I ’d expected her voice to sound altered , as many capes with sonic themes did , but she sounded normal .   
Confident .
“
The routine .   
You guys show up , you ’re interested in the area , but you do n’t commit .
”
“ We commit , ” ReSound said .
“
Hm ?   
I do n’t follow .
”
“ We ’re committing .   
We ’re staying for long enough to finish the job .   
We ’re here to break up the villains in Hollow Point .
”
“ Job .   
You were hired ?
”
“
We hired ourselves , ” ReSound said .   
“
We break up priority targets , and we got to talking .   
You guys seem priority enough .
”
“
Based on what ?
” Prancer asked .   
His composure had cracked , but he did n’t raise his voice so much as he allowed emotion to affect his words .   
“
We sell grass , we live here .   
We do n’t shit that much where we eat .
”
“
Who was it ?
” ReSound asked .   
“ Kitchen Sink .   
Hookline ?
”
“ They pointed you our way ?
”
“ Someone thought they were funny names , and they were joking about it-
” Tristan groaned out loud .
“
-and they would n’t say why they were here in the first place .   
They are n’t alone either .   
Others have been through .   
A lot of people find you very interesting .
”
“
We ’re very boring villains , really , ” Prancer said .   
“ Insignificant .
”
“ Houndstooth , no , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Ugghh .   
I recommended you .
”
“ It was fucking Foxtrot , ” Tristan said .   
“ Foxtrot is the clown in Houndstooth ’s group .
” ReSound was taking a moment to consider Prancer ’s claim of being boring .
“
I do n’t believe you , ” ReSound said .   
She offered a half chuckle and said , “ It does n’t matter .   
We do this , we get some points with the public , and with the current attitude about capes ?   
Points matter .
”
“ We outnumber you .
”
“ We train .   
I ’m sure you went to great efforts to get your people together .   
Did you watch us on your cameras , then make sure to bring in a few more , so you could say you outnumbered us ?
”
“ Cameras ?
” Prancer asked .
On camera , ReSound pointed skyward , not that far off from pointing directly at the camera we were using to watch the scene .
Some heads turned , following the pointing finger .
In the headquarters , Kenzie shoved her keyboard out of the way and brought her forehead down to the desk .
“
Not ours , ” Prancer said .
“
Again , I ’m not sure I believe you , ” ReSound said .
“ If you ’re going to doubt everything I say , why are we even talking ?
”
“
Because we always declare war , Prancer .
”
“
No .   
You ’re up to something .
”
“ What makes you think that ?
”
“
The fact this conversation feels like someone trying to keep me on the line so they can get a wiretap , doling out just enough information to keep me interested .   
We ’re done , ” Prancer said .   
“
Do n’t pick this fight .
”
Prancer was halfway back to his group when Advance Guard took action .
Spright .   
He dashed forward .   
Enhanced movement , straight for the Hollow Point group .   
If he was a speedster , he was n’t much of one .   
Faster than a normal human could manage , but hardly a blur .
“ Avant !
”
ReSound called out , and the sound was magnified , loud , echoing far faster than a normal echo could or should .   
The camera ’s sound died , dissolving into crackles .   
Several of the Hollow Point villains covered their ears .
Prancer was one of them .   
Spright ran past him , and the leader of the Hollow Point group flared .   
He became blurry around the edges , with the blur reaching out five feet in every direction .   
It subsided , but he retained the effect around his silhouette .   
The gold on his costume , from his mask to the deer ’s head in profile at his collarbone , with antler over one shoulder , all became larger , more intense , more like glass with amber colored lava within its confines .   
The green of his costume became smoky .
Breaker form .
But as he adopted the form , Spright used his own breaker form .   
It was n’t much different , and Spright managed to keep ahead of Prancer , running toward the thinnest ranks of the stunned villains .   
Toward Ashley .
She used her power , a blast to drive herself in Spright ’s direction , as she aimed to intercept .   
She was in the midst of people , which limited her options , so she ran several paces before she was clear to use another blast .
Still in breaker form , Spright reached out .   
A scintillating cloud of energy exploded from his hand .   
He used the recoil to change course .
Of course .
From there , it was a brawl .   
Spright disappeared into enemy ranks with his own powers exploding out around him .   
With the use of powers , he ducked and dodged between , went over , and slid under people .   
He made it out of the back of the crowd and dashed toward the deeper part of downtown .   
Ashley could n’t keep up , but Prancer could .
Love Lost staggered forward as ReSound maintained her sonic assault .   
One we could n’t hear or get a sense of , because the camera audio had died .
She ripped off her mask .   
Then she screamed back .   
Advance Guard was throwing up defenses before it seemed like the scream hit them .
I could n’t hear what it sounded like , but I could see the effect .   
The people who were n’t fully protected , ReSound included , were laid low .
Had it not been for shimmering forcefield - like barriers and strange crystal growths , she might have been able to hit the entirety of Advance Guard , aside from the absent Spright .   
As it was , she got maybe three or four .
“
The emotion attack , ” Rain said .
Resound ’s body language changed completely .   
A moment later , she lunged for Love Lost , swinging punches , grabbing .
The black haired woman did n’t let her make contact .   
She stepped back out of the way , raked with claws , avoided the grab , clawed again .   
With the second slash , blood was spilled .
The other affected people in Advance Guard were turning on teammates .   
Most shouted , silent with our lack of audio , rather than attack .
My first thought was , fuck Advance Guard .
My second thought was to register the blood .   
Blood .   
This is serious now .
“
I ’m going , ” I said .








We hurried to get ourselves put together .   
Tristan was often the one to take point on the organization side of things , but for the moment , he was ducking under a table , dragging out a plastic bin with his armor in it .   
No breath or focus to spare .
“
What are we doing ?
” Sveta asked .
“ I guess we all go , ” I said .   
“ Control the situation , then help the heroes , in that order ?   
Tristan ?
”
“
Yep , ” Tristan said , as he straightened up .   
He pulled off the v - neck long sleeved shirt he was wearing , undid the necklace with steel beads and
a metal ram ’s horn , and dropped them into a corner of the plastic bucket .   
He had his non - armor costume on under his clothes , form - fitting and covered in patterns that gave some character to what was visible in the gaps between the individual pieces of armor .
“
What can I do ?
”
Rain asked .
“ You come if you ’re up for it .   
Kenzie too .
”
“
Yes , ” Kenzie said , without hesitation .
“ I want you on the periphery , ” Tristan said , stressing the periphery part .   
“ Kenzie , you ’re staying close to me , you ’re backup and problem solving , we ’ll figure out where to park you and keep you as a reserve .
”
“
You ’re bringing me along ?
”
Kenzie asked , wide - eyed .
I listened and watched , pulling off my sweater with one hand , the other hand holding my camisole top in place .
Tristan answered her , “ I promised you I would .   
You can keep an eye on things with the cameras ?
”
“ I can , ” she said , enthused .   
“
Oh shoot !   
I need to get last minute costume stuff done , and I have it loaded with stuff for Chris .
”
She began rummaging , hurrying to get ready .
“
You want me along ?
”
Rain asked .
“ It might be best to have everyone along in some capacity .   
You stay far enough back
the clairvoyants ca n’t see you
and so you wo n’t run into Love Lost or the others .
”
“ Okay , ” Rain said .
“ Sveta and Victoria together .   
Erin ?   
Good to have you here ,
but- ” “ It would be weird if I stayed while you ’re all gone .   
I get it , ” Erin said .
I put on the sweatshirt .   
I ’d peeled off the previous design , and put on a new one .   
It was better than the mess before , a similar aesthetic , with the circle and stylized rays , but the lines curled more , reaching out to the seams of the sweatshirt , where they blended into thin black bars .   
The hood was framed with the same design .
More of my self - care , to get my outfit somewhat in order .   
I ’d done a little something to the mask , giving it some black accents , but it was still predominantly white .
Not that it mattered much .   
I did n’t place a serious priority on my secret identity .   
Anyone who could put two and two together would know my face , including the villains in Cedar Point .
Sveta applied her mask .   
She ’d taken one of the temporary masks , but in the time since we ’d gone out together , she ’d taken some art supplies to it .   
The same color scheme that covered her prosthetic exterior , with deep , dark blues and greens , neon oranges and yellows , now covered her mask .
“
That ’s great , ” I said , briefly , before applying my own , making sure it was symmetrical .
“
Thank you .   
The color rubs off , so it ’s only a temporary thing .
”
“ The masks are n’t meant to be long - term , ” I said .   
“ We ’re making do until we ’re more settled .
”
I plucked at my sweatshirt as I said it .
“
That ’s temporary then ?
”
“
Yeah , ” I said , giving her a hard look .   
I glanced back at the screen .   
“ Going to do something better , but I have to figure some stuff out first .
”
“
Okay , haha , I was worried I ’d have to dance around my friend having low standards for her costume , ” Sveta said .
I snapped my head to look around , and saw Sveta stick her tongue out at me .   
I gave her a light push .   
“ Fuck off , and not the time .
”
“
This is better than what you had before .
”
Baby steps .   
Better costumes as I figured out what I was doing .
What was I doing ?   
I could see the mob on the screen .   
I knew from my experience with the broken trigger that mobs were hard to wrangle .   
Adding my emotion power to the mix , when Love Lost ’s had already taken hold ?
More than anything , I wanted to think things through .   
I wanted to be intelligent in how I went about the cape thing , but there were times that could n’t happen .   
This time , where blood was being shed , was one .
If law , right and wrong , and the input of others did n’t serve to clarify matters , then I wanted to do what would weigh on me the least .   
I was glad that those least - weighty things were often the lawful and right ones .
It was selfish .   
If a time came in the future where I was disabled , with nothing to do but sit in a hospital room , thinking about the past and dreading my non - future , I did n’t want my memories to be something I had to endure , or things that soured on reflection .
I did n’t miss the fact that as that idea rolled through my head , the ‘ if’ of the idea had the faintest catch to it .
An idea to hold onto for when I saw my new therapist .   
When , not if .
“
I ’ll organize these guys , ” Tristan said .   
He was strapping on his armor .
“ I ’ll run to catch up .   
You two figure out what you ’re doing .   
Remember Chris and Ashley are out there .
”
I looked at the screen , looking at the labels of the capes involved in the fight .   
Prancer and Spright were maneuvering around each other in the middle of downtown , not far from the pub or Prancer
’s headquarters .   
Nailbiter had left the larger brawl and were giving chase .
Snag ’s name had appeared and was in the shifting jumble of labels over heads .
“
It ’s too chaotic ,
” I said .   
“
If we throw ourselves into that mess , I ’m going to hurt someone , Sveta is , or we ’re going to get hurt .
”
“
Go after Prancer and-
” Tristan turned his head to check the screen on the side .   
“ Spright .   
Keep an eye out for Love Lost and Nail .   
Do what you can .   
I ’ll signal you once
I ’m closer .   
We ’ll deal with the mob when we ’ve more of our own people around .   
Us stragglers will call Chris and the hero oversight .
”
“
Good , ” I said .
I did n’t want to waste more time .   
I pushed the door open , holding it for Sveta , and then took her hand .
I picked her up and flew .   
When I was higher than any of the buildings in the area , I paused to turn around in mid - air , looking down at the headquarters .
“
Something bothering you ?
” Sveta asked .
A lot of things were .
I flew toward Cedar Point .   
If I waited too long , Prancer and Spright would have moved on from the area
we ’d seen them .
“ Tristan .   
He ’s getting everyone out of there , ” I said , while we flew .   
I had to raise my voice to ensure I ’d be heard .
“
And ?
”
“
And-
it ’s like that riddle ,
” I said .   
“
The wolf , the chicken , the corn , a boat with room for the man and one thing in the boat at a time .   
He’s- ”
My voice dropped away as we drew close enough that I could hear the faint scream and the reverberation .   
I partially lost my train of thought .
“ I ’m not following you , ” Sveta said .
“
He ’s either pulling something or he ’s worried
someone else will , ” I said .   
“
He ’s taking possibly unnecessary steps .
”
I felt Sveta ’s arm move , where it was wrapped around my back .   
Tightening .
“ I do n’t like this , ” she said .   
I could barely hear her .
“
Me interpreting things like this ?   
Tristan ?   
Rain ?   
The awful puzzle analogy ?
”
“
Any of it , ” Sveta said .   
Her voice grew louder , so I could hear her properly again .   
“ I do n’t want to make this mistake again .
”
I wanted to ask , but I heard another scream .   
I could see a distortion in the air , as colors pulled away from trees and buildings as if they were watercolor or the color was multiplying , casting the surroundings into shades of red and purple .   
The effect was brief , and the distortion faded .   
No damage had been done to the surroundings .
I could feel the effect of it , even from a distance .   
My heart rate picked up , and for a moment my thoughts and feelings spooled out .   
There were a hundred things I was holding in my heart and head that had to sit there .   
There were worries , irritations , traumas , and causes for outright fucking fury that I could n’t do a damn thing about .   
Just being on the periphery of the effect made them swell up and jostle together .
Sveta ’s arm tightened around me .   
I could hear the thump , thump , thumpthump of her tendrils against the inside of her body .
I met her eyes .   
I could instantly tell that she ’d been affected more than I had .
I was resistant to emotion effects , because I generated them .   
Snag had hit me hard because he ’d hit me where it hurt the most .
My rage ?   
It was there , beneath the surface , but it was n’t a weak point .   
It was a regular point .
Changing course , I flew straight for the nearest rooftop .   
Sveta let go of me and dropped down the moment we were close enough .   
She was unsteady on landing , and after her legs did n’t keep her upright , she landed on her hands and knees on the roof ’s surface , which was covered in black shingle - like tiles , four feet across .   
Puddles of water settled in the parts that were lower than others , waiting to be evaporated by the sun .
I kept my mouth shut as the emotion effect subsided , and walked over to the roof ’s edge .
Love Lost had joined the chase , running alongside Nailbiter , who had extended her limbs .   
They made a racket as they ran .   
Love
Lost
’s claws scraped the road and kicked up sparks , and she was faster than an ordinary person .
Nailbiter , though , had extended her limbs , but they got narrower as they grew longer , and had become black and gnarled in the process .   
Her jaw hung low , the joints on either side extended , her jawbone    made longer and narrower , and the teeth extended further .
She looked like something half - crocodile , half - scarecrow .
She had no problem with mobility or strength , apparently , as she took strides that were fifteen feet long .
Prancer was only a short distance behind Spright .   
Spright ducked in between two parked trucks .   
As a maneuver , it put a truck between himself and Prancer , and forced Prancer to anticipate which way he ’d go , or if he ’d carry on straight and go down the alley .
Prancer hopped up onto the vehicle in the same moment that Spright slid under it .   
The two seconds it took Prancer to look around and try to find out which way he ’d gone
were seconds he could run , using enhanced speed .
He half - jumped , half - climbed up a building , with Prancer in delayed pursuit .   
Setting foot on the edge of the roof , he leaped backward , in a backward bound that saw him arcing over sidewalk , street , sidewalk , and put him on course to make contact with a building ’s face .
I started forward as Nailbiter reached out .   
Her arm extended , long , thin , and rigid , fingers doing the same as they became points so fine and far away I could n’t even make them out .   
Spright kicked out and brought an arm up to deflect the piercing fingers with the armor there .   
He landed on the roof , and an intervening building meant I could n’t see where he went from there .
I was flying in that direction when I saw Love Lost reach for her mask .   
She pulled it off , and I changed direction , reversing course and throwing myself against the roof I ’d just left .
The scream pierced through the air , raw and magnified in volume .
I could see the distortion flare up around the edge of the roof , where the effect was cut off , but it did n’t extend through the building or the roof .   
I did n’t feel the change in heart rate or breathing .
The color change and distorted blur in the environment was limited to an area in front of Love Lost ’s mouth .   
Solid objects blocked it .
I chanced a peek .   
She was down on the street , running past us ,
Nailbiter a distance ahead of her .   
She did n’t seem to have noticed me , even with her emotion power .
Damsel was chasing as well , only as fast as she could run , nothing augmented but the blasts , which she was n’t using .
Sveta , Ashley and I.    I ’d come this way because we were the worst people to deal with Love Lost .   
I ’d been ready to leap to Spright ’s defense against Nailbiter if I had to , but Love Lost being here complicated that .
At least Spright seemed to be managing , whatever he was doing .
“ Sveta , ” I said .   
“
Are you okay ?
”
“
I ’m
ok-
”
she started , and the interrupted ‘ okay’ sounded like ‘ oak’ .   
“
I ’m trying to tell my body not to murder my suit .
”
“
Can I do something ?
”
She shook her head .
“
Okay .
”
On the street , Spright had escaped Prancer .   
He returned to the main street , saw Nailbiter and Love Lost close by , and broke into a run .   
The breaker effect was steadily fading .
Prancer
’s power , I knew , was a breaker effect , to go by the PRT classifications .   
It was the most misunderstood classification in playground arguments and online debates , to the point where every power had probably been called a breaker power by someone .   
Where changers were powers that changed one ’s form and were physical and mostly bound to the natural world , breaker powers were on - off , tied into enabling powers or powersets , and were ethereal or rule - breaking .
Prancer ’s ‘ on’ switch was a power - derived form that made him fast and nimble .   
Running and jumping around made the effect steadily ramp up .   
It made him fast and evasive .
It was good to think about the mechanical side of powers , to dwell in fact and things that made me think of reading cape magazines in bed and talking to Dean .
Sveta ’s voice stirred me from my thoughts .   
“
Positive side is I just found out
I ’m all instinct when I ’m
forced into attack mode .   
My body is n’t smart enough to figure out how to get out of the suit .
”
“
Good thing , ”
I said .   
I meant it as I said it , saw the fleeting smile on her face , but I was also kind of distracted .
“
What ’s going on over there ?   
It helps if I focus on external things I ca n’t accidentally murder .
”
“ Spright ’s running , I lost track of him .   
I ’d go to him and ask what the fuck is going on , but he ’s trying to be slippery and he ’s good at it .   
I ’d talk to Prancer , but it ’s exactly the same thing .   
I do n’t want to go after Love Lost and fuck up .   
I ’m wondering if we should run , go back to the mob .
” Sveta nodded .
“ I hate to leave Spright , ” I said .   
“
He might not know about the violence , or who ’s after him , and this is a- in big fights , outright wars
, it ’s good to identify solutions .   
If I can get to Spright , I can stop this .
”
“ Love Lost is the biggest problem ?
” I nodded .
“ I think I can get her , ” Sveta said .   
She shifted position and sat back .   
“ I do n’t want to hurt her , but I think I can get her .
”
“
You sure ?
”
“ Reasonably sure .
”
“ Rule of thumb I ’ve been thinking about ?   
Seventy - five percent .   
No more than three - quarters of the hurt they ’ve done to others .   
She made ReSound bleed a lot .   
You can make her bleed a little .
” Sveta winced .
“ Or not at all , ” I said .   
“
But remember that she ’s willing to hurt Rain .   
If she had a twisted ankle or something , it ’d make a lot of things easier .
” Sveta nodded .
“
You good ?
” I asked .
“ I wanted to do this .   
Go get Spright .
”
The best way to get control over this situation .   
Spright had been sent forward as the vanguard of Advance Guard .   
Was it to lead others on a wild goose chase , or was he after something ?
I flew a course that put me directly over the rooftops , so the buildings were between me and the pairing of Nailbiter and Love Lost .   
There had been some time since the last scream .   
Her mask might have been put back on , which would have meant a delay before she could hit me with something .
That delay had been a factor when Sveta and I had both visited Cedar Point together , to deal with Sink and Hookline .   
It might be a factor here .
Prancer
’s power was n’t a threat , but it was a serious consideration .   
It made him fast and hard to track down .   
Once upon a time , it had meant he could run drugs and make drop - offs as a petty criminal .
The drawback was a concern too .   
He was forced out of the breaker state and made mundane if he got hurt .
I spotted the colorful set of blurs that was the pair , and changed course to follow .   
They were leaping between building faces , positioning feet to avoid putting one through a window , and covering as much ground up and down vertically as they were crossing horizontally .   
They were fast enough now that if they had been moving in a straight line , I would n’t have been able to keep up .
Flying over the rooftops , moving in a straight line to close the distance , I caught a glimpse of Nailbiter climbing up a two - story building with the ease someone else might climb up onto a desk .   
She moved like she was on stilts , or like she was all stilts .
Pointed ones , as I understood it .
Her arm moved , swinging .   
I heard the sound of fingers as fine as needles slicing through the air , and put my shield up .
I could n’t even see her fingers , as they crashed into me .   
Shield down , I changed course before she could close those fingers around me and set me up for something else .
Her mouth yawned open .   
My shield was n’t yet up when her teeth extended , but I was able to get down enough she would n’t hit me .   
Each tooth pointed in a slightly different direction , and she had a lot of nail - teeth .   
I heard the faint whisking sound of the thinner - than - needles teeth hitting things almost purely at random .   
Each hit with the force of a knife swung overhead and into a table .
There was a pause , and I heard an unearthly screeching sound .
The teeth had stopped just short of penetrating windows .   
With each small movement on her part , points scraped against glass .
I saw something thicker than a tooth withdrawing .   
Changing course , I maneuvered between buildings , barely a few feet above the ground , my forcefield up .
Several feet in front of me , a vague column that looked like it was more shadow than substance    lunged out into my path .
My first thought was that it was one of Sveta ’s arms .   
It was n’t .   
I tried to fly under it , since I was already so close to the ground , and the individual components fanned out to bar my way .
I crashed bodily into them , my shield absorbing the hit , and the impact made them slap against the side of a dumpster in the alleyway .   
The thing was crude in a made - just - after - the - world - ended kind of way , four pieces of thick metal , welding , and handles for the dump truck .   
The hit made one of the sides buckle , the weld at the side closest to me splitting violently .
I turned to look the other way , and saw Love Lost with one clawed hand resting on a crouching Nailbiter ’s fingers , guiding them .   
Nailbiter had both hands together , fingers pointed at me , and the fingers were extended out .
Enhanced strength , and the ability to extend any part of her body , making that part rigid and thinner .
She moved her hand , and two fingers pressed me against a wall , needle thin bars against my throat and thighs .
I could n’t trust that my forcefield would come back in time .   
My feet were only barely touching the ground , but I could fly .   
I flew away from her , sliding between the extended digits and the wall .
She increased the pressure , and I had to stop , lest I give myself road rash while scraping against the concrete wall .   
Another nail - finger shifted position , slapping me across the cheekbone and ear , and pressed my head back .
Her mouth opened .   
I did n’t see her do anything , but I threw up my shield all the same , the moment I felt it was ready .   
I pushed out , hard , and the wretch did the same , gripping and pushing the finger bars that had trapped me .   
A foot from my face , her tongue struck hard against an invisible surface .   
It would have gone right through me if it had connected .
I moved while I could , between fingers and wall .   
I could feel here and there where there was a bulge where there had been a knuckle .   
I could only imagine how it worked when it was n’t extended fingers , but the rusty nail - teeth .   
Doing this would have been like running a saw against my throat , face , and thighs .
These two were dangerous .   
I flew straight up , the moment I was free of the fingers , rounding a corner .
Instincts told me to press forward .   
I wanted to go after Spright , or remove the threat .
I stopped instead .   
There was a limit to how fast and how far they could travel .   
I had a second .
Love Lost could have hit me with a scream while I was pinned .   
She had n’t .   
She could have seen Sveta and I with her power earlier .   
The second might have been explained by her thinking we were bystanders , but the first ?
Was it that she would have been hitting Nailbiter ’s fingers ?   
Not a good idea , to provoke an enemy who was standing right next to you , not when that enemy was very good at hurting people .
An easy conclusion to jump to , but not the only one .   
I ’d been thinking about breakers , the on - off .   
It was n’t out of the question that Love Lost could only sense emotion when she was n’t projecting it .   
It could be a thing that alternated , with a period of time where she could see , a period she could project , with the mask serving to restrict it .   
It could be that her scream disabled her sight for a time after using it , while the power gobbled up energy for another activation , the sight only available when the power was primed and ready .
That attack into the alley had been timed to try and hit me , or at least to anticipate me .   
My flight pattern had n’t been predictable .   
I did n’t want to have more nail - fingers in my face the second I was up above the buildings .   
I wished I was better able to figure this out .
The scream , too .   
She made people pissed .   
Irrationally , recklessly angry .   
When she ’d done it to ReSound , she ’d been prepared for Resound lashing out .   
Maybe she had n’t done it to me because she could n’t handle me in a fight ?
Sometimes the simplest answer was the right one .
I could call Kenzie and see if they have anything to report , but that might show our hands .   
We were already showing so much .
I heard a distant scream , terrified , and it was n’t Love
Lost ’s .   
At the same moment ,    my phone vibrated in my pocket .
Pulling it out , I checked the screen .   
A text from Kenzie , now listed on my phone as ‘ Ls’ for Looksee .
Ls : 

coast clearish I flew straight up , until I had a view of the situation .   
I did n’t have a thinker power , but a view of the battlefield from above counted for something .   
If my forcefield broke , I would take evasive action .
What I saw had to be Chris .   
I was far away , so I could n’t see him well , but it had to be him .   
It was a face , six feet tall , three feet wide , with no cheeks or anything but a spine connecting the top half from the lower half , as if the chin and bottom row of teeth were the ‘ head’ of an insect , the rest of the head the thorax .   
The setup was surrounded by a ring of spider - like legs in varying shapes and sizes .   
They looked like flesh and not chitin , though , muscular meat with a pronounced ‘ elbow’ , coming to a pointed tip where it touched the ground or face .   
He jerked and twitched , large eyes wide , and some of the legs seemed to be more focused on clawing at his own face than on keeping him mobile .   
I would have said it was like someone dragging his fingernails across his cheeks , but he did n’t have any cheeks .
He screamed at them , and it was the sound of mortal terror .   
He ’d succeeded in getting Love Lost and Nailbiter
’s attention , and now huddled at the foot of a building , pulling against it as if he could pull himself through the seam between sidewalk and store .   
They did n’t seem to know what to make of him .   
I did n’t blame them .
Love Lost touched Nailbiter , and pointed in my direction .
Yeah , she could see me .   
I braced for evasive action .
Anxiety Chris screamed again , louder .   
Nailbiter moved a hand , and he darted to one side , taking a wild path that saw him running up the wall and off the side of the building , radically changing direction as he touched ground .
He was quick .   
I was put in mind of a bug darting to the darkness as the lights came on .
They were caught between keeping an eye on me and keeping an eye on Chris .
When Love Lost touched her mask , Chris sped another fifteen feet in a heartbeat .
She pulled off the mask , and she screamed at him .   
I could see the distortion , aimed more at the ground now .   
Roughly conical , it covered a lot of area .
Chris twitched , jerked , moved this way , then that .   
He raised his fleshy spider legs and pointed two tips at them , and Love Lost moved slightly behind Nailbiter , as if she ’d find cover behind the exceedingly thin limbs .
Chris screamed back , raw and scared .
There was a moment ’s pause , and she screamed at him again .   
Compounding the effect ?
He screamed at her again , quivering in the wake of it , and crept closer .
Nailbiter ’s fingers stabbed the ground between herself and him .
He screamed , brief , and ran away .   
It seemed he could n’t move in a straight line , or the evasive action was built in , because he traced an ‘ s’ shape as he ran .
I flew to put buildings between me and her .   
Where were Spright and Prancer now ?   
We ’d diverted the dangerous elements , but I wanted to fix things .   
I wanted to take concrete , measured steps to make things better , now that Advance Guard had shit the bed as badly as they had .
I wanted the world to make sense again .   
And Cedar Point did n’t make sense .
Two more screams , both in short succession .   
Anxiety Chris’ scream .   
I turned to look , and I saw the faint shadow of Nailbiter ’s nail - fingers stabbing skyward .
Love Lost was running up the fingers .   
They were thin , but she did n’t seem to be struggling .
Her mask was off , and she was looking down .   
Looking for me .
Scratch my earlier theory about her not wanting to provoke me .
I could n’t get to cover fast enough , so I did the opposite .   
I headed straight for her .   
If she thought she could deal with me , I wanted to see what she ’d do .   
I pushed out with my aura for the first time , to make it harder .
She would be resistant , like Snag was .   
Still , I refused to believe that she could deal with my aura , scream , at me , and take evasive action against my charge while thirty feet above the rooftops .
Nailbiter lashed out .   
Teeth .   
My forcefield took the hit , and I carried forward .   
Love Lost lost her footing , teetering , then leaped hard off of the fingers .
I flew straight down , to put myself out of Nailbiter ’s reach , while Love Lost leaped sideways .
She touched the side of Prancer ’s headquarters , the claws of her hands and feet finding traction on the surface , and she moved like she was running , claws catching and helping to propel her .
There was the wall - running power .   
She moved fluidly along a vertical surface , claws helping .   
Her hand went to her mask , and a hand reached up from below , grabbing her ankle .
Sveta .
Love Lost was pulled away from the building .   
No longer able to make contact with the surface , she fell at a diagonal , in the direction of the rooftop she ’d originally been falling down to .   
I could see her reorient herself in the air , twisting to put feet beneath her , but she could n’t stop falling .
Not a terminal fall , most likely , but it ’d be a hard one .
In the distance , I could hear Chris screaming as he ran .   
He covered a lot of ground , apparently , because the scream faded with each passing second .
Good job , Sveta , I thought .   
Not showing her hand , catching Love
Lost by surprise , and staying clear of that scream were perfect .   
It had taken her a while , but I did n’t blame her for moving carefully and having trouble finding the right position and moment to act .
No , that was exactly what I was wanting to do .   
It was energizing , in a way , exciting .   
For all my doubts , I liked that at least one person was on my wavelength .
Chris had done his thing too .   
Not bad , but he ’d shown himself to Nailbiter , and it worried me that he could have been stabbed if Nailbiter had been a little more willing to pull the trigger and impale him .
I flew in Sveta ’s direction , and found her waiting , her back to the wall , phone out .
She jumped when I floated over to her .
“
Good , ” I said .   
“
I ’ll tell you how good after .
” She smiled .   
She showed me the phone .
Ls : 

prance lost sprite .   
sprite on roof to W of u 

we here at edge of town .   
mob splitting up .   
some headed ur way As I read the messages , a new alert popped up .
Ls : 

nail dam comin
I grabbed Sveta ’s hand , and prepared to fly away when Damsel appeared in the alleyway .   
I could have called her Ashley , but she did n’t give me the impression of ‘ Ashley’ .   
Shadows fell across her face , accented by the mask and makeup , her eyes were eerily white , her hair was white , and it made for an attention - grabbing profile .   
If I had n’t known better , I might have been intimidated .
Nailbiter appeared , looming over Damsel in a crouch , three times as tall as Damsel was , so thin in places as to be almost invisible .   
Her face was still prolonged , jaw hanging , teeth pronounced .
Love Lost was in Nailbiter
’s cupped hand , crouching , holding one finger for balance .   
I could n’t tell how hurt she was .
“ I ’ll deign to let you two help me against the wannabe Alexandria and the girl with the paint , ” Damsel said , dismissive .
Nailbiter pulled her face back together , the features drawing shorter .   
“
You are n’t Cedar Point .
”
There was a whistling ‘ s’ sound on Cedar .
“ I am now , ” Damsel said .   
“
Mess this bad ?   
Ripe for takeover .
”
“
We can discuss that , ” Nailbiter said .
“ Interested ? ”
Damsel asked .
“
You ’re being hasty , ”
Nailbiter said .   
“
I ’d be interested if I was n’t loyal to Bob .
”
Love
Lost swiped out with a claw , dashing claw - tips against the wall to her left .   
It made a sound , and both Damsel and Nailbiter focused their attention on her .
She pointed at us .
“
Yes , ” Nailbiter said .
She started forward , with sufficient clearance to go over Damsel , and I flew with Sveta ’s hand firmly in my grip .   
I could hear Damsel used her power in the same instant , lunging forward .
It bought us time , that she hurled herself forward while Nailbiter was trying to place an extended limb .
Time to get around a corner , to take pre - emptive evasive action .
They turned the same corner , and Sveta had turned herself around .   
She cast her hand out , and gripped Love Lost at the neck and hair .   
Love Lost had her hand at her mask , and stopped , not screaming .
“
Sorry !
”
Sveta called out , as she hauled Love
Lost free of Nailbiter ’s grip , pulling her halfway toward us before letting go .
Love Lost was like a cat , apparently , acrobatic enough to keep her claws under her .   
Still , she was moving fast , momentum was a thing , and the resulting landing was a bit of a roll and tumble , before she managed to stop herself .
Scraped up and glaring , Love Lost watched as I put some vertical distance between us .   
Nailbiter slowed to avoid trampling Love Lost , falling behind slightly , and then raised a hand , aiming .
Reflexively , I brought up my forcefield and heaved Sveta up , back and away .   
Instinct .   
I could n’t have my forcefield up while holding her .
I could n’t even watch to see what Sveta did .   
My focus was on Nailbiter .
She chose to try to get Sveta while Sveta was in the air .   
I saw the mass of teeth extending , spearing out , and they were aimed too low to be aimed at me .
I flew down to intercept .   
Forcefield up , I grabbed them after they had extended past me , pushing down , redirecting .   
The wretch had to have grabbed them too , because she moved like superstrength applied .   
All of the teeth were attached to her and when I moved some of them , I moved them all .
That done , I looked back for Sveta .   
The inverse of Love Lost , to tumble so bonelessly through the air , with no ability to reorient herself .
My forcefield scraped against the nails as I flew past them , pushing them more before a last - second course correction to intercept Sveta .   
I caught her .
“
Warn me !
” I nodded .   
It was very possible
I felt more alarmed in the wake of the moment than Sveta did , and she looked really alarmed .
I looked back .   
Love Lost and Nailbiter were on the ground , and Nailbiter was n’t pressing the attack .
“
You going to explain that ?
” Sveta asked .
“ I can , ” I said .   
“ Sorry .
”
“
It ’s okay , but-
what was that analogy ?   
Wolf , corn , chicken ?
”
“ Wolf , ” I said .   
I had an ugly , heavy feeling that thoroughly crushed the moment of triumph .   
I flew down , setting foot on the rooftop .   
Each passing second , it bothered me more .   
“ Wolf .
”
“ I do n’t follow .   
I did n’t follow the analogy in the first place , but- secrets ?   
Maneuvers ?
”
“ Just … wolf , ” I said .   
I did n’t want to explain it in detail .   
“ Control issue .   
Similar to yours .
”
I saw her forehead crease above her mask .
“ You did n’t have one before .
”
“
No I did n’t , ” I said .
“
Okay , ” she said .   
“
You should have told me .
” I tried to formulate a response .   
She would n’t look directly at me .
As I opened my mouth , she looked down at her phone , as if she was looking for an excuse to look away .   
The tiny change in her expression gave me pause .
“
What is it ?
”
“
Come , Spright ’s moving .
”
She grabbed my arm , tugging .
“
You can carry me ?
” she asked .
I nodded , seizing her with a firmer grip than necessary , carrying her off the roof .
Spright still had a vestige of Prancer ’s power , even though Prancer was nowhere nearby .   
I could see him running along a rooftop .   
He leaped from the rooftop ’s edge , to the building face next door .
The building was Prancer ’s headquarters .   
A stone building with a clocktower on the top .
Touching fingertips to toes , as his feet pointed straight forward , Spright passed through an open window and landed at a run .   
For Sveta and I , we had to get there first , and then we had to maneuver ourselves through the window .   
I supported Sveta so she could climb through and then looked around to make sure we were n’t being observed .
Well , if the clairvoyants were awake , and they had to be with the day still young , Chris still screaming in the distant background , and various other noises and chaos , then we were being observed .
But I could n’t see anyone who could follow us into the building .
The things inside were … not especially nice , even though attempts had been made .   
It made me think more of a parent teacher conference room and
my mom ’s office when she was really deep in work .   
Budget desk , budget chairs , budget stuff in general , with the doors being wood that had n’t even been polished down that nicely before being painted , and some signs of domesticity , with a jacket on the back of a chair , signs of eating at desks , and personal touches littering the space .
Spright was already across the floor .   
A binder was open in front of him .
“ Spright , ” I said .
“
The heroine who was Glory Girl , and a friend , ” he said , sounding pleasant , even casual .   
He picked up the binder and turned our way .   
“
I heard you were around .
”
I stalked toward him , reaching for the top of the chest - plate that served as the closest thing I ’d get to a collar .   
He scrambled back , staying just out of reach , turning to flight when his feet failed him .   
He dropped the binder .
Failing to get a grip on him so I could shake sense into the man , I settled for pointing a finger accusatorily at him .
I could hear Chris screaming in the background , a distant sound I could n’t place , that might have been a giant tinker device going off .
This entire thing had been about taking a topsy - turvy world and making it topsy - turvy for the bad guys , unseating them and breaking their hold .   
It had been about sanity , and they ’d pulled the most insane fucking stunt , and they ’d upended it .
But I could n’t burn bridges .   
They were … how would Ashley have put it ?   
Blithering idiots ?   
And I had to get along with them .   
Heroes needed to cooperate , the team needed it , and I wanted to be diplomatic .








“ You ’re pissed , ” Spright replied .
“
Why ?
” I asked , again , stabbing my finger in his direction .   
He stepped back out of the way of it .   
“
What the hell is Advance Guard doing ?
”
“
This is how we operate , ” Spright said .   
He put the binder he was holding down , moving a few things to look at the things on the table .   
Having verified something or verified the lack of something , he gave Sveta and I his full attention .   
“
We identify targets in need and we handle them .   
We ’re good at it .
”
“ What about jurisdictions ?
”
I asked .
Spright paused .   
One finger tapped the desk .   
“
This is Foresight
’s .   
They got this territory when we held a lottery for the major areas of the city .
”
“
Did you talk to Foresight ?
” Sveta asked .   
Her tone was a marked contrast to mine .   
It sounded pitying or pleading .   
Spright had already pointed out how I sounded .
“
You think this is your territory ,
” Spright voiced his realization aloud .
“
Did you talk to Foresight ?
” I repeated Sveta ’s question in my own way .
“
Not me personally , ” Spright said .   
“
Okay .   
We need to talk this out , but now is n’t the time .   
Let me do my thing ,
two to five minute investigation , then if you wanted to let me copy some of your powers to make a graceful exit , I ’d appreciate it .   
Then we have a conversation .
”
He put one hand on the binder .   
I put my hand down on the corner of the binder , and slid it away from him .
“ ReSound got sliced up , ” I said .
I could see Spright tense .   
“
How sliced up ?
”
“
Enough that I ’m
mentioning it , ” I said .   
“
And enough that we need you to go straight back to your team and tell them to leave .   
Then we can have a chat .
”
“ Okay , ” Spright said .   
He walked around the table , putting it between us .   
“
I hear what you ’re saying .
”
“
Time is of the essence here , ” I said .   
The change in position worried me .   
Was he going to bolt ?   
Or anticipating violence from me ?
I changed my stance , forcing myself to relax my posture .
“
This is n’t the first time we ’ve raided enemy territory or the first time someone was hurt .   
We have a pattern we operate by .   
I handle my part
and I trust the others to handle theirs .
”
“ And Cedar Point ?
” I asked .
“ Will be better off in the long run , ” Spright said .
“
Capes are n’t liked right now , ” Sveta said .   
“
The local villains have been pressuring people here who ca n’t afford to leave , which makes feelings toward capes even lower .   
We were doing something here .   
You ca n’t just …
”
The pity or pleading in her voice gave way to frustration at that last part , to the point she could n’t finish her own sentence .
“ …
Create a mess and trust they ’ll be better off , ” I said .
“
Yes .   
Exactly , thank you , ” Sveta said .
“ Others have been coming-
” “ Were invited to come , ” I said .   
“ Screened , to avoid a screwy situation .
”
“ We were invited too !
”
Spright said .
There .   
Now the situation made some sense .   
Advance Guard had been invited .   
It was n’t by us .   
Someone looking to screw us up or throw a wrench into the works .
Sveta and I exchanged glances .
“
What ? ”
Spright asked .
“ You may have been played , ” I said .   
I had to keep in mind that the clairvoyants could be watching .   
“
Maybe you should walk us through your side of the story .
”
“
Any minute now , people could come after me .   
They ’ll figure out we ’re in here , ” Spright said .
“
Fast version , ” I said .
He moved , taking two quick steps to one side , before slapping his hand down on the table .   
“
It would n’t be out of the question for you to be working with the bad guys .   
Stalling me , throwing a wrench into our plan .   
It ’d even be a good cover , for a team like Prancer ’s B - listers to try to corner or confuse the hero jurisdiction too .
”
“ Completely out of the question , ” I said .
“
Not a moment ’s hesitation ?
” he asked .   
“
No outrage or indignation ?
”
“
It makes sense for you to say it .   
But not if you do any digging .   
I ’m a cape from a cape family .   
Every surviving relative I have is a hero or ex - hero .   
If I pulled something like that , I ’d get caught and I ’d lose my entire family and their respect .
”
“
I ’m dating and living with Weld from the Wardens , ” Sveta said .   
“
He ’d lose everything , and I would n’t do that to him .
”
Spright ’s head turned .   
He analyzed Sveta , then me , peering through the lens of his future - elfin mask .   
“
Straight to talking about your relationship to other people .   
Nothing about yourselves .   
Good cops have crooked cop kids and girlfriends .
”
“
References and connections matter , ” I said .   
“
I could say any number of things about myself , but that ’s my words out of my mouth .   
Talk to my dad ?   
My cousin ?   
They ’ll give you a clearer picture of who I am .
”
“ I remember her .   
I ’ve talked to Weld , ” Spright said .
“
And ?
”
“
Fuck , ”
Spright said .   
“ Alright .   
Fast version ?   
We caught wind of what was going on here when someone was commenting on the stupid cape names here .   
We asked around .   
Teams building bonds , taking turns to help out in a place that needed help .
”
“ People talked about stuff that they needed to keep their mouths shut about , ” I said .
“
They did n’t talk , ” Spright said .   
“ Not as far as I know .   
But secrets are hard to keep when powers are in play .   
They did n’t talk Cedar Point , but they were psyched about working together on a level outside of what the Wardens are negotiating .   
On a lower level , I mean .   
We have the meetings at the Wardens headquarters , and people were stopping in at the same place .
”
“
And you asked Foresight ?
”
“ Not me .   
Mayday .   
He said we were clear to go .
”
Who the hell had Kenzie ’s old boss talked to , that we were n’t roped in ?
“ Foresight is tied up with war stuff right now , ” Sveta said .
“ They are , ” he said .
“
Is it possible the key people were tied up , and Mayday talked to lower - level members of Foresight ?
” Sveta asked .
“ I do n’t know , ” he replied .
“ Hold the questions along those lines , ” I said .   
“
Good theory , Sveta , but we should get the particulars later .   
Time ’s short .
”
“
Okay .   
I ’ll check the window , ” Sveta said .
Time was short , and the clairvoyants were possibly listening in .   
There was a degree to which I did n’t want to reveal too much to them , at the same time I wanted to get the situation straight .
Was it a play , then ?   
Or was it bad circumstance ?
Hard to know without talking to Mayday .
“
Our version ?
” I asked .   
“
We ’ve been juggling multiple teams , trying to keep on the down low , and we ’re holding the fort until a team decides to settle in permanently .
”
“ You , specifically , ” he said .
“
Us , as a group .   
We ’re setting up as a team , ” I said .   
I thought of the clairvoyants .   
“ We ’re getting ourselves set up , we ’re still getting costumes and names , headquarters , and a long - term plan .   
This is an interim job , and it gets us some money , connections , and favor .
”
“
And you think we bypassed that ?
”
“
You bypassed it .   
The team is getting paid by people who want a chance to get some practice in and mess with the Cedar Point guys while they ’re bewildered .   
We ’re getting resources .   
We ’re draining their resources .   
They ’re spending money to hire help , they ’re losing people .   
They pull favors from major players , get answers or other stuff .   
What I arranged , my part in this , is that one of those players gives us a cut each time we provoke these guys to call .   
It drains the bad guys and I can give these guys their startup cash .
”
Sveta was walking around the perimeter of the office .   
She stopped and looked my way .   
“
You ’re telling him ?
”
I ’m
telling Cedar Point .   
They want answers , and I ’m going to give them Tattletale .
I had n’t wanted to do it so soon , but it was something in keeping with my warrior monk philosophy .   
My goal here was stability .   
To minimize the ripple effects and keep things from pinging off of one another to cause a greater disaster .   
I wanted things to stop .
“
Yeah , I ’m telling him , ” I said .
I could see Spright consider it .
If this madness continued without a scapegoat or a target , then it would only continue unabated , with endless escalation .   
So long as Cedar Point thought they knew what was going on , they would move predictably , rather than windmilling their arms around and stirring up chaos .
“
You were just talking to me about how the company we keep and our references matter .   
You ’re working with the villains ?
”
“ Working with heroes .   
Accepting the big picture villains are a part of the picture we ’re not going to be able to shake , and adapting to that .   
Trust me when I say I do not have any fond feelings for who I ’m talking to .   
If you knew the name and did some digging into my background , you ’d know that .
”
He reached down to the table and fidgeted with a carving , the shape only partially blocked out .   
Wood shavings surrounded it .
He did n’t give a response , seemingly considering .
“ Spright , ” I said , dead serious .
“ I do n’t like the way you ’re doing this , ” he said .
“ I like you , Spright .   
I liked our talk before everything went to shit , when we first met .   
But the feeling is mutual .   
I do n’t like how you guys are doing this either .
”
I watched as he nodded slowly .
“ We were here first , ” I said .   
“ I ’d really like to cooperate with you guys like we ’re cooperating with other heroes .   
But either someone ’s messing with us by giving you a false go - ahead , or you guys fucked up somewhere .   
Whichever it is , you ca n’t be here .
”
“ Or Foresight fucked up , ” he said .
“ Or
that , ” I said .   
I did n’t believe it .   
I repeated myself with more emphasis , “ Whichever it is , you ca n’t be here .   
If you were supposed to be here , it would n’t be a surprise to us .
”
He flicked the wooden figurine across the table .   
“
Damn it .
”
“
Go talk to your people , convince them to quit this , ” I said .
“ I will , ” he said .   
“
Can I use your powers ?
”
“ You do n’t want to use mine , ” Sveta said .   
“
If you even can .
”
“
You sure ?
” he asked .   
“
I get an intuitive sense of movement - related powers .   
Yours seems okay .   
Coded weird , but I can push past that .
”
“
Mine ’s dangerous , ” she said .
“
Yeah , ” I said , “ Be careful .
”
“
I ’m terrible at careful , ” he said .   
He turned to me .   
“ Flight .   
And … shadows of feet and fingers groping for handholds ?   
I do n’t think that one would move me very far .   
Only by inches .
”
It was the most direct reference to the Wretch
I ’d heard someone make .   
I wanted to reply , to look normal , and I could n’t .
My heart pounded more with the one question and two follow - up sentences than it had with all of my irritation and anger at Advance Guard .
“
Can you use only the flight ?
” I managed .
“
Yes .   
Absolutely , ” he said .   
His feet left the ground .   
“
Cover me ?   
We ’ll take the direct route .
”
I followed , meeting Sveta before we reached the window .   
As Spright passed through the open window , I saw the look my friend gave me .   
I saw it again as I passed through the window , turned around , and put my arm around her waist as she made it through the window in a more than slightly awkward way , prosthetic body not cooperating fully .
My arm around her waist , her arm around my shoulder , we flew after Spright .
Airborne , a ways ahead of us , Spright put his arms out to his sides .   
Ribbons extended out from his wrists , loose in the air , one from each wrist .
I gave him a wide berth as I realized what they were supposed to be .
He gave us a sly look over one shoulder , then reached out .   
The ribbon moved faster than the eye could follow , reaching for a ventilation duct on a roof .   
He pulled himself to it , in a very familiar way , reached out with the other , and through a combination of flight and use of the two ribbons , sped well ahead of us .
I realized what it was I was seeing .
“
I ’m
kind of not a fan of these guys , ” I said .
“ I kind of get what you mean , ” she said .   
With the wind in my ears , I looked at her to track what she was saying better .   
The look on her face broke my heart a little .   
It was a longing look , where she did n’t take her eyes off of Spright and his casual use of her power until he was out of sight .
A trash can was knocked down here , the contents blown around by wind .   
A section of roads had cracks in it that I was pretty sure were n’t from the road settling .
In the distance , I heard Love Lost ’s scream .   
The mob .   
She and Nailbiter had returned to the scene , it seemed .
I reached for my phone , and I hit the button .
“
It ’s me .   
Update ?
”
“ I can talk ?   
Are you there ?   
Did you leave ?
”   
Kenzie .   
Looksee .
“
I do n’t think they ’re listening in on phones , no ,
” I said .   
“ Codenames only , to be safe .
”
“ Codenames .   
It ’s Looksee here with Capricorn .   
He ’s on the phone .   
I lost track of who with .   
I ’m at the perimeter .   
Are we good to go ?
”
“
Not yet , ” I said .   
“
Hand me over to Capricorn as soon as he ’s free ?
”
“ Can do .
”
Closer to the scene where the fighting had initially broken out , things were more chaotic .   
I stopped at a rooftop to try to get a sense of it all .
Eight members of the twelve initial Advance Guard capes were present .   
Spright was near someone I presumed was Mayday , a guy who wore a costume with red and black armor panels and a cape that covered one shoulder .
“ Handholds and footholds ?
”
Sveta asked , quiet .
I pressed the phone against my chest , to muffle it .   
“
Yeah .   
I guess .
”
“
That ’s the wolf ?   
I saw the expression on your face .
”
In the midst of the fight , Advance Guard was actually faring well enough , even though I could n’t tell where four of their members were .   
Spright was having a conversation with Mayday , as villains approached them , crowding in .   
Mayday raised a hand , palm flat , then brought it down , so it pointed forward .   
Villains started scrambling out of the way .
From the distance , a flare of red light rose against the blue sky at the horizon , framed with something shadowy and dark that made it stand out clearly .
It was deceptive , in its general oblong shape , which became a circle and became oblong again , and its apparent lack of depth .
I realized what it was and put my hand at Sveta ’s arm , in case I needed to pull her away .   
A projectile of some sort .   
It soared toward us , and touched down in the middle of the battlefield , with Mayday running to intercept it , getting clipped by one of Nailbiter
’s claws on the way .
It hit him , almost dead on , and smashed into the road like water might , a mess of red strands that glowed to the point they were almost neon , in a sea of darker and darker strands .   
The webbed ball dissipated , broke up , the lines spreading out to run through , around , over and under almost everything on the ground .   
The larger portion of the mass skidded nearly a hundred feet before breaking up .   
Mayday ’s team had been carried along with the skid , and as the strands dissipated , they were on their feet , standing in formation .   
The villains who had n’t scrambled out of the way were at the edges , lying down , or pushed between parked cars .   
No property damage had been done .
They were outnumbered two to one , but Advance Guard was n’t losing .   
They looked battered .   
Two of them were being locked down by one of their fellow teammates .   
Affected by Love
Lost
’s scream , it seemed .
The phone ’s speaker buzzed against my chest .   
I picked it up .
“
The bad guys have reinforcements coming , ” Looksee reported .   
“ From your five .   
I think that ’s how it works , right ?   
Five is behind and to your right ?   
Or is twelve o’clock directly behind ?
”
“
That ’s how it works , Looksee , ” I said .   
“
Five is right .   
We ’ll keep an eye out .
”
I looked back over my shoulder .   
Did I want to get involved in the brawl like this ?
“ Victoria ?
” Sveta asked .
Down on the road , Advance Guard were using an area that had become a bit of a bottleneck , with one section of sidewalk fenced off with railings that had been bolted down , so there could be a patio outside one restaurant , and several cars were parked beyond that fence and on the opposite side of the street .   
Mayday retreated through the bottleneck with a flying ally shielding him by catching some flung balls of flame in what looked like a web of glowing lines in geometric shapes .   
Mayday raised both hands , palms flat , forming a ‘ y’ , and then brought them down .
In the distance well behind him , twin flares of red energy appeared at the horizon .   
One of them might have been headed straight for me .
I fixed my grip on Sveta ’s arm , then carried her skyward .
Up , away , clear of the immediate fight , until the figures on the battlefield were specks .   
I stopped there , at a height
I was pretty sure the clairvoyants could n’t track me , where the phone I held still had two bars of signal .
Comfortably away , secure , and private .   
Close enough to see if the reinforcements appeared .
“ Scary , being up this high , ” Sveta said .   
“
Scarier that you are n’t answering my question .
”
“
Sorry , ” I said .
“ Do n’t be sorry .   
Answer me .
” I nodded .   
The sick feeling that had hit me when Spright had commented on the wretch ’s existence had n’t gone away .   
It was worse , if anything .
Mayday ’s power hit .   
Two shots , barreling in from the horizon in a matter of seconds , each half the size of a house .   
The red balls were more oblong than before , where the last one had only appeared that way because of its arc .   
The shape might have been why they traveled further as they hit , carrying people away .   
While villains scrambled to get to their feet .   
Lines spread out , forming overlapping triangles , circles , squares , and stars , extending in a pattern around the woman who had been shielding Mayday .
I pressed the phone down against my chest .
“
You ’re being weird , ” Sveta said .   
“ And weird can be allowed , believe me-
”
She let out a small , hollow laugh .
“
-But
bad weird is n’t .   
You ’re not just pulling away .   
You ’re pushing away .   
Throwing me away , literally .
”
“
That ’s not-
”
“ You threw me aside , Victoria .   
Literally .   
You did n’t warn me .
”
“
I would n’t throw you if I could n’t catch you ,
okay ?
” I asked .   
I wanted to put my thoughts into words without blurting them out , but I could n’t do that while defending myself and simultaneously making sure I did n’t leave the heroes down below undefended .
“
It ’s not
okay , ” Sveta said .   
“
I feel shitty for bringing this up now , but it ’s really not okay that I barely recognize you sometimes , and it just got shoved in my face twice .
”
“ I do n’t want you to recognize me .
”
“
Not that .   
Not- mostly not that .   
Not-
I ’m glad you ’re you again .   
I ’m glad I can communicate with you without you bringing every conversation back to the topic of your sister .
” I flinched .   
I did n’t blurt , but I did voice something safe and reliable , something I ’d already said , because it was safer than   that .
“
It ’s the wolf .
”
“ That does n’t tell me anything .   
Spright told me more than that .   
I really , really do n’t want to find out stuff from other people instead of you , Victoria .
”
“ It’s- My forcefield moves with a mind of its own , ” I said .
She did n’t retort , and it was my instinct that I ’d hear her retort .   
That was n’t based on her , not on the time we ’d spent together at the hospital , where we ’d kept each other company , communicated , shared a computer and tried to keep each other sane .   
It was based on what I ’d want to do .   
She ’d been pressing me , attacking , aggressive .   
Were it my old self , without the two - year long reality check , I would n’t have been able to just stop after being on that verbal offensive .   
I would have pressed .
She did n’t .
“
Since the hospital , ” I said , for elaboration .
“ Moves on its own ?   
Does it make you move ?
” she asked .
I shook my head .
“
But it fits your body .
”
“
Not anymore , ” I said .   
“ Not this body .
”
I did n’t elaborate , because I did n’t have it in me .   
I waited , let her put it together .   
I saw her expression change , and I focused instead on Advance Guard against Hollow Point down below .
We were higher up than a ten story building would be .
“
Sorry , ” I said .   
“
Having this conversation with you when you ca n’t storm off or walk away .
”
“ Do n’t drop me , ” she said .
I nodded , stiff .
She shifted her grip , extending an arm to reach for my shoulder .   
Her prosthetic foot tapped against mine , then her toe settled on top of it .   
I held my foot rigid while she pushed herself up a bit , pulling on my shoulders until she ’d raised up .
It took some doing , and it took me realizing and helping her a bit , but she found a position where she could wrap her arms around me in a hug .
My eyes remained on the scene below as I hugged her back with one hand .   
My other hand still held the phone against my chest , and Sveta ’s hard chest pressed hard against the back of my hand .   
It hurt and I did n’t make her stop .
I wanted to hug tight , but the pain reminded me it did n’t matter , because it was only her shell .
“
Thank you , ” I said , instead .   
“ Thank you , thank you .
”
“ Idiot , moron .   
Tell me .
”
“ I have n’t even told Mrs. Yamada .
”
“ Lamebrain .   
You do n’t think I one hundred percent get it ?   
You do n’t think this stuff makes sense to me ?   
More than anything or everything else ?
”
“
Maybe I did n’t want it to be got , ” I said .
She moved her head , knocking it against mine .   
She did it again .
It made me think of the hospital .   
Of a time shortly before she ’d left with Weld .   
A couple of weeks before , maybe .   
Physiotherapy , working on my manual dexterity , they ’d given us video games and controls we could use .   
Sveta had done a lot of it , and picked up more of it for the social aspect , so she ’d joined me to egg me on .
She ’d done the head - knock out of frustration then too .   
I ’d been so focused on trying to get movement out of my hands and translate that to the controls that I had n’t been paying much attention to the game .
It was a bittersweet memory , which was about as good as things had gotten , then .   
Two or so weeks later , Weld had gone to see her .   
I could remember her anticipation leading up to the meeting .   
She ’d been so upset over the Case fifty - threes defecting en - masse from the Protectorate and Wards , and Weld ’s visit had turned that around .
It had n’t gone well .   
I was n’t sure exactly what had happened .   
Then Weld had come to see me .   
He ’d treated me with more human decency than I ’d had out of anyone but my therapists , patient advocate , or the other patients for months .   
He ’d been patient , ignored my ramblings , he ’d been gentle , asked what he could do for me .   
It could n’t have been easy .   
I ’d been a mess .
I ’d convinced him to go back to her , with a renewed perspective .   
Later on , I ’d given them my blessings .   
She ’d walked away from the hospital with her hero and freedom .   
Weld had gotten my only real friend and one of my only unabashed , unpaid - for allies .
I drew in a deep breath and sighed .
Sveta spoke first .   
“
There was a time I was with a team .   
Things came to a head , a climax .   
It turned out half of the team had one idea of what we wanted , and the other half had another .   
Blood was shed .   
People died .   
Really- really cool people .   
The deaths were n’t as bad as the betrayals .   
I do n’t want this to be a repeat of that .
”
“
Neither do I. ”
“
So I want to ask , because I did n’t ask then .   
What the hell are we doing ?
” Sveta asked .
“
Hugging .   
Trying to keep this situation from getting too out of control .
”
Whatever reinforcements Kenzie had mentioned had n’t caught up with us yet .   
The battle lines were separating , now .   
Advance Guard was now a group of seven people .   
I was n’t sure where the eighth had gone .   
Spright was at Mayday ’s side , talking in short sentences .   
Here and there , enemies lashed out .
“
Those things are now , ” Sveta said .
“ I think … we know what it is to be powerless , and to be stuck like that , and not always having people able or willing to help .   
Just about every member of the team does .
”
“
Yeah .
”
“ We ’ll help those people .   
Cedar Point is a group of those people .
”
“ Colt .
”
“ Colt included , ” I said .
“
Can we get in there ?
”   
Sveta asked .
I hesitated .
“
This is our jurisdiction .
”
I put the phone to my ear .   
“ Looksee ?
”
“ Heyo .
”
“
Where are those reinforcements ?
”
“
Fighting in the ranks .   
They ’re gathering themselves together .   
Eight more .
”
“
Okay .   
Is Capricorn there ?
”
“
He ’s on the phone .   
Talking to Foresight now .
”
“ I want to move now .   
Before this ends one way or the other .   
Have him hang up and give him the phone .   
We make an appearance .
”
I pulled the phone away from my ear at the enthusiastic noise she made .
“
I ’m here ,
” Capricorn said , on the other line .   
“
I spent five minutes on the phone with Natalie before giving up .
”
Giving up ?   
I remembered trying to convey the situation with Hookline and Kitchen Sink , before having to resort to video evidence .   
Maybe we ’d need to get her access to Kenzie ’s feed .
“
I was talking to Foresight , they do n’t know what ’s going on with Advance Guard , ” he added .
“
Neither does Advance Guard , apparently .   
It ’s time .   
We should act before things get worse .
”
“
Ok .   
On our way .   
E.T.A. five minutes .
”
Sveta shifted her grip on me at the same moment I flew straight toward the ground .   
Her hand slipped from my shoulder , and I caught her .
Fucking Advance Guard , fucking Prancer ’s people , fucking wretch , hospital , mom , Amy .
It could n’t be easy .
The thoughts flew through my mind and I left them behind as I plunged .   
I slowed and stopped as we reached the ground , still landing hard enough my legs bent , and I nearly dropped to one knee .
I ’d put us right in the middle of Advance Guard
’s group .
“ They ’re friendly !
”
Spright called out .
“
You sure about that ?
”
Shortcut asked .   
He was on the periphery , holding his polearm .
“
Pretty sure , ” Spright said .
On the other side of the bottleneck were sixteen villains with a scattered few mooks .   
Mooks augmented with Bitter Pill ’s tinker stuff , it looked like .   
Foaming at the mouths , in a way .
Snag was there , in the back .   
Love Lost had retreated as well .
No , there was more to it .   
There was a division in the enemy ranks .   
Prancer , Moose , Velvet , Etna , and someone who might have been a thinker , in one group .   
They moved and talked to one another like they were cooperating .   
There was a faint red fog around them , heavier at the ground , at ankle height .
Bitter Pill
’s group had Bluestocking , the six mooks , Crested , Birdbrain , and Foggy Idea .   
That group was more visually distinct , all but the mooks being tidier , and they hung back .   
The mark between them and Prancer ’s group was subtle .   
They were at the edge of the fog , and they held themselves differently .   
Crested with his fan and Birdbrain with a bullwhip were the only ones with weapons .
Compared to that subtle distinction between Pill ’s group and Prancer ’s , the Nailbiter , Love Lost , Snag , Damsel , and a couple of the more violent and dangerous looking ones , like Sidepiece and Disjoint , were standing such that there was a fifteen foot gap between them and the others .
Anxiety Chris was in the distant background , perhaps a block away , screaming .   
His change would be fading soon , I imagined .
Eighteen of them .
Seven Advance Guard , Sveta and I , with Capricorn and Looksee on the way .
Love Lost screamed , and the diagram - drawer blocked it .   
Nobody caught at the edges .   
I imagined it helped the group had shrunk to seven .
“
I ca n’t convince you guys to up and leave ?
” I asked .
“
Our teleporter is pulling one at a time , ” Mayday said .   
“
She ’d pull us all at once , but the impression got scrambled when the scream hit our thinker .
”
Sidepiece and Disjoint were moving to flank the group , sneaking around a parked vehicle .   
A diagram - wall appeared to block them off .   
Disjoint hopped up onto the vehicle and was knocked off as Mayday swung a hand in his direction , casting out a tiny version of the red projectile he ’d been bringing in from the horizon .   
As Disjoint landed at her feet , Damsel started cussing him out for getting in her way .
“
It ’s going to take a bit , ” Mayday said .   
“ Gets harder as our group shrinks .   
Injured go out first , then the less mobile .
”
“ They have reinforcements incoming , ” I said .   
“ Infighting is slowing them down , but the enemy group is going to get larger while yours gets smaller .
”
“ We know this , ” Mayday said .   
He had a deep , rich voice , which was muffled slightly by his mask .   
“
The thinker I mentioned , Mapwright , showed us before evacuating out .
”
“ They have more strong capes than we were led to believe , ” the diagram - woman said .
“ We need to talk about who you talked to , ”
I replied , under my breath .
The good guys were stuck , in a way .   
Powers aside , the vehicles and nearby railing were the only things that kept the Hollow Point villains from charging in all at once .   
It was n’t that they were that great an obstruction to a group of people like Nailbiter , Moose , or Prancer .   
It was that they made it so that for people to pass that point , they needed to approach in ones and twos .
“
We need to talk , Prancer !
”
I called out .
He did n’t answer , verbally or otherwise .   
There was a dark look on his face , and it was the violent clique that grew louder .   
Not Snag , not Love Lost , but Nailbiter and her fellows .   
Damsel did n’t jeer , but she said something , and one of the villains smirked .
“
Let ’s call a ceasefire !
”
I raised my voice again .
At the front lines , Velvet flung a rusty newspaper box with telekinesis , more to take away something that contributed to the bottleneck than to outright attack .   
It crashed hard , squealing as the metal side slid against the rough textured road .
That would be their answer , then ?
Fuck them .
Moose stepped forward , and Shortcut took a step to meet him .   
The road distorted , space rippling and appearing like water , spray and all , and he leaped forth at Moose ’s side .   
Shortcut was there , pole in motion , the blade at the end making the end heavy even as he used the dull side to connect with the back of Moose ’s leg .
Moose did n’t go down , and swatted in Shortcut ’s direction .   
Shortcut disappeared , appeared again , swinging .   
This time the blade was more apparent .   
Moose was forced to take a step back .
Bitter Pill had a group of six men and women around her , toward the back .   
They looked like zombies .   
Each had their heads lolling back , and black fluid flowed from their mouths like water from the edge of an overflowing sink .   
She was giving them orders , her voice lost in the other noises .
Mayday raised his hand , then brought it forward .   
The entire assembly of villains reacted .   
Etna , who wore a revealing robe in glossy silk , and a black mask with six horns , threw globs of superheated glass .   
The robed woman who drew the magic - circle diagrams raised her defenses , only to be caught off guard when Moose , feinting to throw Shortcut off , charged her .
Moose ’s charge meant much of Advance Guard leapt to the fray , Spright included , and Bitter Pill gave the order for her zombies to attack .   
They charged , spilling black fluid from their mouths in the same way someone with a very full jug of water might have water sloshing out .
That was Sveta and my cue to get involved .   
I flew forward .   
Sveta snatched out with a hand to pull one ’s ankle out from under it , dragging it into the middle of Advance Guard ’s ranks .
“
Do n’t hurt them !   
They ’re people !
”
someone called out behind us .
I changed direction , as I saw Love Lost get a boost from Snag , which segued into her running up the side of the building .   
Two long , lunging steps , with metal glittering around her one leg , dangling like extensive jewelry , damaged in an earlier fall or at some point in this altercation .
Still , she grabbed onto a windowsill , twisting around to reach up with her mask .
Sveta ’s hand went up .   
Love Lost shifted her grip , her back to the wall , arms out to either side to grip different windowsills with her claws .   
She refused to go down .
It did mean she could n’t remove her mask and scream .   
I flew skyward , out of the group assembled behind the bottleneck , toward the building ’s edge .
Nailbiter was keeping her eye out for me .   
In the midst of this kind of chaos , with this many witnesses , she could n’t go for the lethal strike , but she could interfere .
Brutes had a way of gravitating toward Brutes in a fight .   
It was a kind of weird rock - paper - scissors thing , where rock tended to favor smashing rock .
I used my forcefield to swat aside
Nailbiter
’s claws .   
So soon after the conversation with Sveta , to bring it out and be acutely aware of it , to think briefly of the hospital , it was disorienting .   
It made the moment dark .
More of Nailbiter ’s claws shielded Love Lost , keeping me from getting to her and pulling her free .   
Not directly .   
I saw Love Lost lower her head and raise her more intact clawed foot .   
She was using it as another hand .
Flying higher , I looked to Sveta .   
I reached out my hand , and she sent hers to me .
She pulled herself to me , then reached down , grabbing Love Lost from above .
To hold the windowsill and avoid being pulled down was one thing , but being pulled up was another .
Love Lost slashed , raking at Sveta ’s arm and tendrils .   
Sveta let go , and let Love Lost drop .
It was Snag who leaped out , flying in a straight line to catch the woman in one mechanical arm , before she could crash into the midst of the crowd of villains .
Sveta pulled herself back down to ground level .   
Meanwhile , I flew over the enemy group , putting myself behind the herd of enemies , while they scrambled to do something or get clear of the incoming Mayday projectile .
It was intimidating , being on the ground , while a ball of abstract energy the size of a one - car garage hurtled toward us .   
I was pretty sure it was very selective about who it affected , catching people up and depositing them in a way Mayday thought appropriate , but even with that , I found it distracting .
I ’d put myself close to Bitter Pill and her group .   
The thinkers , the clever ones .   
I used my aura , to pressure them , to catch their focus while the projectile sailed toward us .
It was Crested , folding fan in hand , who turned my way as I walked in their direction .   
All of the darkness of the hospital was in my eyes .   
My anger at everyone I could n’t change or fix was in my body language .   
The aura was one thing , but I could be the focus of those feelings of fear and awe that my power stirred in them .
Crested swung the fan .   
I knew what to expect , and I was n’t surprised when the fan spun , the folded metal slats multiplying , as the fan became a circle that became a spiral , each multiplied slat larger than the last .   
The effect was reminiscent of an ammonite fossil .   
A shield of interconnected metal slats that bit into the road and formed a wall between me and them .
“ Crested ! ”
Bluestocking called out .   
“
We need a barrier against- ” Crested started to fold it up , but it was too slow .   
I flew forward , forcefield up , and hit the barrier , just to add to the intimidation and shake the other guys .
I hit the barrier again .
It kept them from erecting a defense .   
Prancer grabbed Velvet and leaped up to higher ground .   
Others ran for cover in the last seconds .   
Some tried to approach me , to use the other side of Crest ’s barrier to defend themselves .   
I pushed out with my aura to discourage them in the last moment .
I was barely touched , as it washed over me like hot air from a hair dryer .   
Others were dragged a hundred feet down the road , pushed back and away from the bottleneck .   
Bluestocking ’s blue stocking was shredded by the contact with the road , stained red .
They were a jumbled heap .   
They had n’t pushed past the bottleneck or delivered a serious blow to Advance Guard before the bizarre siege weapon hit .
I flew back to our side .
“
Let ’s end this !
”
Mayday called out .
“
Are you surrendering ?   
Six of you and your two helpers , ” Prancer said .   
“
And-
”
Behind him , Beast of Burden was arriving with reinforcements .   
The leader of the violent clique .   
No blood , no barbs or spikes , but the armor he wore was steel , and it looked like slabs had been cut off of tank armor .   
Helmet blended into body armor , so broad and heavy it did n’t leave a hint of a neck .   
The helmet had bull ’s horns longer and thicker around than my leg and only slits for eyeholes .   
The chest armor was a slab shaped roughly like chest armor , and similar measures had been taken for the metal segments that encircled parts of his arms and legs .   
Cleat was with him , and Cleat was spiky in a way I ’d anticipated Beast of Burden being .
Beast of Burden , ‘ Bob’ , was quick for a guy wearing armor as heavy as his .
But we had reinforcements too .
At our rear , Capricorn , Rain , and Looksee were arriving .   
Looksee had her armor on , much as she ’d designed it .   
Four spheres at the back of her head , to encapsulate hair buns , five lenses at her face , lime green and gray color scheme .
Rain had gone with something relatively simple- a combination of loose clothing with a hood , a mask that made his face look like a robot ’s , and gloves that did much the same .   
He was n’t wearing extra arms .
Did he look sufficiently different to mask him for Love Lost and Snag ?   
Nothing about their expressions suggested anything .
We were gathered .   
All together , or as together as we could reasonably be .   
Chris had run off , and Ashley was on the other side , walking the fine line of being hard to manage and believable .
“
Hey , Mayday , ” Looksee said .
He was silent , as he turned to look at her .   
She had her flash gun out .








Orange motes began dancing around the trucks and railing that were serving to slow Prancer ’s group down .   
The people who had n’t been pushed very far back actually backed away from the motes .
Glowing particles from one parahuman could be harmless or negligible , they could be concentrated points of energy that cut through flesh like a hot knife through butter , or they could be concentrated points of energy that un - concentrated into sizable explosions , given an excuse .
I made a loop of the area , getting a better look at Beast of Burden
’s
violent capes that were on the right side of the street
-their
right , my left- and with a gap separating them , the other capes , with the thinkers and Prancer .   
I gave a wide berth to the particles , to help sell the idea they might be dangerous , and then landed beside Capricorn .
“ Holding up ?
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
Keep doing what you ’re doing .   
Do n’t set it off unless they get close .
”
“
That ’s the plan .   
Mayday , ” Tristan said .   
“ Good
to meet you .   
Are you caught up on things ?
”
“ Spright filled me in .   
This is your jurisdiction ?
”
I answered , “ We ’re babysitting it while other teams tour it .   
They liaise with us .   
That you did n’t says something went wrong .   
People are messing with us , Cedar Point , or both .
”
“
We can discuss that later , ” Mayday said .   
“
My team , Teri , Signal , Prong .   
Who ’s out ?
”
“ I know you might need me , but my focus is gone , ” the diagram woman said .
“
Go , ” he said .   
The word was barely out of his mouth when she went out like smoke dissipating into air .   
The smoke held the colors that had been her , initially covering the black of her costume
’s fabric , the dark blue armor panels , the lighter blue ‘ magic circle’ images on those panels , and her apparently near - black skin and hair .   
The smoke included the interior colors too , however .   
White for bone and fat , and lots of pinks and reds .
Within a second and a half , she was gone .
“ Prong , Signal Fire , we decide who to evac next depending on situation .
”
Five Advance Guard remained , with the five of us .   
We were outnumbered almost three to one by the collected villains of Cedar Point .
Spright , Mayday , Signal Fire , Prong , and one other .   
It was a woman with a short dress as part of her costume , leggings beneath , and long sleeves with the panels helping to form the bones of ‘ wings’ .   
The panels at the front of her mask swept along the sides of her head to form a wing pattern .
I was going to guess she was ‘ Flapper’ .   
A hard name to tie into the aesthetic of the Advance Guard .
Two mobile capes , and three that were waiting to be teleported out .   
I was betting
Mayday would be last .   
Once their group was small enough , I was betting they would make a break for it .   
We ’d want to be able to go too .
Capricorn ’s
orange motes were rising up and filling the area between buildings .
Past the curtain , I could hear Ashley ’s power .
“
Hey !
”
Prancer called out .   
“ Civilian property .   
They pay us , we leave their stuff alone .
”
Ashley said something I did n’t hear .   
Nailbiter sniggered .
Natalie was going to get upset with us again .
The standoff could n’t last .   
We were walking backward , putting distance between ourselves and the group , while the orange motes collected and filled the space .
“
Hi Signal , ” Looksee said .   
“
We did n’t interact for very long ,
but- ” “ Optic , ” Signal Fire said .
“
Yeah , ” she said .   
“
Except I changed my name .   
Trying one on for a fit , but a teammate was making fun of me for it .   
You actually remember me ?   
I thought you would n’t , maybe , because you had so many trainees-
”
“ I remember , ” he said .
“
Okay , ” she said .   
“
It ’s so nostalgic .   
It ’s been a while ,
Mayday- ”
“
Not the time , ” Mayday said .
“
Oh .   
Okay , ” she said .   
“
Okay .   
Shutting up now .
”
“
You know the kid ?
”
Flapper asked .
“
She was one of my Wards , once , ” he said .   
“
The less said , the better .
”
“
Wait , ” Spright said .   
“
Is she the one you mentioned ?
”
“
The less said , the better , ” Mayday said , in a tone that left no room for doubt .
“ Geez , ” Spright said .   
“ From the stuff I heard
, I thought she ’d look way different .   
Older .
”
“
Let ’s leave it , ” Mayday said .   
“
I should n’t have said anything in the first place .
”
“
Nice to know that people are talking about me , ” Looksee said , with a touch of sarcasm .   
“
We talked to Houndstooth , by the way .
”
“ It might be worth talking to him , ” I said .   
“
He can round out what Spright said .   
His team passed through .
”
“ I ’ll do that .   
He ’s a good one , ” Mayday said .   
There was a pause .   
“ We ’ve met and talked a few times .
”
“ Avenguard too ?
”
Looksee asked .
“
No comment , ” Mayday said .
“
I ’m missing context , ” Flapper said .
“ Why do n’t we focus on current events ?
” Sveta asked .
“ Please , ” Mayday said .
“ Spright , keep an eye on the ones to the left .   
Flapper , right .   
Intercept and obstruct for Signal and me to tag .
”
Rain raised a hand , pointing .   
To our left , on the other side of the barricade , a hand and arm of thin parts was reaching up , tips embedding into the side of the building and piercing through .
Nailbiter was climbing the building face , to get up and over the orange motes .
I flew toward her at the same time Spright started running in that direction .
Off on the other side of the street , Velvet sent a trash can sailing through the orange sparks .   
Metal rings held wooden slats in place , prettifying the exterior of a half - filled plastic bin .   
Trash emptied out as it turned over , and it passed harmlessly through the orange points of light and the trails they ’d left .
Testing them .
That was for others to handle .   
I was n’t looking at the time it happened , but at the corner of my vision , I saw the trash can change direction in the air .   
Sveta , possibly .
Nailbiter found her position on the wall , toes extended and digging in , and pulled one hand away to point it at Spright and me .
It was hard to tell how fast it was coming at me , because the individual fingers were so thin and their extension so fluid .   
I tried to judge it , flew to one side , and was struck regardless .
Before I could get hit again , I changed direction , letting myself fall down , away .   
I ’d had to deal with guns before .   
If I could n’t see the fingers and teeth stabbing for me , I would treat them as I might treat bullets .   
She was mobile , strong , and as far as I was concerned , she had powerful shotguns for fingers and teeth .
I landed hard on the ground , rolled , and let her dismiss me , changing her focus to Spright , who was flying up toward her , his arms extended , with fingers drawn out , long and thin .
I waited until they clashed , fingers striking one another like ten rapiers striking ten more , and then I flew , pushing off the ground for that miniscule extra boost .
Spright extended his arms , flying down while keeping his hands in place , his arms long and high above him .   
I could see the points of Nailbiter ’s teeth pass above him , saw her turn her head toward me-
With her being extended across so much of the wall , I had room to maneuver while still pressing the attack .   
I went low instead , seized her ankle with the wretch manifesting around me , and hauled her back and away from the wall .
It was n’t an easy or immediate process to dislodge her .   
In another circumstance , I might not have been able to budge her .   
In this circumstance , gravity helped a bit .   
She could n’t do a lot to keep herself from having those long needle - fingers pulled out of the wall , except to extend them further .
Sidepiece hurled something at me , and it exploded against the wall , a foot from my head .   
I glanced at her , saw her tear one of her exaggerated ribs out from beneath a cutoff t - shirt with so much cut off from the bottom
it was indecent , above a stomach that looked like a zombie ’s , with flesh bloody , raw and open where literal pounds of flesh had been torn away .
The spine and area around it were intact , as was the navel and stomach on the opposite side , but the sides were completely gone .
She flung it at me .   
I let go of Nailbiter , flew down , and hit the ground with an impact , my aura flared out .   
I did n’t stop for half a second before immediately taking off again .
“
Do n’t fucking hit me , ‘ piece !
”
Nailbiter screeched the words behind me , but the manner of speaking was even worse , as her teeth were retracting .
Again , I used my aura as I touched wall , not as heavy an impact , but I hit the edge of a window frame , and it made glass rattle .   
Aura out , harder than before .
I zig - zagged , ground to wall , wall to a point high overhead , point above to ground again .   
I made each point of contact with a surface something they had to pay attention to , putting them off guard , making Sidepiece have to turn around .
I took off again , flying toward her , aura at full blast .
Straight line , impact , straight line , impact , the pattern was ingrained .   
I flew toward her , the impact a damn promise I ’d made , and then changed course in the air , veering away from Sidepiece , aura stopping abruptly .
She threw a rib , but it was a throw she ’d been planning to throw at me while I charged at her .   
It went far afield , sailing in the direction of Capricorn , Mayday , and the rest of the group , and hit the road .
She did n’t have time to get another pound of flesh ready to hurl at me .
Nailbiter was getting herself situated after the adjustments she ’d made to try to cling to the building , one of her hands out , fending off Spright .   
She saw me coming , but too late .   
I hooked my arm around her middle , her long torso in the crook of my elbow , and I pulled her away from the wall , successfully this time .
Once I ’d pulled her away , she was flailing , searching for something to hold onto .   
I did n’t give her the opportunity to get a grip or find an angle to get me .   
I checked the coast was clear and tossed her down .
“ Capricorn !
”
I called out .
“
Okay , ” I heard him say , a distance away .
Nailbiter landed across the truck , surrounded by orange motes .   
The motes solidified , turning into the ridged white stone with orange - yellow veins running through it .
Nailbiter was stuck , part of her torso , her butt , and one arm caught in Capricorn ’s stone .   
The wall covered a considerable height , reaching up to the second story of the neighboring buildings , with some isolated spikes reaching up to the third .
I landed on the wall , and Spright landed right beside me .   
He reached out with one extended hand , flexing it .
“
I love the changer forms I get to steal , ” he said .   
“
They last for so much longer than other stuff , and I get more of the offensive side of it than I do with other stuff .   
This is great .   
Thank you , Nailbiter .
”
“
Fuck yourself !
”
she screamed , voice distorted .   
She reached back with her one free hand .   
Both Spright and I leaned back and used the top edge of the wall for cover as the extended fingers stabbed upward , thin .
“
Do that again , and I ’ll return the favor , ” Spright said .
“ Stay put , Nailbiter , ” I said .   
I looked at Spright .   
“ You should go .   
I can do more against them like this , and if you wait too long you wo n’t be able to catch up with the others .
”
“
No objection , ” Spright said .   
He somersaulted backward off of the wall .
Our group was running , now .   
The only reason they had n’t run earlier was that the bottleneck had been too important , too essential to keep the villains from coming at them as a mob .   
Now there was a wall dividing the two groups .
I had the bird ’s eye view as I stood on top of the wall .   
Damsel began shooting at the wall , putting holes in it , while Moose stepped back , assessing the situation .
I flew down to the wall , close enough to Nailbiter that I was pretty sure Moose would n’t come tearing through the wall and trample me .
My back to the wall , hands out and pressed to the uneven surface , I waited until I felt the vibrations of Moose ’s running footsteps .   
It was hardly necessary , because Nailbiter kicked with her legs and screeched something at him , loud enough that Advance Guard and the therapy team could be aware of what was happening .
I pushed out with my aura , hard , extending it through the wall .
The thudding footsteps stopped .
On the other side , I heard Moose ’s voice , then a laugh .
Yeah .
Gave him pause , at least .
He did n’t charge the wall , but he did punch one gauntleted fist through it .   
A moment later , another fist came through .   
He grabbed the intervening bit of stone and hauled on it , pulling out a chunk .
I backed away , facing the wall and Nailbiter
’s rear end .
Moose peered through the hole .
“
We meet again , ” he said .
“
Sorry about the face , ” I said .
He moved his metal mask a bit to one side , showing me the three grooves that ran from the corner of his jaw to his cheekbone .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“ Sorry .
”
“ I got a compliment from a girl , she thought it was gnarly , ” he said .   
“
It ’s not all bad .
”
“
Stop fucking flirting and get us through , Moose !
”
someone called out , on the other side of the wall .   
Velvet , I was guessing .
“
My mom would cry if she saw it , though , ” Moose said .   
He lurched forward , shouldering his way through the hole he ’d made , leaving a Moose - shaped hole behind him .
On the other side , I could see Prancer ’s entire group backed away as segments of the stone came crashing down behind Moose .   
More time , more delay for our side .
Delay that would be needed , it seemed .   
Moose was fast on his feet , more than super strength and good form might have suggested- each footstep seemed to produce a focused blast where his feet landed , a geyser of dust behind the ball of each foot , blasting out to five feet behind him .   
There was Prancer in his breaker state .
Just behind Prancer , Velvet drove a truck through the hole Moose had made , the side view mirror on one side scraping off on the wall
’s edge .   
Capes were in the vehicle and perched on top .
They ’d been smugglers , suppliers , and getaway drivers , in another life .   
It made sense they could move when they needed to .   
Normally it meant them getting away , but here it applied to the chase .
I could n’t catch Prancer , and I was n’t going to throw myself headlong at a truck filled with what had to be a half dozen people with powers .
I could have gone for Moose , but I did n’t want to make his mom cry any more than she might , and he was moving fast enough and hard enough
I was n’t sure I could stop him without causing reams of property damage .
Better to go back to the others .   
They ’d rounded a corner , and were heading northward , toward the main highway and the train tracks .   
I flew direct to them , putting myself ahead of Prancer and his entourage .
I flew alongside the others .   
Looksee was keeping up , inexplicably , and it was Rain who was lagging .   
Capricorn had one hand at his shoulder .
Mayday , just to Capricorn ’s right , was n’t the fastest either .   
Prong was gone , and Mayday and Signal Fire were the only ones left in Advance Guard who did n’t have mover abilities .
Spright had the benefit of both Flapper ’s power and the lingering effect of Nailbiter ’s transformation .   
That put him well ahead of the rest .
That seemed to be his thing .   
Always staying ahead , always with just a bit of an edge in mobility .
“ They ’re coming .   
Moose and Prancer are charging in .   
Velvet has a car , ” I reported .
“
Got it , ” Capricorn said .
I saw the orange lines moving across the road .   
I could see the pattern and the logic .   
Rush jobs , but they snapped into being as Rain and Mayday passed over them .   
Rows of spiky growth across the road .
“ I could use my power , but I ’d rather keep it under wraps , ” Rain said .
“
Do , ” Tristan said .   
“ Have your gun ready .
”
Gun ?   
Erin ’s ?
The villains rounded the corner behind us , and they started catching up .   
Moose saw the spikes and bent low while running , tearing his hands through them , scattering whole chunks of them in passing , not even slowing in stride .
Moose broke more of the spike strips .   
Prancer ran up one of the horn - ridden poles while it was still moving through the air
, the butt end slamming against the ground as he put his feet on the ridged spikes .   
He planted a foot on the end as the pole tilted toward the ground , pointing in our general direction , and leaped , hard .
I pushed out with my aura , hard , and flew to intercept , forcefield down .
He was quick , and determined enough the aura did n’t give him much pause .   
I drove an elbow in his direction , normal human strength , and his fingers found the crook of that elbow .   
He leveraged that into half - pulling , then half - kicking himself over my arm and shoulder .   
Lighter than he looked , and he ’d used me as a stepping stone , closing the distance further .
Sveta ’s hand caught him before he could grab Rain from behind .   
She pulled herself to him and possibly by dint of him being as light as he was , him to her .   
They met halfway , and crashed in a heap .   
The breaker form dissipated .
Sveta was quick enough to recover that I did n’t even reach her side before she was up , reaching out .   
Her feet skidded on the road for the first moments as she hauled herself away from the defeated Prancer , Moose almost on her .
“
Stop them !
”
Prancer called out to Moose .
The big guy had only slowed slightly , to check on his friend , and now he picked up speed .   
Behind him , Velvet was driving her truck through gaps that were narrower than the spacing between the truck ’s tires .   
She veered to one side , then the other , and possibly augmented by her power , drove the truck tilted on one side , only the rightmost wheels making contact with the ground to pass through the gaps Moose had made .   
The guy on the roof of the truck was a good two hundred feet away , but I could still see the whites of his eyes as he held on for dear life .
The group carried on making a break for it .   
As Advance Guard left , we ’d have to figure out what to do with our team .   
I was n’t sure if their teleporter would be able to evacuate us in the same way .
Ahead of the group , Anxiety Chris was at the corner of the street , clutching at his face with all of his legs .   
He screamed as he saw us coming .
Spright picked up the pace , flying in his direction with a combination of my flight and Flapper
’s , his arms with extended fingers buoying him forward , like bat wings without the webbing between .   
He touched ground , running , making a beeline straight for the guy .
I wanted to call out a warning , but I was n’t sure if it was right to .   
I ’d have been outing Chris’ role in our group .
His power affects the mind .
“
Do n’t !
” Sveta called out .
“ We do n’t know what it is !
”
I added .
Spright ignored us both .   
Again .
Screaming without pausing for breath , Chris traveled the ‘ S’-shaped route , trying to take evasive action , and Spright remained on his … not heels .
“ Give ! ”
Spright called out , as he drew closer , until he could almost touch Chris .
They remained like that for a brief while , Chris trying to escape , Spright chasing .   
The screaming continued .
Spright ’s pace slowed , and he let Chris run away .   
Spright glanced back at everyone else , assessed the situation , and then took flight , putting himself closer to Flapper .
“
We ’re close !
”
Capricorn called out .
So he had a destination in mind .   
Good .
The van had stopped to collect Prancer , but it was catching up .   
Moose continued to bear on us .
I ’d have to intercept him if he got too close , I knew .
I could still imagine the scene of his face erupting in blood as the wretch clawed it .
Further ahead , I could see what Capricorn had done while he was waiting around .   
A wall of his stone barred the street .   
There were gaps wide enough for people to pass through .   
Three gaps , and the group was more than three people .   
Some members of the group turned around , ready to help and run interference while others slipped through the doors in single - file .
At the side window , Etna climbed out , reaching , and hurled globs of molten glass .
I intercepted the first , forcefield going up at the last second as I swatted it aside , aiming it in Moose ’s general direction .
“
Incoming !
”
I called out , because I could n’t intercept the second .
The group looked back and saw the incoming white - hot orb .   
People moved out of the way .   
Looksee did n’t .   
The glob hit her across the head , which struck the wall behind her hard .
The camera with the projection device mounted on it clattered on its way to hit the road , the final landing muted as it landed glass - side down .
“ Aauuughhh ! ”
Looksee cried out , in a not - very - convincing agonized scream .   
“
I ’m dying , I ’m dead !   
Auughh !
”
“ Looksee , ” I heard Rain say .
Moose came to a halt , standing by the southeastern corner of a small apartment building , while we stood at the northeastern corner .   
The truck skidded to a stop .   
People had stopped in their tracks .   
Some eyes were on Etna .
“
Mayday , I loved you , you were awesome .   
Signal Fire , you were a great teacher .   
Team , you ’re the best , I love you with all my heart !   
Remember me , avenge me !
”
“ Looksee , they know it ’s a projection , ” Rain said .
“
Shit on me , did not want this today , ” Mayday said .
It did n’t seem like Looksee had heard , from her tone .
“ I know , duh , ” the camera said , the ‘ oh’ sound at the end of the word stuttering slightly .   
She laughed , enthusiastic .   
“
I ’m just having fun .
”
The villains were still back there .   
They were unloading from the truck .   
Some expressions were sober , others were dangerous .
“ You ’re willing to go this far ?
”
I called out .   
“ Shooting a kid ?
”
“ I thought you ’d catch it , ” Etna said , her voice small both because she was far away , and because of disappointment in herself , it seemed .   
She was more Prancer ’s camp , if I remembered right , despite the dangerous power that might otherwise have put her in Beast ’s .
“ If she ’d been real , ” I said .   
“
This would have been a fuck - up of the highest order .
”
“ If she ’d been real , ” Beast of Burden said , making the truck bounce as he climbed out of the back , “
She still would have been causing trouble on our turf .   
It would n’t have been undeserved .
”
“
No , ” Prancer said .
“
Yes , ” Beast of Burden said .
“
No , ” Prancer said .   
“
That ’s not how we ’re playing this .
”
“
It ’s not how you ’re playing this , ” the man replied .    
He was shorter than Moose , he was n’t especially greater in size , but the massive horns of his helmet were as wide across as Moose ’s musclebound Brute shoulders , and his armor had to have added three hundred pounds of weight to a two hundred pound frame .   
“ If they do n’t want you and if you ’re willing to play for keeps , Etna , I ’ll take you .
”
“
No thanks , ” Etna said .
“
We ’re in this together , ” Moose said .   
“
Let ’s not ruin that .
”
“
No , ” Beast of Burden said .   
“
No we ’re not .
”
Disjoint had been the one on the roof .   
He went to Beast ’s side .   
Nailbiter had stayed behind , for obvious reasons , Damsel had n’t been invited onto the truck , and Sidepiece had n’t made it on .
Snag was present , he ’d been in the back of the truck too , but we ’d heard his stance on the cliques and groupings .   
His glowering mask looked especially ominous in the moment , as he stared us down .   
He could n’t have known his cluster - mate was part of this group , staring at him at the same time .
Either way , he was n’t part of Beast ’s clique .   
Love Lost might have gravitated in that direction , but she had n’t come .
Still , the two members of Beast ’s clique were standing apart , and Beast was breaking away .
“
Do this again , and I ’ll kill one of you , ” Beast said .   
“
You come to fight or take a stand , be prepared for a fight .
”
“
Stupid , ” Prancer said .
Beast of Burden shaking his head was dramatic , with the horns on his helmet swinging .   
“
Necessary .   
You can wrap this mess up yourself .   
Put a fucking bow on it for all I care , deer man .
”
He turned to walk away , shaking his head .   
A nervous Disjoint followed .
Prancer looked between Beast of Burden and those of us who had n’t ducked through the Capricorn ’s wall .
Rain bent down and picked up Looksee ’s camera , shaking it slightly , as if that would dislodge the cooling black glass that caked part of it .
“ Cameras , ” Prancer said .
Rain nodded .
Prancer raised a hand to his head , found hair that was sticking up after his tumble of a fall , and pressed it down , running fingers through it to try to set it in place .   
“
How long ?
”
“ Long enough , ” I said .   
“
We know you ’re bleeding people of cash , when they do n’t have enough .   
You ’re using this place to run drugs to the rest of the city , and you’re- you were giving safe haven to crooks like Nailbiter .   
Who took a teenager away from her parents earlier today .
”
“ If you take me out , someone like Beast is going to take my place .
”
“ If I leave you where you are , that ’s going to happen too .   
Someone stronger and meaner will take you out , and they ’ll be very hard to dislodge because of what you ’ve already set in place .
”
“
This is n’t you , Prancer , ” Sveta said .   
She was perched on Capricorn ’s wall .
“
It is n’t , you ’re right , ” he said .
“
Stop .   
Disband , ” I said .
“
No , ” Prancer said .   
“
This role is n’t me .   
I have a lot I need to learn , but I ’ll change until I fit the role .   
I think most of these guys will work with me to do it .   
We need this .
”
Velvet put her hand on his shoulder .
“
Your people are organizing to mount a war right under your nose , ” I said .   
“ Against acceptable targets , yes , but
if you think today was a bad day ?   
You ’re underestimating just how bad it ’s going to get when the Fallen come after you , and the damage they ’ll do to everyone and everything between them and you .
”
“ Not under my nose , ” Prancer said .   
He looked back at Snag .   
“ We ’ll manage .
”
“ You need to keep your mouth shut about that , ” Snag growled .
“
No .   
You need to loop the Wardens in .   
Get the full picture , get help .   
If you fight them , you need to win , unequivocally .
”
“ It ’s handled , ” Snag said .   
“
And if you do n’t keep your mouth shut , you ’ll be sabotaging it .
”
“
These are people the PRT could n’t stamp out , ” I said .
“
It ’s handled , ” Prancer said , echoing Snag .   
“
This is n’t about the PRT , or about heroes and villains .
”
“
What ’s it about , then ?
” Sveta asked .   
I had to look past Rain to see her .   
He was remaining silent .
“
It ’s about monsters , ” Prancer said , pacing slowly .
“ Speaking of .   
Garotte ?
”
“
That ’s not my name , ” Sveta said .
“
Circe says hi , ” Prancer said .
I could see Sveta ’s expression change .
“
Yeah , ” Prancer said .   
“
If you ’d only arrived a few hours later .   
Whatever .   
We have resources .   
This is about standing on our own two feet .   
If we do this raid right , no matter how you interfere , no matter what Beast does , breaking off with his people , Cedar Point is going to be a thing .
”
“
You do this wrong , and a whole lot of people are going to wish they were dead ,
” I said .
Prancer continued pacing for a few seconds , then stopped .
“
That ’s fine , ” he said .
“ If you ’re willing to involve those people in this , we might have to stop playing nice ,
” I said .
Prancer sniffed out a small laugh .   
“
Alright then .   
Moose ?
” Moose turned his head to Prancer , then to us .
“
Sorry , ” he said , smacking the knuckles of his gauntlet into his palm .   
Without any more preamble or prelude , he charged us .
Rain backed toward the door , the loose sleeve of his costume covering his one hand , while he held the glass - caked camera .   
He withdrew the flash gun , pointing it at the enemy group .
I turned my head , covering my eyes with my arm .   
The gun was n’t even aimed at me , my eyes were shut , and my arm was in the way , and the darkness of my vision still turned pink , shaded slightly by bones between me and the group .
Rain emptied the gun , firing again and again .   
From the changes in the flash ’s angles , he was moving while firing .
Moose crashed into the wall , rather than into any of us .
The flashing had stopped , and I flew skyward .   
I deemed myself safe to look , and saw as the others ducked through the openings in the very thick wall , Tristan sealing the apertures behind them .   
Moose sat on the ground , and the rest looked bewildered .
I shook my head and flew to the others .
⊙ We were all gathered .   
Advance Guard ’s group was assembled in entirety , including the supporting members of the group .   
I warily watched as a healer cape did his work .   
Flickering images overlapped as he pressed his hand down on ReSound ’s shoulder .
Nothing like Amy .   
It still bothered me .   
True healing powers were something comprehensive and powerful , to cover the bases necessary for all the various sicknesses and maladies , while also wreaking meaningful change .   
Powers themselves did n’t lend themselves to healing , as a general rule , either .   
Not unless they were selfish .
Even the strongest self - healers I ’d met had been pretty fucked up .   
Crawler had been one .
Rescue was present , the teleporter who pulled people away .   
Mapwright was a straggler , a woman with a limp .   
She went to Mayday ’s side , and they clasped hands .   
The place where their hands met glowed a soft pink , and then Mayday ’s eyes glowed pink behind his mask .
“
Who ’s that a block to the north ?
” he asked .
“ Civilians .   
Kids eating popsicles , ” Mapwright said .
“ Then we ’re clear to talk , ” Mayday said .   
He pulled off his helmet .   
He did the thing a lot of capes with helmets did , wearing a basic mask beneath .   
He was thirty - five or so , had warm black skin , with a very long face and sharp chin , arching eyebrows , a thin mustache at his upper lip , and a line of beard from the middle of his lip to his chin .   
His head was shaved .
His face did n’t really match the impression he gave with his helmet on , with the broader , triangular face panels .   
That was part of the point , I supposed .
“
This was a clusterfuck , ” I said .   
“
We ended up showing ourselves , you pointed out our surveillance , you disturbed the peace , and the entire situation got more chaotic .
”
“ Easy , ” Capricorn said .
“
She ’s not wrong , ” Rain said .
“ I know , ” Capricorn said .   
“
But … easy .   
I do n’t want to be enemies with Advance Guard .
”
“
No , ” Mayday said .   
“
The sentiment is mutual .
”
“ I agree .   
It ’s not the kind of thing we need these days .   
But I ’m upset , ” I said .   
“
We just had to play a lot of our cards that I really would have rather kept up our sleeve .   
I ’d love to know why .
”
“ Spright said he explained .
”
“
But he could n’t tell us who gave you the okay .
”
“ We had messages .   
Cedar Point was asking for help , Civilians asked us .   
It ’s not a shock .   
We ’re prominent , ” Mayday said .
“
Can you forward those to us ?   
Help us trace them ?
” I asked .   
“
I think it ’s more likely
a mastermind in the background pulled this .
”
“
Believe it or not , we ’re prominent , ” Shortcut said .   
“
It ’s a hell of
a lot more likely people thought they needed help and called us than this conspiracy idea of yours .
”
“
Did you talk to Foresight ?
”
I asked , ignoring Shortcut .
“ We did , ” Mayday said .   
“
The leadership is wrapped up in a war-
” “
Thought so , ” Sveta said , voice soft .
“
-and we communicated with one of their lieutenants .
” “ Communicated how ?
” I asked .
“
Oh my god , ” Shortcut said , his head rolling back .
“ Email , ” Mayday said .   
“ One phone call .
”
“
Can you verify those exchanges for us ?
” I asked .   
“
I know someone who saw two attempts to hack their email .
”
“ Some people in the Wardens had the same , ” Mayday said .   
“ Legal .
”
“
Same people , ” I said .   
“
It ’s not out of the question someone managed to spoof something at you , threw out bait .
”
“ That we bit ?
”
Spright asked .
I shrugged .
“
We ’ll look into it and let you know , ” Mayday said .   
“
We ’ll figure this out .
”
Looksee wiggled , sitting on the curb .   
“
I ’m psyched to be working together again .
”
“ We ’re not working together , Optics , ” Mayday said .
“ Looksee , ” she replied , quiet .
“ Looksee , ” he said .   
He paused , then said .   
“
No . ”
“ You need to explain this to me , ” Flapper said .   
“
Because as far as I can tell , you ’re being uncharacteristically shitty to a kid , and you ’re good with kids .
”
“ He ’s not being shitty , ” Looksee said .   
“
He ’s nice .   
No need to get into it .
”
“ I think there ’s kind of a need to get into it , ” Flapper said .   
“ Please .   
This is going to bother me .
”
“
This is the kid , ” Spright said .   
“ Cost him his promotion .
”
“ Not directly , ” Mayday said .   
“ Flapper , if you ’d just take my word for things and leave this , I ’d appreciate it .
”
“ I would if it was the only thing that went sideways today , ” she said .   
“
I ’ve seen teammates compromised , acting strange .   
Some were because of drugs , others were Strangered .   
Two things in the same day ?   
Just … explain ?
”
Mayday folded his arms .   
“
She went from institutions to being a PRT focus in Baltimore .   
Not a concern , not an asset … something between .   
She went from there to training camps , moving her around
so she could n’t get too attached to anyone .   
San Diego included .   
Signal Fire ?
”
Signal Fire explained , “ Coworker of mine was investigated .   
Looksee left her computer open and kids messed with it , changing her online profiles .   
They found photos , they took the computer to people in charge .
”
“
So embarrassing , ” Looksee said .   
I went to stand next to her , and put my hand on her shoulder .
Sveta sat down next to her .   
Looksee leaned into her .
“ Kid in a swimsuit , hanging out with an instructor at a hotel pool , all smiles , the two of them hanging out , pictures of them shopping , eating out of a food truck , being in places he should n’t have been near .   
They looked close .   
Questions were raised , answered pretty quickly , because of kid ’s prior history , but it still had to be investigated .   
It was n’t wholly impossible he was skipping patrols and hanging out with the kid instead .
”
“ Doctored photos , ” Mayday said .   
“ Kid was lonely , thought photos of her and the instructor she liked most would be nice to have .   
BFF close , in the pictures , which looks weird when the guy is fifteen years older than her .
”
“ I know that now , ” Looksee said , quiet .
“
Then she goes to the parahuman Asylum , and from the Asylum to Baltimore , with Youth Guard getting involved .   
Baltimore .   
We have an inner city , we have gangs , we have some troubled kids in our Wards .   
Had .   
I hate to outright say it , Looksee , because I do think you ’re a good kid-
”
“
Everyone says so , but I did bad stuff , ” she said .
“
Uninformed stuff , ” he said , gently .   
“ But bad ,
yeah .   
It was more trouble to deal with her than to wrangle all the other Wards combined .   
I get out of the toilet stall in the men ’s room and this kid is sitting on the counter by the sink , waiting , has been for twenty minutes , dead silent for the first time in her life , because she wants to talk to me .   
There are n’t cameras in the bathrooms .   
It ’s a blind spot .   
How does that look ?
”
“
Sorry , ” Looksee said .
“ She works herself to the bone , it looks bad for the department .   
She intentionally misses the bus or fakes hours
so she can spend more time with us
, so we have to have people drive her home or pick her up .   
Which also looks bad , because it ’s time spent alone or in proximity to a kid who is n’t just vulnerable , but throws herself headlong at people who prey on the vulnerable .   
Kidnappers , people who would work a tinker to the bone , people who want to hurt the PRT .
”
“ Threw , not throws , ” Looksee said .   
“
Okay , maybe throws a bit , but only a little .
”
“
It was a hundred things like that .   
It was everything that could have made the Youth Guard crawl up our ass to light warning fires .   
We could have hired two new capes from elsewhere if it was n’t for the fines and administration costs .
”
“
Sorry again .
”
“
She ’s doing way better , ” Capricorn said .
“
Good .
”
“
She ’s a great kid .   
Talented as hell , ” Capricorn said .
“
I ’ve talked to Houndstooth , Avenguard , and Spotter .   
I think you ’ll find we ’re mostly on the same page , ” Mayday said .   
“
We do n’t disagree , necessarily , but …
”
Looksee nodded very quickly .   
I gave her shoulder a rub .
“
Except I do n’t know if I ’m as nice as they are , ” Mayday said , not finishing the thought he ’d left to trail off .   
“
I took over the department because that kid sank my predecessor .   
The question mark hovering over the bathroom thing was part of what cost me one golden opportunity to get up to the Protectorate core team , during the final year , when we were dealing with the new Endbringer situation .   
She ruined a lot of careers , teachers , heroes , social workers , and I ca n’t be fair to her because I ’m pretty fucking bitter about it .
”
“
You could try , ” I said .
“ I could .   
I wo n’t .   
Advance Guard is walking away .   
Consider it a blessing , if you want .   
We do n’t usually back off .   
But we ’ll do it here , ” he said , glancing at Looksee .   
“
We ’ll give you Cedar Point to look after , I ’ll ask about what you said , look into the possible hack and validity of the emails .   
Spright-
you get stuff in their office ?
”
“ I went where Mapwright showed me , ” Spright said .   
“
But we did n’t get that far .   
These guys wanted me to go straight to you .   
We spent most of our time figuring it out .
”
Mayday said , “ That ’s not your usual , Spright .   
You ’re more of a scoundrel than that .
”
“ Pretty girl- pretty girls tell me to get moving , give me a convincing reason ?
” Spright asked .   
He offered an amused chuckle , looking at Sveta and me .   
“ I might listen properly for once .
”
“
You ’ve never listened to me , ” Flapper said , archly .
“ Or me , ” Mapwright said .
ReSound did n’t say anything , but she cleared her throat .
Spright chuckled nervously .
Mayday raised a finger , while Spright ’s head was turned toward Flapper .   
Beside Spright , Signal Fire reached out to seize his arm .
“
What gives ?
”
Mayday walked up to him , seizing his other arm .   
With his free hand , Mayday patted Spright down .
He reached beneath a flat armor panel , and withdrew a notebook with a rubber band around it .
He tossed it to Capricorn .
“ Amends , ” Mayday said .   
His expression was solemn .   
“ Good luck .
”
They went on their way .
⊙ I paged through the notebook .   
It was a ledger , devoid of numbers .   
Transactions as barter , with a great deal of shorthand .
We knew what the truck was , now .   
With all of the preparations for war , a truckload of guns had made a disappearance .   
Prancer knew where it was .
He was a proper arms dealer , now .   
It was n’t an insignificant number of guns .
We had notes on the other work he was doing .   
Drugs .   
Robbery for hire , moving things between the illicit , villain - run camps on corner worlds .   
There were plans for other things .   
In the future , he seemed to have two days where he and his people would be moving humans .   
It was n’t clear why or for what purpose , but they were to be delivered from one corner world to another .
Once they realized the notebook was gone , they would change their plans .
Kenzie was all smiles , so excited from the excursion and her involvement in it that the issue with Mayday seemed to breeze past her .   
Still , we were leaving her mostly alone , with Sveta keeping her company .    
I could remember her blowing up over her bag .
Some of Kenzie ’s attention was on Ashley .   
Damsel was still in Cedar Point , giving us a window into what Beast of Burden was doing .   
For the time being , he was having beers with his clique .   
They were to remain in Cedar Point , but they ’d have their own corner of things .   
They would leave Prancer alone if they were left alone , but I doubted things would remain that way .   
One group or the other would grow .
For the time being , Beast and Damsel ’s group told war stories .   
Nailbiter , agitated , had left a bit ago .   
We ’d tracked her on the camera as she met up with Colt and a young guy .   
The three of them went for a walk along the waterline ,
Nailbiter asking about ’employees’ , the young guy answering , while Colt remained silent unless spoken to .
I finished reading through the notebook and handed it to Rain , who was working on his arms .   
The mask and sleeves were set aside , Kenzie ’s work , not his .
His expression was grim .
“ How are you dealing ?
” I asked .
“
It was my day , ” he said .   
“
And I could n’t even use my power without stirring up more trouble than it was worth .
”
“ We need to talk about things , ” I said .
“
Tomorrow , ” he said .   
“ Not
today .   
Please ?   
Today ’s been rough .
” I nodded .   
I pushed the notebook in his direction .
Chris had the corner , his back to us , and he was hunched over a video game .   
Oblivious to the rest of the world , drawn into his shell .
Tristan and I were the ones without a place to be .   
I met his eyes , and I walked out to the fire escape .
He joined me .
I stood by the railing at the little balcony - landing outside the door .   
Tristan sat on the top stair .
“
You were trying to keep Kenzie from being alone in the building , ” I said .   
“
And from being alone with Erin and Rain .
”
“
Yeah .
”
“ Keeping Sveta and I together .
”
“
No manipulation or strategy there .   
You two fit .
”
“
Do I need to worry ?
” I asked .
“
That ’s a loaded question , ” he said .
“
Can I trust you ?
”
He did n’t answer me .
“ Or
is it that you do n’t trust them ?
” I asked .
“
It ’s a really fucked up thing , if I consider myself one of the more trustworthy members of the group , ” he said .   
He turned around to look up at me .   
“
Rain-
he ’s in a bad place .
”
“
In more than one way , ” I said .
“
Yeah .
”
“ I did n’t want to ask him , but
… what Fallen family is he from ?   
The last time I ran into Fallen , they were Crowleys , but …
it ’s not
just Crowleys left , in Gimel , and the Crowleys would be bad enough .
”
“ I do n’t think he ’s living with the Crowleys , ” Tristan said .   
“
But he wo n’t tell me .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .
If we were people who ’d been powerless once , set out to help the powerless , that might mean Rain and Erin were people who were very high on our list of people to help .   
He ’d brought her for a reason .   
Had he expected her to communicate with us ?   
Or was her presence meant to communicate something ?
“
One last question , ” I said .
“ Go for it , ” Tristan said .
“
The hand signal earlier today , ” I said .   
I mimed it , hand not with palm facing forward at Tristan , but at an angle , so palm would be facing his feet instead , were he standing up .
“
Hm ?   
I thought that was obvious .
”
I shook my head .
“ Stop , ” Tristan said , palm out , facing forward .   
He pointed forward with three fingers , “ Go .
”
“
And … ?
”
He made the gesture .   
“ Go slow .   
Ease up .   
I figured it was intuitive .
”
I chuckled under my breath .
“ Not at all , ” I said .
Tristan smiled .
“
You were wanting to juggle the group , ” I said .
“ Feeling my way through it , ” he said .   
“
This is new to me .   
I ’m worried
I ’m going to fuck it up .   
Rain ’s my friend .   
I care about them all .   
Even Chris , God help me .
” I hesitated before speaking .
“ Is it- is it okay
that I ’m here ?
” I asked .   
“
I ’m not making things worse by being here ?
”
“
No .   
I do n’t think you are , ” he said .   
“
We need the help .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .   
“
Good .   
It would be pretty hard for me to walk away at this point , if you said no .
”
“
Yeah .   
Probably , ” he said .
We sat for a bit .   
There was n’t much more conversation .   
I was tired , after waking up early , and the adrenaline was long gone , leaving me weary to the bone , even though I had n’t exerted myself that much on a physical level .
When Tristan stood and stretched , I took that as an unspoken cue .   
We went back inside .
It would have been tidy and neat for more to happen before we packed up for the day , but it seemed everyone involved was licking wounds or replenishing their batteries in their individual ways .   
I could hear Ashley ’s voice , volume lowered on the camera , as she ranted about something , and Beast of Burden chimed in with monosyllables .   
Prancer looked after his territory , cleaning up the rubble from the walls , talking to people , trying to get sorted .
Love Lost and Snag emerged from their apartment building , and Love Lost
’s leg was fixed .   
They stood outside for a while , Snag talking periodically , making comments .
It was right when we were getting packed up to go , Kenzie had dinner with her parents and Rain
had to take Erin back to the camp , that things started moving again in Cedar Point .
A camper van pulled up and parked in the middle of the street , near where the bottleneck had been .   
The people that emerged were Case Fifty - threes .
Sveta went tense .
“
Do you know them ?
” Kenzie asked .
“ Circe , ” Sveta said .   
“ Whippersnap .   
Bristle .   
He must have researched me or asked Tattletale about me , and then reached out to them after .   
They were teammates , once .   
They know me .
”
“
You talked about them in group , ” Tristan said .
Sveta nodded .
Other cars were pulling up .   
I looked at the clock .   
It was six in the evening .   
This was a pre - arranged meeting time .
This time , the cars were sleek .   
Six black cars , one large truck .
The drivers remained in their seats , and the occupants of the vehicles exited out the backs .
“
These are ones you should know , ” Tristan said .   
To me .
I recognized Tattletale , from the lead car .   
She had a kid with a bird on his shoulder with her .   
She smiled .
I saw Snuff , and I saw other assorted henchmen .   
Soldiers , like Coil had once used .
In one of the cars further back , Imp climbed out .   
Eerie to see her older , now .
There was a crew of kids with her , all wearing masks .
Parian .   
She had been a rogue .   
Turned to the dark side .   
Flechette .   
For the briefest period of time , she had been a teammate .   
She went by Foil now
, I was pretty sure .
The truck ?   
Rachel Lindt .   
Hellhound .   
Bitch .   
She had a bevy of dogs .
The Undersiders chatted like long - lost friends .   
Tattletale was exempt , standing back , smiling .
There were others I did n’t recognize .   
They ’d gathered capes .   
Henchmen , teammates , connections .   
Big and small .
Cars were still pulling up and parking as I watched Tattletale approach Prancer to shake his hand .   
Her Undersiders were at her back .   
I could see Nursery in the background .   
I spotted someone who might have been Kingdom Come .
I then saw her put her gloved hand in Snag ’s large mechanical one , shaking it .   
She smiled like it was a joke
she got that nobody else did .
“
They ’re meeting about the attack , ” Sveta said .
“
Or they ’re making it tonight ,
” Tristan said .   
He put his bag down .
“
Shh , ” Kenzie said .
The pair were walking away from the greater group .   
With all of the cars parking , even in the growing gloom , the car headlights illuminated the area .   
Tattletale and Snag stepped toward shadow , where they were out of earshot of most others .
“
You located him ?
”
“ I ’ve known where he was for a very long time , ” Tattletale answered Snag .
Love Lost was approaching .   
Snag turned his head to see .
The two communicated briefly , a word from Snag , Love Lost tapping the backs of her hands together twice , the metal there clinking .
As they had that exchange , Tattletale looked around idly , her eyes turning skyward .
Her eyes locked on the camera , looking directly at us .
“
Love Lost says- ”
“ Cradle ’s arrived .
”
“
Yes .   
He ’ll wait for the crowd to thin out before deploying .   
And you-
”
“
We ’ll deliver , ” she said .   
“
You ’ll get your fourth , I get each of you for three years .
”
“
That ’s fine , ” Snag said .








Sveta tugged my arm , dragging me off the train .   
The sky was dark and the lights of the city were at their deceptive stage where so few apartments and buildings were lit up that it looked like it was four in the morning , not seven in the evening .
“
Come on , ” she urged , tugging .
“
There ’s stuff to do before everything happens tomorrow , ” I said .   
“
I really want to , but plans .
”
“ Change your plans .   
You need to talk to the Wardens , right ?
”
“ I was planning on doing a write - up I can bring with .   
I sent an email before we got on the train
, I ’d have to get my computer or phone out to see if they responded already .
”
“
Come on .   
Talk to Weld .   
We ’ll work something out for the rest .
”
More to keep us from getting in other people
’s way , I let Sveta drag me out onto the train platform .   
We stood outside the train while people got on .   
I had only a minute to decide if I ’d do what I wanted to do , which was to go with Sveta , or if I ’d do what I needed to do , which was to prepare for an imminent war that too few people seemed to be aware of .
Lots of the people were staring or glancing at Sveta , with her unusual body .   
The noises that body made as she tugged at me drew as much attention as the colorful suit .
“
Let me check my phone ?
” I asked .   
“
It might change what I ’m doing .
”
“
Okay .
”
The connection was slow as I waited for my email to load , the diamond shape in the center of the blank page folding into itself endlessly in the ‘ loading’ loop .
I sighed a little as the train doors closed and the train went on its way .
“
Do n’t sigh at me , Victoria , ” Sveta said .   
“ The train does n’t matter .   
You can fly .
”
“
People make fun of you on the internet if you get caught on camera while browsing your phone or laptop while flying .   
I wanted to sit and chat with you about dumb , meaningless stuff-
”
“ Which we thoroughly did .
”
“
-and then spend the rest of the trip typing notes .
”
“ I used to admire that side of you .   
It was a good thing when you were doing the physio , and when you were watching those videos of university classes .   
Which were incredibly boring , I ’m sorry .
”
“ They were the highlight of my day .
”
“ They were so boring .   
I do n’t know how you make powers boring , but they managed .   
But you had the mental fortitude to push through it .
”
“ I enjoyed it , ” I said .   
“
Really .
”
“
But I ’m worried about that attitude now .   
If I had real hands I ’d reach up and feel your shoulders to see how tense you are .
”
I relaxed my shoulders as casually and naturally as possible .
“ If you ’re stiffer than the girl with the prosthetic body and her metal boyfriend , you need to relax .   
Spend some time with me and Weld .   
We ’ll talk about tomorrow .
”
“ I need to call Crystal first .
”
“
Invite her !
” Sveta said .   
She reached out and jostled my arm roughly .   
“ Bring her .   
Tristan was going to come by later with some stuff for me , when he has his turn again .   
He ’ll have updates .   
We can make it a little leadership meeting .
”
She looked so happy at the notion .
“ I ’ll ask if she ’s interested , ” I conceded .
“ I ’ll have to figure out what we ’ll eat , ” Sveta said , in an almost sing - song , happy way .
My phone finally loaded .   
I had messages and emails .   
I ignored them and sent one to Crystal .
Me : 

Sveta ’s trying to drag me to dinner with her and Weld .   
You want to come ?
“
I ’m not trying to drag you , ” Sveta said , as she set her chin down on my shoulder .
“
You were literally dragging me .
”
Best Cousin : 

yes !   
where ?   
what do I bring ?
“
Nothing , ” Sveta said .   
“
We ’ll have to order in .
”
Me : 

Blue binder from the coffee table .   
It has a magazine cutout taped to front .
“
That ’s not nothing , ” Sveta said .
Best Cousin : 

I meant food u dumbass
“
I like her , ” Sveta said .
“ People are feeling abusive today , ” I said .   
“
Something in the air .
”
I told Crystal not to bring food , then typed out the address as Sveta recited it .   
I left the message typed in the box .
“ Address is right .   
Hit send , ” Sveta said .
“
We ’ll compromise , ” I said .   
“
Because I have about a hundred things I ’ve been keeping in the back of my mind , and I had everything arranged in my head
so tonight would be the night I pulled it together .
”
“
What ’s the compromise ?
”
“ I need to get organized .   
If we ’re not getting some stuff done for tomorrow , I ’ll cut out a bit after dinner , and we ’ll do it another time .
”
“ Deal .   
I think you ’ll find we ’re better at balancing the cape stuff with the real stuff .   
In a way , it ’s all mixed up for us already .
”
“
Alright , ” I said .   
“
Yeah .
”
She hugged my arm .   
“ Send a message to Weld , too ?   
Let him know ?
” I did .
“
This way , ” she said .   
She walked with a bit of a bounce in her slightly ungainly step .   
I was n’t sure she would have been able to if she was n’t holding onto me .
Stratford station and the surrounding neighborhood were an area of the megalopolis I primarily knew for its airfield .   
Helicopters were in and out , and as someone who often had to fly past , I had to be mindful of the airspace .   
I usually flew low or gave it a wider berth , using the highway to the north as my guide .
Now that I was in the neighborhood and moving at a walking pace , I could see it was one of the quainter areas .   
It was one of the first areas to be settled , and the buildings were smaller , with more houses .   
Not too dissimilar to my mom
’s
neighborhood .   
Even the apartment buildings were three or four floors tall at the highest .   
Like many of the buildings in the early settlements , they ’d been built broad rather than tall .
My phone buzzed and I checked it .
I had two messages , excepting the six others I had from Kenzie .
The first was from the Wardens .   
They wanted to talk at ten thirty in the evening .   
Committee .   
Team heads would be there .
I showed Sveta .
“
Damn .   
We ca n’t spend that long together , ” she said .
“ We do have things to do .
”
“ I know , ” she said .
I sent a copy of the message with the time to the others .
The other was from Ashley :   
Dark Damsel Ashley : 

At my apartment with BoB henchmen to get my things and talk to landlord .   
Moving to apartment in BoB territory .   
Taking chance to send message while away from the c - voyants .
She ’d sent the message to everyone .
I reported , “ Ashley ’s moving into Cedar Point , which I ’m not sure I would have recommended , but she seems to know what she ’s doing .
”
“ She ’s doing fine , ” Sveta said .
“
She ’s doing exceptionally , when it comes to the acting .   
If that ’s acting .   
The way she ’s letting these people see where she lives and she ’s taking her stuff to Cedar Point , when it might be the site of some fighting ?   
Or infighting ?   
That ’s where I might have given her other advice .
”
“
The way she ’s unreservedly going forward might make it more believable .
” I nodded .   
“
She ’s in Stratford , is n’t she ?   
We could bump into her .
”
“ Other direction from the station , but
yeah .
”
“
Do you meet or anything ?   
It ’s hard to picture you guys together without the group .
”
“
We ’ve met a couple of times .   
Um .   
Mr. Armstrong came by twice , and he invited us all to lunch .
”
“
Weld ’s foster dad , kind of .
”
“
Kind of .   
And he looked after Ashley , once upon a time , when she was in custody , once , and making sure she had some of what she needed , when she was homeless .   
He ’s a big reason she ’s free now , instead of being an unofficial prisoner with a protective guard , like some of the people from the Birdcage and the S - class threats .
”
“
Yeah .   
You met for lunch ?
” Sveta smiled .   
“
It was a bit awkward ,
most of the time it was two or three of the four of us talking and the rest did n’t have anything to add .   
But I ’m glad we did it .   
There was one moment where we were talking about something , I forget what led up to it , but for most of that lunch we were all very aware of the difference between us , and Weld said something about how people stared .   
Ashley said she ’d trade places with me or Weld , because she would like to be monstrous , because it would simplify things and it would make it more natural to be intimidating .   
Nevermind that we ’d really rather not be called monsters .
”
“
Yeah .
”
“
And Weld said something about that , and Mr. Armstrong tried to clarify , but it was n’t getting through .   
I remember thinking of just how huge the gulf was between us , and then I tried to explain things too .   
I said how it was different from wearing a certain dress or acting a certain way , because you ca n’t take it off .   
You ca n’t get away from it .   
And that makes it something different .   
Any situation you do n’t have control over is automatically worse .
”
“
What was her response ?   
You said it was a moment .
”
“
It was really , really good .   
She understood and then all of us were talking for the first time that lunch .   
Weld , Ashley and I were all talking about very different things , pressure , differences , and the rest of the world feeling like something that presses in on us .   
But we were on the same wavelength , with Mr. Armstrong chiming in now and again to clarify or add a point .   
When the group started talking about wanting to make a team , I think that was one of the things that made it something
I could be really interested in , instead of something where I had to say ‘ yeah , that ’s cool , but what about Ashley?’ .
”
“ I can picture that scene .   
Was it what Armstrong wanted ?
”
“ I snuck a look at him , and he looked pleased as punch .   
That was the last time we all got together .   
I wonder if that moment was what he was going for , and he considers his work done now that it happened .
”
“ It ’s taken me a while to get that far with the group .   
I ’m not sure
I ’m
all the way there .
”
“ I ’ve had to deal with it too , realizing it ’s not all peaches and cream .
”
“ Peaches and-   
You mean peachy keen ?
”
“
Either , ” Sveta said .
She was giving me a cheeky look , probably because she knew I ’d react .   
I rolled my eyes .
“ Reality is a thing , ” Sveta said .   
“
Stuff ’s going on .
”
“
The honeymoon period is over , ” I said .
“
Yeah .   
It was n’t really a honeymoon .   
More like it was nice when it was an idea , but once we executed it , we had to deal with stuff .
” I nodded .
I double checked my phone , which was still in my hand , then pocketed it .
“
Was there another moment ?
” I asked .
“ I went over to her apartment once , before a session .   
Not long after the lunch thing .   
It ’s nice , she seems to save up to buy nicer things , but there are gaps .   
So she has a really , really nice black leather couch , a black glass coffee table , a nice television , and a piece of art on the wall that looks expensive …
and then for the rest of the room it ’s moving boxes to sit on and put stuff on .
”
“ I can sort of understand that .   
I do n’t think it ’s unique to her .   
When you first move out on your own , most of the time , I think you get other people ’s leftover stuff , or thrift store stuff .   
Everyone ’s getting started over anew now .
”
“
Yeah , ” Sveta said .   
She shrugged awkwardly , like it was a motion she had n’t practiced much .   
“
But she loved all the things she had , so much .   
There was something there .   
I could see the person she might have been , without powers , or the kid she was before powers .   
When I was defending her to you , in the first days we were with the group , that ’s what I thought of .
”
“
I like what she ’s been doing for the group .   
She ’s been honest with me , but I do n’t know if I ’ve seen that glimmer of light .
”
Maybe I had .   
When Ashley had seen Presley ’s responses on the train .
“
I do n’t know if I ’d call it light .
”
“ I do n’t either .   
But … I ’m imagining what you ’re saying .   
I ’ll keep it in mind .   
I ’ll keep an open mind .
”
“ Please , ” Sveta said .   
“
And we ’re almost there .   
The place might be a little messy , to warn you .
”
“ Crystal and I are two people crammed into an apartment with room for one person , I do n’t think it ’s a problem , ” I said .   
I withheld the part where Crystal was a bit of a pig .
The apartment building was one among many , in a building with a post office built into one corner of the ground floor .   
With the small post office taking up a quarter of the ground floor , the remaining three quarters were divided into two spaces , it seemed .   
The hallway was open - air , more tunnel than hall , and there were windows on both sides , looking into both the tunnel and a small , narrow yard .   
I could see children ’s toys in the yard .
Sveta went to the door , and fished for a key on a lanyard that she wore around her neck .
“ Ground floor .   
Convenient .
”
“
Yeah .   
Weld worries sometimes that if he was on an upstairs floor , if it was wooden floors , he ’d cause too much wear and tear and then plunge through .
”
Sveta opened the door .   
“
I ’m home .   
I brought Victoria .
”
“
Hey !
”   
Weld stepped into the kitchen .   
He wore a black t - shirt in a tougher material , jeans , and the same rugged sandals I ’d seen before .   
A set of headphones were hanging from his neck .
Sveta went straight to him , and he had to catch her so she would n’t crash into him .   
She kissed him , then planted another kiss on his cheek when he turned his focus to me , smiling .
“ Victoria .   
It ’s so great to see you .
”
“
Sorry to drop in , and I ’m also sorry
I ’ll be distracted tonight .   
I hope you do n’t mind if I get my laptop out at some point .   
We have stuff to coordinate and figure out .
”
“
That ’s fine .   
I ’d love to talk shop , ” he said .   
“
Things have been weird with my team lately .   
The gears of bureaucracy grind slowly .   
Just one thing .
”
“
One thing ?
”
“
Do n’t say sorry .   
I get enough of them from her .
”
“
Do n’t say that !
”
Sveta said , scandalized .
“
Three unnecessary apologies before breakfast , another two after breakfast , before she ’s out the front door .   
At least one in a text message .
”
“
I ’m not that bad .
”
Weld smiled , then planted a kiss on the side of her head .
“
Do n’t try to mollify me or distract me .   
Not while we have company , ” Sveta said .   
She pointed at me .   
“
She needs to unwind .   
I thought we could do that and still hammer out the essentials .
”
“
We ’ll try , ” Weld said .
“ Make yourself at home , ” Sveta said .   
“
I ’m going to go rinse off .   
I ’ve been cooped up in this body
and I ’m all waxy and gross inside here .   
I ’ll be back out in a minute .
”
“
Do you want me to take your body ?
” Weld asked .
“
I ’m
okay .   
I ’ll bring a change of clothes in with me .
”
Sveta broke away from him and half - crashed - into , half - hugged me .   
Clearly happy , she went off to do her thing , leaving Weld and I.
“ Make yourself comfortable .   
I ’d offer food and drink , but I ’m not sure what we have .   
I do n’t usually partake- ”
Weld paused as Sveta closed the bathroom door .
“ -unless
she ’s inflicting an experiment on me .
”
“ I heard that , ” Sveta said , opening the door , before shutting it again .
The apartment was n’t what I would have called ‘ messy’ .   
In a way , it was very different from Crystal ’s place .   
There was no detritus , nothing left lying around .
Drawers had flat , painted metal faces , with no handles .   
Furniture was divided into things with no legs with what looked like it might have been stone framing the edges , and Sveta ’s favored grappling structures , which were poles extending from floor to ceiling with various platforms and things to hold on to .   
Even the walls had metal bracing at the corners , painted over so Weld would n’t stick to them .
“
Case fifty - three living ,
” Weld said .
“
She said it was messy .   
I do n’t see it .
”
“
Then I did a good job with my last - minute sweep and clean up , ” Weld said .   
“ Living room ?
”
I let him lead me to the living room .   
I put my bag down by the coffee table and sat down on the couch , which looked homemade to withstand someone who weighed a few hundred pounds sitting on it .   
It was so firm
I nearly bounced off of it while sitting down .   
Once I set my weight down , though , it gradually eased up , hissing as it adjusted to my weight .
Leaning forward , I looked outside into the yard .   
A toy plane was parked on the lawn , the kind a kid could sit in and push with their feet .
“
Did Sveta tell you what ’s going on ?
” I asked .
“
Some .   
I had trouble following who was who , sometimes , but I got the gist of it .
”
“
There ’s an attack planned on the Fallen tomorrow .   
One of our … not sure how to put it , or how much you know .   
Our contact , they ’re at risk .   
There are innocents there , and I ’m not sure the villains care about sparing them .
”
“ How can I help ?
”
Weld asked .
I adjusted my bag at my shoulder , to indicate , and said , “ I ’ve got a report partially written up .   
If you could glance over it , let me know what you think ?   
You know the Wardens and what their mindset is .
”
“
Sure .
”
“ I wanted to do some stuff with my costume later , but that might have to wait .   
It ’d be nice to finalize some costume things when I get back to my place , but timing is getting tighter , since it ’s already … seven thirty , and we have to get halfway across the city for ten thirty .
”
“
My offer stands , you know , ” Weld said .
“ Offer ?
”
“
To help with any of the metalwork , when you get a new costume .
”
It took me a second to connect the thought .
“
What the hell , Weld ?   
That was years ago , when I was thinking about rebranding and joining the Brockton Bay Wards .
”
“
It stands , ”
Weld said , smiling .
I paused .   
“
You ’re sure ?   
I have stuff at my apartment .
”
“
I ’m sure .
”
“
Thank you , ” I said .   
I fired off a quick series of texts to Crystal .
Me : 

Have you left yet ?
Best Cousin : 

i ’m on my way out the door .
promise Me : 

If it ’s not too heavy to carry , can you bring the black shopping bag with the yellow leaf on it from under that table ?
“
Thank you , ”
I said , as I finished .
“
You ’re worried about this , ” Weld said .   
“ Sveta said you were tense .   
It ’s bad ?
”
“
It ’s the Fallen , which are n’t great , and it ’s a lot of villains who are pretty desperate for relevance .   
We ’ve got to pitch this to the Wardens , I think we need more hands on deck , and from the murmurings I ’ve heard , there are n’t many to go around .
”
“
There are some , ” Weld said .   
“
Advance Guard is on standby , others are out of rotation .
”
“
Advance Guard is … a thing , ” I said .   
“
We ran into them earlier .   
I ’m not sure they ’d cooperate unless made to .
”
“ You might run into trouble getting anyone to cooperate .   
If they are n’t occupied , they ’re officially on standby .   
Their instinct is going to be to be ready and available in case something bigger happens .
”
“
Then I ’d want to frame it in a way that would justify bringing these people out of standby ?
”
“
Yep .   
Show me what you have ?
” he asked .
I pulled out my laptop , setting it on the coffee table , which was three planks set atop six planks , set firmly in place with metal bands around the perimeter .   
I wondered if it was built to be easily remade or rebuilt if it got broken .
The planks had been painted in what I recognized as Sveta ’s style .   
Clear , bold outlines , almost like a paint - by - numbers picture , or a stained glass picture , but the colors that filled each space were rich , varied , and multi - textured .   
Blue that became green , or shaded red , or mottled orange .
Weld sat down next to me .   
I opened the document and showed him .
Three sub - factions in Cedar Point .   
I ’d outlined the people in brief , with them named in more detail at the appendix , pulling out old records , files , articles and more to depict them in as much detail as I could without getting too lost in the exact facts .   
I ’d put down their motivations , whether it was money or personal , I had notes on their adherence to the rules , real and unwritten , and I ’d outlined other things about their behavior and patterns .
“
The problem with some of this is it does n’t leave the immediate impression that this is something that multiple hero groups are going to want to step into , ” Weld said .   
“
It ’s deep knowledge that someone going into the fight would love , the geeks will love it , but it ’s not something that ’s going to get people into the fight , if they are n’t already convinced .
”
“
Yeah .   
It ’s too dry .   
I ’m thinking the notes on petty crimes are distracting from the gravity of the situation .
”
“
Yeah .
”
“ Instead of an introduction to the parties involved , I could open with a presentation on the scenario , frontload it with words like war .
”
“
Not war , ” Weld said .   
“
That ’s going to remind people that there ’s something bigger on the horizon that we need to be ready for .
”
Bigger .   
We had a group with a dozen capes and we had another forty or more capes from Cedar Point going on the offensive .
“
Of course .   
Maybe … potential loss of civilian life , fallout , and provoking a retaliative back - and - forth that extends across the city at a time when resources are already tested .   
Something that you do n’t want happening behind you while you ’re facing a war in front of you .
”
“
Sounds like you have the right idea .
”
“ Weld ? ”
Sveta called out .
“ Be right back .
”
I worked on the document while Weld joined Sveta in the washroom .   
Title page written , the size of confrontation outlined , and the ramifications made clear .
I was writing it to try to convince a group of seasoned heroes and the people who managed them .   
It felt convincing , because I was feeling nervous , getting into everything that was involved .
The last time I ’d been in something of this scale , I ’d been spit on by a mutant the size of a truck .   
I ’d had most of my flesh melted off and necrotized , and I ’d been left vulnerable and helpless .
At that point in time , with the pain being as bad as it was , my emotions all over the map as I thought one thing and felt another , I ’d been ready to die .   
I had n’t done nearly enough , but I ’d fought and I was ready for it to be over .   
The chance at living had n’t been worth the risk of being healed .
Tattletale had lied to me , and had forced Amy on me .   
She had some small responsibility for everything that followed .
So easy , in moments like this , for there to be a point of weakness .   
Letting my guard down could do so much damage .
I left the document like it was , so there was room for more revisions before polish .   
I checked my messages .
Eighteen total messages from Kenzie .   
Photos of the body part of her costume in progress , some more stream - of - consciousness , she let me know when she was going to dinner , then when she came back .   
Pizza , apparently .   
She ’d wanted to have her hands free to focus .   
She also wanted to know what to bring .
Which raised a question about what our exact role would be in things as they happened .   
Our priorities .
I put that aside .   
It was for the group to discuss .
Tristan .   
Last I ’d heard , he was talking to the lawyer .
Tristan the Goat : 
 waiting for legal advisor nat now . 

am not optimistic but got video footage from Ls as you recommended . 

ugh .   
if nat keeps me waiting any longer I ’ll have to switch for byron . 

going to svetas later btw .
will update properly around then .
I sent him a message to let him know
I ’d be at Sveta ’s place .
Tristan had been frustrated by Natalie earlier , but we ’d try this , because I ’d had a small amount of luck after giving her something more tangible to work with than my reports .   
We ’d try bouncing people off Natalie until we found one that worked .   
If any one member of the group ended up being good at working with Natalie , we ’d keep them in that role as legal liaison .   
If Natalie could n’t be worked with , we would find someone else .
An email from Byron , twenty minutes after that .
Byron the Blue : 
 rain left a voice message for me and Tristan .   
sounded rushed .   
he is n’t staying at his place tonight .   
he might go back tomorrow but sounded weird .   
specifically said he was messaging us to drop details so we would have lead if something happened to him .   
ominous .
More details to come .   
Will send you the voice message when I get home to computer and figure out how Concerning .   
A message from Presley , sent via Email and translated to a text : Presley from the Train : 

Can u ask ur friend from the train how she gets her hair
so white ?
It put a slight smile on my face , when everything else felt so heavy .   
I made a mental note to ask .
There was also a group text discussion too long for me to search through , mostly Kenzie and Chris , where Chris was asking what forms we needed for him for tomorrow .   
I scrolled down to the bottom , at which point Tristan was no longer participating .
Creepy Kid : 
 Blind rage would be a mistake I think .   
Sudden Shock is quick
… 

…
Or Keen Vigilance .   
Slow but tough … 

…
and I ’d be able to see and hear most of what was going on .
Heart Shaped Pupil : 

Is that the one with all the eyes ?
Creepy Kid : 

That ’s Multifaceted Interest .   
You call yourself a good student ?
Heart Shaped Pupil : 

I am a good student .   
Interest and vigilance are the same for you .
Creepy Kid : 

Same range of the spectrum as Vigilance but diff’t .
Is open and loose … 

… You have n’t seen Vigilance .
Same thing but focused more and pulled together tight … 

…
Think armadillo with ears like a fennec fox and bigger eyes … 

… and claws because its keen Heart Shaped Pupil : 
 Awww Creepy Kid : 
 Very not aww .
Ugh .
I added my own thought to the text conversation .
Victoria : 

We want you on sidelines .   
Fast would be good .   
Rescue , evacuate civilians Heart Shaped Pupil : 
 Vicotria ! ! ! 

Victoria ! 

How are you ?   
Excited ?
Creepy Kid : 

I can make that one form .   
But I want to get my hands dirty too .
Hands dirty ?   
I paused , thinking about that .   
Looking back at the conversation , I skimmed things .   
Chris had contributed more than half of the conversation , going into detail , ideas , plans .
I had never seen him quite this engaged .   
Was it because he was more comfortable online than in person ?   
Or was it because he wanted to get his hands dirty , as he put it ?
Victoria : 

Why ?
Creepy Kid : 

_
This _ is why I ’m doing this hero team thing … 

… I missed the visit to the Warden HQ because I was n’t at the computer
… 

… which was my fault .
I need to be a part of this .
I did n’t reply immediately , instead sitting back , thinking about things , while Kenzie responded , sharing some of the same image she had already sent me as part of the chat .
Chris wanted to be a part of this , and the visit to the Warden HQ .   
He wanted to be part of the big things ?   
The large events ?   
But he did n’t care about the rest ?   
Were the big events tied to big emotions ?
I could n’t understand him .
A knock on the front door got my attention .   
Weld stepped out of the bathroom , towel at one of his hands , and let Crystal in .   
She had the binder and the bag .   
She was wearing her bodysuit with a jacket and jeans .   
The ‘ Laserdream’ logo on the front , an arrow with a series of lines flowing behind it at a diagonal .
“
This is so damn heavy , Victoria ” she said .
“ If it was too heavy you should have left it , ” I said .   
I hurried across the living room and down the hallway to reach her , relieving her of the bag .
Greetings went around .   
Sveta stepped out of the washroom , wearing her body again , with a sweatshirt and sweatpants on .   
Her makeup had been washed off , and the tattoo was clearly visible on her cheekbone .   
She gave Crystal a hug .
“
They ’re preparing for a crisis , ” Weld said .
“ I know , ” Crystal said .   
“
Believe me , I know .
”
We moved to the living room .   
I set the black cloth shopping bag down , and fished inside .
“
What ’s in this bag ?
” Crystal asked .
I pulled out some of the costume materials .
There were four ways to go with a costume .   
The first was to make it yourself .   
It leaned heavily on one ’s own ability , and I was n’t sure I had the ability to keep everything trim while also giving it a unique cut .   
The second way was to buy it , but that had problems , and a lot of the places and people that offered costume making services had a way of injecting their own tastes into things , so one of their clients often resembled another .   
The third way was to have someone else handle that for you , working for the like of the Wards or Wardens and leaving it up to the Branding department .   
Not an option for me .
The fourth was to mix and match .   
I ’d take a small shortcut .   
I ’d bought black and white versions of the same hooded top , picked for the slanted cut around the collar , shoulders , and the more sleeves .   
I could cut one up and use it to apply trim to the other and know the cut would match .   
Then I ’d apply the additional elements that would make it a costume .
“ I was going to do some sewing to keep my hands busy while I read up on things , but plans changed .
”
“
Cloth is n’t that heavy .   
What else is that , that makes it so heavy ?
”
Crystal asked .
“
Spare stuff from dad , ” I said .   
I pulled out some equipment .   
It was the right kind of material , all in a matte gunmetal , but the texture was all wrong .   
Dad was ‘ Flashbang’ and the armor panels , mask , straps , and guards were all in the style of a grooved grenade exterior .   
I ’d always thought it was a dumb theme when most flashbangs were smooth - exterior canisters .   
“
I was thinking I could maybe get you to trim it , Crystal .   
Sear off the knobby bits and leave just the panel of armor .   
I have n’t quite worked the process out .
”
“ I can do that .   
What look do you want ?
”
Weld asked .
I grabbed the binder , and began flipping through it .   
Costume notes and ideas .
“
There are years of geeking out in that binder , for the record , ” Crystal said .
Sveta collapsed into the seat next to me , looking at the art I ’d picked out for reference and ideas .
I found pages , opened the binder to retrieve them , and then closed it so I could fish for more .
“
Hood , layered long sleeves I can remove as needed for weather .   
Fingerless gloves with decoration .   
Metal decoration at the front and edges of the hood … like this image here .   
Spikes , like my old tiara , but at the shoulder , decorating edges of the hood , and at the breastplate … which would be structured on a basic level , just like this image .
”
The breastplate was flat , with only a slight curve to deflect blows .   
A matching , briefer plate rested against the collarbone and upper breast , the bottom part overlapping and sticking up slightly .
“
A bit of a warrior angel , ” Weld said , turning one picture around so it was right - side - up for him .
“ Without the wings .   
Yeah , maybe , ” I said .
“ Sweetie , no , ” Crystal said .   
“
You ’re one of the very few capes who can get away with a breastplate that shows off the assets , because you have the forcefield .   
You do n’t want to be pervy about it , because that ’s a whole different kind of cape , but a costume should make more of what you are .
”
I rolled my eyes at her .
“
It would be utterly criminal if I let you do that , ” she said .
I shook my head .   
“
If any kids end up looking up to me , or if any became heroes , I do n’t want them thinking that kind of armor is okay .   
It ’s asking to get hurt .
”
“
It ’s still way better than a bodysuit , and we ’ve been wearing those for years , ” Crystal said .
“ I like the idea of armor .   
I intend to get up close and personal , and my defenses wo n’t always be up .
”
“ I know that , ” Crystal said .   
“
I can see it .   
But you should n’t hide in your costume .   
It should n’t bury you .   
I said the same to-
I ’ve said it often enough before .
”
She ’d said the same to Amy .
I had n’t missed the fact that Amy had worn a hood as part of her costume .
Maybe I ’d go with black cloth , applying the white trim , rather than the inverse .
“ I think Victoria should dress the way she wants , ” Sveta said .
“
So do I , ” Crystal said .   
“
But I also think sometimes friends and family need to steer you a bit .
”
“ I do n’t see it as hiding , ” I said .   
“
That ’s not the reasoning or logic .   
I want the costume to have weight , while still being form - fitting at the torso and arms .   
Layers , armor , the hood .   
Breaking from the norm is important , because it makes an impact .   
Most of the time , you see a cape in a hood , and you naturally glance beneath , and there ’s a gimmick keeping the face beneath from being seen .   
Another mask , or power - generated shadow , or something else .   
They ’ll just see me .   
Glaring or smiling , but it could have more impact when they do .
”
“ No mask ?
” Crystal asked .
“ I thought about it .   
I might have one for protective reasons , for intense situations or cold weather , but
…
it ’s not me .
”
“
Okay , ” she said .
“ Spikes , ” Weld said .   
“
You want me to do those ?   
And the breastplate ?
”
“ I do n’t have a breastplate , ” I said .   
“ Just the extra pads .
”
“ I can blend them into each other .   
The shiny coating will be pretty thin , though .   
I have stuff of my own .
”
“ Please , ” I said .   
“
That ’d be amazing .
”
Sveta bumped her shoulder into mine .   
“ See ?   
Seee ?   
It was so good you came .
”
“
You sound more like Kenzie than yourself right now .
”
“
This is good .   
People !   
We collaborate .
”
“ I need more information on the spikes before I do the rough shape , ” Weld said .   
“
You made notes on this .   
Five spikes at the shoulder , uneven ?
”
“ Rays more than spikes , ” I said .   
“
They space out , four , and then one shorter .   
Minor gap between the four and one .
”
“
Any reason for the short one ?
” Weld asked .
“ Symmetry , ” I said .   
“
It curves in ,
so it ’s more toward the front of the shoulder , and it leads into more of the same at the breastplate decoration .
”
“ Hmmm .
”
“
No ?
” I asked .
“
Hhm .   
I ’ll trust your instincts , ” he said .   
“
I can work faster if I heat the metal up .   
I ’m going to go set up the forge .
”
“ Why barbecue when you can use lasers ?
” Crystal asked .   
“
Lasers are great .   
We can collab and gossip like schoolgirls while these two work out their business .
”
“
My schoolgirl impression leaves a lot to be desired , ” Weld said .
Crystal grinned .   
“
But barbecue sounds good , while we ’re on the subject .   
I was tempted here with food and promises of a chance to tease my cousin .
”
“
Ah , right .   
I tend to forget , because I do n’t eat much , ” Weld said .
“ Wait , wait , wait .   
Promises of what ?
” I asked .
“
Implied promises , at least , ” she said .
“ I can order in , ” Sveta said .   
“
We can do the teasing later .
”
“ You guys laugh , but I can fire back just as hard .
”
“ I look forward to it , ” Crystal said .
They headed over to the door that led out into the backyard and the brick patio , collecting a few of the components , and paused at the door .
A kid , about five or six , was at the glass door .   
His mouth was pressed to the glass and he was exhaling , so his cheeks puffed out and the inside of his mouth was in plain view .
“
He ’s one of the kids from next door , ” Sveta said .   
“
We do n’t use the backyard much , since Weld tears it up and I have a harder time walking on grass .   
Sometimes they say hi .
”
“ Open sesame !
”
Weld called out .
The kid hurried to obey .   
He milled around Weld and Crystal as they got themselves organized outside .   
Crystal set up a forcefield to keep the kid at bay while starting to heat up the metal .   
The kid seemed fascinated by the field .
Sveta and I remained on the couch , watching Weld , Crystal , and the kid through the glass .
“
It ’s nice , having the kids around , ” Sveta said .   
“ Annoying sometimes , but mostly nice .
”
“
Yeah .   
Do you do much with them ?
”
“
We babysit .   
I have art in my room that I got from them .   
I gave them some back .   
I think it ’s important .   
Reaching out , having that human connection , having people have good experiences with us .
”
“
Absolutely , ” I said .
“
Five spikes , one shorter and set apart .   
Is it a hand ?
” Sveta asked .   
Her voice was quiet .   
For me alone .   
“
A dangerous hand ?
”
“
Yeah , a bit , ” I said .   
“
A bit of the sun , glory , crown of the statue of liberty motif .   
But the hands are-
yeah .
”
“
Why ?
”
“
Because sooner or later , people are going to find out about the w- about my forcefield .   
It might be a certain power interaction , it might be dust in the air or rain streaming down it .   
Maybe a person looks through a tinker lens and sees it .   
I ’ll make my uneasy peace with it first .   
I want to own that side of myself , at least a little , before that happens .
”
“
What were you about to call it , before you stopped yourself ?
” I hesitated .   
“ The wretch .
”
“
Is it ?   
A wretch ?   
It ’s strong , is n’t it ?   
I was thinking about it , and how you carried Kenzie ’s box .   
You used straps .
”
“
More about where it comes from than what it is , ” I said .
“
Mine is anxiety and instinct , ” Sveta said .   
“ If you ever want , I can tell you some things that Mrs. Yamada taught me .   
But try to figure out what it ’s doing first , then figure out how to work around it .
”
“ Thanks , ” I said .   
Looking for a bit of an escape or out , I reached out for the binder , and shifted its position on the table .
“
Owning it sounds like a good start .   
That ’s the last I ’ll say until you ask .   
Now , tell me , do you have anything in here to help inspire my costume ?
”
“
I have so much in here for your costume , ” I said , smiling at least in part due to my relief that that conversation was over .
⊙ Sveta and Weld ’s place had been tidy before , but it was something else by the time the next knock on the door came .   
Costume pieces , straps , cut cloth , paper bowls of clearly recycled paper with inauthentic Chinese food within , metal , costume notes , and two laptops .
Weld had put his music on .   
He had an eclectic taste , and the current song was , as close as I could place it , rock with one of the two vocalists using throat singing .
Tristan entered , carrying his bag over one shoulder .   
Natalie followed him in .
“
Who ’s this ?
”
Crystal asked me .
“ Natalie , the paralegal , and Tristan , the teammate .
”
“ I like Tristan
’s choice in colors , ” Crystal said .
I did n’t get a chance to respond , because Tristan and Natalie joined us in the living room .
“ Crystal .   
We did n’t meet , ” Tristan said .   
“ I was watching on camera while you visited Cedar Point .
”
“
I love the hair , ” Crystal said .   
“
I like the color , too .   
I have a soft spot for boys who are brave enough to dye their hair .   
If only you were a bit older .
”
“ I ’m flattered , ” Tristan said .   
“
Those are n’t the boys I tend to go after , myself , but my dating life is n’t very … alive , either .
”
“
Ah , is that so ?
”
Crystal asked .   
“
Here , come sit .   
I think there ’s a clear space somewhere here .
”
“ Costume stuff , apparently .   
And we ’ve got the munchkins on the screen , ” Tristan observed .   
He bent down and waved for the camera that was built into the corner of the laptop .   
A tiny Kenzie waved back .   
Chris existed only in text .
“
And this is Natalie , ”
I introduced Natalie .   
I was n’t wholly sure why she was here , but Tristan had wanted to invite her , and I was n’t about to object if he was trying another way to get her more onboard .   
“
Mom recommended her .   
Natalie , this is Crystal , my cousin .
”
“
Pleasure , ” Crystal said , half - standing to extend a hand .
Natalie shook it and gave Crystal a tight smile back .   
Crystal gave me a momentary glance as she sat back down .
“
I ’m
sorry
we ’re such a mess
right now , ” Sveta said .   
“
The apartment is usually nicer .
”
“ I totally understand , ” Natalie said .   
“ Do n’t worry .
”
“ Food , ” Weld said .   
“ Help yourself , please .   
Sveta does n’t eat much and it ’ll go to waste otherwise .   
I think we kept track of the ones I ate from and put them away .
”
“ Why does it matter ?
” Tristan asked .
“ I do n’t have much sense of smell or taste .   
We ’ve been exploring , and we ’re getting further afield , trying things that are not so good for flesh and blood .
”
“
We started with capsaicin and citric acid concentrate , ” Sveta said .
“ Among other things , ” Weld said .
“
We ’ll find something , ” Sveta said .
“ Hoping so .   
If it tastes funny , do n’t keep eating it , ” Weld said .   
“
I think we removed all of the dishes I tried .
”
“ I ’ll pass , thank you , ” Natalie said .
Tristan sat down on the floor next to Crystal , grabbing a spare bowl , before portioning out contents .
“
Any more word from our absentee ?
” I asked .
“
Nothing except a string of seemingly random words left in case he disappears for good .   
It ’s cryptic enough it would take some trying to find him , which I think is what he intends .
”
“
It might be a good thing , ” Crystal said .   
“
If they ’re after him .
”
“
Tactically ?   
Yes .   
But he ’s a friend .   
He told me almost everything , ” Tristan said .   
“ Not this .
”
I looked at the screen of the computer .   
Rapping my fingers against the edge of the laptop twice , I said , “ C says it ’s unusual for our missing member to use something that cryptic .   
He ’s not wrong .
”
“
There ’s a lot of unusual happening with him lately , I do n’t know what conclusions to draw from that , ” Tristan said .   
“
He gives himself a hard time because he does n’t realize that he has a lot of inner strength and a lot of general talents the rest of us do n’t have .   
I think he ’s capable enough to come out of this intact , barring the worst case scenarios .
”
“ I worry about the people around him , too , ” I said .
“ I do too , ” Sveta said .   
She held out her arm while Weld checked the fit of a different arm encasement .   
His finger drawn to a point , he raked it along the metal to mark a part that needed fixing .
“
We ’ll figure this out , ” Tristan said .
“ How did the talk go ?
”
I asked , looking between Tristan and Natalie .
“ Natalie and I covered the events of the day , ” Tristan said .   
“
Byron is loaning me time
so I can do more .   
He ’ll help some tomorrow too .   
He ’s not up for the hero thing , but this is serious enough that he ’s on board .   
We ’re a little more divided on tomorrow .
”
“
Thank you , Byron , ” I said .   
“
As for tomorrow , Natalie , maybe you could take a look at the proposal for the Wardens ?
”
I turned my laptop around for her .   
She took a seat on the ground to read it , no longer standing and hovering around like she did n’t know what to do with herself .
On the screen of Sveta ’s laptop , Kenzie was elbow - deep in electronics , unable to type .   
No recent messages from Chris .
Just about everyone had their costumes ready .   
Kenzie was going to equip Chris with some projectors .
“
Two major groups of capes , ” I said .   
“
The Fallen are n’t to be messed with .   
They were a minor nuisance for years , with some bad stuff going on in the background , with kidnappings , murders , mutilations of minorities , case fifty - threes included , and a lot of low - level terrorist or attention - grabbing stunts .   
The group we ’re focusing on now , I believe , are the Mathers .   
Each of the major branches took an Endbringer as a theme , and the Mathers took the Simurgh .
”
“
The kidnappings were their thing , ” Weld said .   
“
Back in Bet , they would go after isolated capes , ages sixteen to twenty - five .   
These capes would be married into the family .   
Thirteen incidents over seven years .   
Three of the kidnapping victims stayed .   
Three died .   
The rest escaped , were released , or were freed by PRT intervention .   
The PRT tried to go after them , but they moved frequently and they had anti - thinker measures in place .
”
“
It stands to reason they still have them , ” I said .   
Because Rain had been hiding among them .
“ Stands to reason , ” Tristan said .   
“ Looksee , that means you keep cameras off of the Fallen , unless we give the all clear .   
We do n’t know if it goes through cameras , and your cameras are weird enough it might be more dangerous .
”
Kenzie took her hands off of her work to type .   
Protests , it seemed .
“ We ’ll present our situation to the Wardens and we ’ll do what we can to get them on board .   
Whether we get them or not , we ’ll have some priorities , small scale and big ,    and they ’ll be what we default to if we ’re caught in the moment .
”
“
May I ?
”
Tristan asked , scooting over and shifting the laptop so it was at a middle ground where both he and Natalie could read it .   
Natalie gave him an annoyed look .   
“
You wrote them down .   
Good .
” I leaned forward .   
“
This attack on the Fallen ?   
It ’s villains looking for validation and a chance to show their stuff , and a lot of natural and justified hate for the Fallen .   
They ’re an acceptable target , and the Hollow Point group wants to show they ’re a force unto themselves .   
Part of the group will be going after our teammate , unfortunately , and we ca n’t control that directly .   
But he ’s not the focus of the larger group .
”
“
We ’ll trust him , that he knows what he ’s doing , if he ’s hiding , ” Tristan said .
“ We have to , your buddy Chris says , ” Crystal said .
“ I was gracefully avoiding mentioning that , Chris , ” Tristan said .
I went on , “
Depending on how the scenario unfolds , we may need to evacuate bystanders .   
The Hollow Point group is attacking the compound .   
They arrived in cars , they had low - tier members out gassing up the cars for a trip , so we can assume they ’ll drive and they ’ll arrive at the compound , taking action from there .   
They ’ll probably split up , with teams that know each other sticking together .
”
“ Factions within the group , ” Sveta said .   
“
Already some infighting .
”
“ Yep .     
I emailed people my last draft of the document .   
It covers the groups to expect .   
Read it tonight or early tomorrow .   
In a big engagement , we ca n’t just throw ourselves into the skirmish and hope things will resolve themselves , ” I said .   
“ Tristan is more comfortable managing the group in the heat of the fight , I think .   
I can give a bird ’s eye view , and I ’ll communicate what I can .   
If I ca n’t solve an emerging problem myself , I ’ll try to give direction to those who can .
”
“ Are the younger members of the group participating ?
” Natalie asked .
“ Not directly , ” I said .   
“
We talked about it .   
We ’ll do the same as we did in Cedar Point yesterday .   
Looksee as toolbox , if she participates it ’ll be as a projection , and we ’ll keep her removed from the Fallen .   
She focuses more on the Hollow Point group .   
C runs interference .
”
“ Text from Looksee , ” Crystal reported .   
“
She says her mom can drop her off with her projector .   
That ’s an adorable image , a cape being dropped off by a parent .
”
“
Not so adorable , ” Tristan said .
“
She wants to know if you can carry her projector in .
”
“
You ’re the one carrying it ,
” Tristan said , to me .
“
Not in , ” I said .   
“
We ’ll bring it and keep it near our retreat , so we have a point to fall back to . ”
“
Alright .   
What does Looksee think ?
”
“
She says that ’s fine , ” Crystal said .
“ The focus in big engagements is to identify the points we can change , and act on them , ” I said .   
“
Rescue and civilians will be a continuous one .
”
Natalie moved the laptop , turning it toward Tristan .
“ You ’re done ?
” I asked .
“ I read it .   
I did n’t get into the list of capes , but I read about the ones in charge .
”
“
And ?
”
“ I think the justifications for getting involved are sound .   
That depends on what the Wardens say , mind you .   
If they do n’t agree , I do n’t agree either .   
It does seem to me , however , that it seems like the kind of thing where heroes are very badly needed .   
I hope you get their help .
”
“
Thank you , ” I said .
“ I do n’t think the younger members of the group should be involved .
”
“ Looksee will be more or less remote , ” Tristan said .   
“
Creepy kid will be venturing in only when we give the a - ok . ”
“
As …
Sudden Shock and Deep Reflection ?
”
“ I guess , ” Tristan said .
“ If the Youth Guard were active , they ’d say no , ” Natalie said .
“
Can you mute the laptop so they do n’t hear ?
” Tristan asked .
Crystal covered the microphone on the laptop with her hand .
“ Natalie , ” Tristan said .   
“ If they Youth Guard were active , they ’d say no , and the kids would get involved anyway .   
That was a thing that happened in my experience .
”
“
Oh man , my brother and I gave everyone headaches , ” Crystal said .   
“ Our grades dropped and our parents were told we had to give up the costumes for a few months until we pulled them back up .   
Our parents , the Youth Guard , even the PRT was asked to keep an eye out for us .   
We were scoundrels .
”
“
Right ? ”
Tristan asked .
Crystal took her hand away from the microphone .   
Both Chris and Kenzie were protesting at length about being deafened for that segment of conversation , with lines of chat appearing so fast they were hard to read .   
Kenzie seemed to mostly enjoy joining her voice to Chris’ .
“ I ’ve given my advice .
”
“
They ’re members of the team , ” Sveta said .   
“
We ’ll keep them safe .
”
Natalie pursed her lips but did n’t say anything .
“
Let ’s talk about major objectives , ” I said .   
“
On the small scale , we help the civilians .   
Pulling away from that , there are a few worst case scenarios here .
”
⊙ “ Major objectives , ” I said .   
“ Containment , control , resolution .
”
It was late , and the light from the windows were dark .   
The administration in charge of the Wardens were sitting at the tables in front of us , to our left , and to our right .   
Chevalier and Valkyrie were present , sitting directly in front of me .   
Legend ’s seat was empty .   
I saw the name plate for Chief Armstrong , white haired with a very pronounced chin and a crooked nose .   
He looked more like a mad scientist or a quirky grandfather than a major figure in the cape scene .
Some of them had laptops or tablets .   
Chevalier was one of them .   
He ’d taken off his gold and silver helmet and wore a cloth mask beneath .   
Not his serious armor set .   
Valkyrie was in full costume , helmet on , and had no technology .   
She did have a a specter standing just behind her right shoulder .   
A man with a hazy silhouette .
I wore my costume .   
The white decorative    trim on the black fabric was missing , and I planned more ornamentation for my gloves , but the rest was intact .   
Spires of gold like my old tiara stood up at my shoulders , the middle - center of my breastplate , and decorated the armor around my legs and on my gloves .   
The decoration at my forehead was a weight that kept my hood down , and my hair draped out over my right shoulder .   
A protective mask hung from my belt , the curved surface resting around the curve of my thigh .   
I ’d don it if there was danger , and if I did n’t need to speak .
The costume had a weight to it .   
It felt almost right .
“
Talk to me about containment , ” Chevalier said .
“ The worst case scenarios here are that this becomes a problem for the city , ”
I said .   
“
If the Fallen lose but are n’t wiped out , precedent suggests they ’ll hit back harder .   
We could expect guerilla tactics throughout the city , terror attacks , and a hit against Cedar Point in particular .
”
“ The area that has been colloquially named Hollow Point , ” a woman said .
“
Yes , ma’am , ” Capricorn answered .
“ We ’ll be operating from the perimeter , because getting into the thick of the situation would be beyond our abilities .   
Part of our aim will be to keep Fallen from splintering away to regroup and lash out .   
We ’ll have a tinker trap waiting on the main road out of the area , and we ’ll have eyes on the logging roads .
”
“
Does this perimeter extend to containing the villains of Hollow Point ?
”
a man in a suit asked .   
“ If they rush in … does this tinker trap trap them there ?
” I looked to my left , where Capricorn stood in his armor , then to my right , where Sveta was .   
She ’d donned some decorative additions .   
As I wore spikes that echoed the wretch ’s hands , Sveta wore armor that curved and curled away .
Kenzie was workshopping and had an earlier bedtime .   
Chris had wanted to come , but we had n’t been able to get him in costume , and having him around and uncostumed was n’t a good look when we wanted to present our best face .
He ’d been a little upset .
“
We debated that , ” Capricorn ventured .   
“
Our instinct is that Cedar Point ’s villains would get desperate , if they were trapped on hostile territory .   
That would risk civilian well being .   
The trap is a soft deterrent more than anything else .   
We think we ’d let them go rather than try to force it , but we decided we ’d leave it up to you , should the Wardens decide to get involved .
”
“
Then we will get back to you with our thoughts , should we decide to get involved , ” the man said .   
Tristan ducked his head in acknowledgement .
“ Control , ” Chevalier said .
“
The document we sent you outlines a few priority targets to watch out for .   
In the old days , their wiki pages would have had warnings .   
Our focus is more on Cedar Point than on the Fallen , because we have an incomplete picture of the latter .   
These people are more likely to hurt civilians , and they ’re likely to escalate the situation .   
If we can target them and remove them from the picture , we will .   
We have a contact keeping an eye on them already .
”
“ We could supply what we have on this group of the Fallen , ” Chevalier said .   
“
Whether or not we get involved , I think we lose very little by rounding out your knowledge there .
”
He checked with others , and got nods of affirmation .
I felt my heart skip a beat .   
Whether they agreed or not , they were n’t saying no .   
They were n’t telling us to go away and mind our own business .
“
Thank you , ”
I said , once I found the words .
Capricorn spoke up , “ Our goal with control is to keep an eye out for anything that would make the situation that much worse .   
If we take out or hamper these problem elements , the situation is free to wind down .   
If we do n’t , there ’s a risk it perpetuates , and that ’s something we want to avoid .
”
“ Resolution , then , ” Chevalier said .
I was so glad I ’d outlined things as Weld suggested , with clear objectives and scenario outlined in the first few pages .   
Chevalier was really using them as guideposts , picking up whenever nobody else was talking , keeping the meeting running smoothly .
“
What resolution do you want ?
”
“ We want a resolution , ” I said .   
“ If this ends and the Fallen are n’t wiped out , they ’ll hit back .   
The city suffers .   
If it ends and they are wiped out , Cedar Point is going to become something more pronounced .   
We ’ll want to be mindful of who is in play , and who might take charge of that .
”
“ As things come closer to a conclusion , we may take a role , ” Capricorn said .   
“ If we ’re strong enough , and if we have the resources , we could clean up those who are left .
”
“
That ’s a stretch , ” Sveta said .   
She had n’t said much , but I had the impression she was intimidated by the room .   
“
We focus on civilians first .   
We ’d need a lot of firepower before we can think about handling that kind of clean - up .
”
“
We ’re not in a position to give you a lot of firepower , ” Chevalier said , emphasizing ‘ lot’ .   
“
Valkyrie can not engage that group of Fallen , and I ’m tied up elsewhere with diplomatic roles .   
Many other Wardens and subordinate teams are busy .   
Advance Guard is on standby .   
We ’ll ask them to assist you .
”
I do n’t want them , I thought .
“ We have junior Wardens , as well .   
They ’ll assist .   
We ’ll let them know tonight and they ’ll be at your disposal tomorrow .
”
Them , I wanted .   
It meant Weld .   
It meant potential others , who I knew and very much respected .
“
Thank you , ”
Tristan said , my voice and Sveta ’s only a bit behind his .
“
You ’re right about this .   
We knew something was stirring , but we did n’t have the impression it was this bad .   
I ’ve been keeping updated on the Fallen , I ca n’t promise it ’s accurate , but you should know the families interact .   
There may be one or more of the Crowley sub - branches present .   
They also associate with various biker gangs , the various racist factions , and other religious villain groups and ideologues .   
Be prepared for any of them .
”
“
Yes sir , ” Tristan said .
“
In case of emergency , if you find you ’re in over your head , leave .   
Retreat , wash your hands of it .   
Your lives come first .
”
Sveta and I nodded , as Tristan said , “
Yes sir , ” again .
“
I think those are my thoughts , ” Chevalier said .   
“
Any further comments ?   
Anyone ?
”
Some heads shook .   
Others were silent .
He fixed his eyes on us .   
“
Any final thoughts , concerns ?   
Anything not in this document we should know , or anything you ’ve learned since writing it ?
”
There were a few somethings in the document we had n’t mentioned or outlined in full .
We ’d mentioned Rain , though not by name , as only a contact in the Fallen , who might or might not have been compromised .   
I ’d detailed how we had someone , Ashley , acting on our behalf in Cedar Point , and how we might have Rain in the Fallen camp when we took action .   
It would give us more control over the situation , if we had that information and those levers to pull .
We could have said more about Rain , and we had n’t .   
Rescuing him was a mission statement .
We had n’t said one word about the therapy group , or our individual issues and crises .
Much as I ’d wondered if I should mention my time in the hospital during job interviews or when applying to teams , I ’d been left the question of it here , standing before the committee .
I could be honest , say something , and they almost certainly would n’t let us do this .   
I could have mentioned my background when applying to teams , and I would have had even worse luck joining them .
Or I could stay silent .
“
No , ” Sveta said .   
Her voice was soft in what someone else might have mistaken for timidity .   
I knew she was nervous , but I did n’t think it was timidity .   
She was thinking the same thing I was .
“
No sir , ” Tristan said , with confidence .








It was an overcast day .   
Our nights were dark with the city power rationed and most apartments and businesses left unlit , and emerging from that to a day where the sun could n’t shine through had an effect on the mood of the Megalopolis .
I was fully in costume , and I was surrounded by people who were n’t .   
New Haven was n’t the closest settlement to the Fallen camp , but it was close enough that people were bound to pass through .   
It was the time of afternoon where everyone who had work was working , too late for lunch , too early to end the work day .
There were still people at the coffee shop , favoring very relaxed clothing .   
Some were students , part of one block or another , with no work for them for the moment .   
Most were keeping an eye on me .
Image was so important .   
I had my hood down , because it was large and heavy enough to be warm , and I did n’t want sweat in my eyes later , when it mattered .   
Having the hood down and the metal mask at my belt meant that I could present a fairly friendly face .
The coffee shop was somewhat industrial in feel , with a floor of poured concrete that had been altered after pouring to give it a look very similar to wooden floorboards .   
The bottom half of the employee ’s counter and the counters that jutted out from the walls with stools lined up beneath them were more concrete .   
Everything else was wood .
I waited in line like everyone else , encouraging the woman in front of me to stay in line when she offered to let me cut ahead .   
It could have been fear , respect , or help .   
Free coffee for the cop or feeling the pressure of a parahuman standing behind her .
There were looks from people who were clearly bothered by my being around .   
There was n’t much I could do about that .
On the other side of the coin , one of the teenagers who were n’t in school was trying to surreptitiously take a picture of me with his phone , which I noticed because the girl sitting next to him kept jostling him and trying to get him to put it down .   
Interest of the positive but borderline troubling sort .
I was reminded to check my phone .   
Kenzie was only a little way away , and was messaging to ask where to meet .   
It looked like Tristan had it handled .
The woman in front of me finished collecting her order .
Two boxes of donuts and other assorted breakfast desserts , stacked on top of one another and tied with twine , and one thing of coffees , plastic with four cup - holders and a handle in the middle .   
I    already had a soft drink , and I wedged it between the coffees before picking it all up .
“ Are there others in town ?
” the barista asked .
“
Others ?
”
“ Capes ?
”
“ We ’re passing through , ” I said .   
I keyed my voice to be audible by others .   
We were close enough to the Fallen camp
it was n’t out of the question that they would have people planted here to keep an eye out for trouble .
“
Okay .   
A lot of the ones who show up cause problems .
” That would be because this area of the city was relatively close to this group of the Fallen .   
There was another that was even closer to them , but it was small and somewhat disconnected from the city .   
A few houses , a gas station that doubled as a hardware supply and grocery store , and a dentist ’s .   
Here , at least , there was a place to watch movies .   
I could imagine Rain ’s peers piling into cars and driving into the town , and the headaches that no doubt followed .
“
I ’m more interested in solutions than problems , ” I said .
She smiled slightly .   
Her eye flicked to the next customer , and I took that as my cue to get out of line .
“ Have a nice day , ” I said .
As I turned around , the teenager at the one table put his phone down .   
His female friend looked unimpressed with him .
“ Want a photo ?
”
I asked him .
“
Hm ?   
No .
”
“ He does , ” the girl said , sounding as displeased as she ’d looked .
“
Here , ” I said .   
I put the donuts and coffee down on an empty chair on their table .   
I stepped back a bit , then flew , so my toe was barely touching the ground , my other leg bent slightly .   
I turned my body so the white gold color of my breastplate would catch the light coming in through the window .   
I put my hood up , and the ornament at the peak of the hood with rays forking up slapped my forehead .
I ’d need to figure out something to do about that .
He had his phone up by the time I settled into my pose , both hands on my hood , the parallel spikes that extended up from my shoulder now pointing back .
“
Got it , ” he said .   
“
Thanks .
”
“
Can I see ?
” I asked .
He showed me .
“
Is something happening ?
” he asked .
“ Somewhere else , ” I said .   
“
I ’ve got a ways to go to get there , though .
”
Not technically a lie .
“
Who are you ?
” he asked .
“
I ’m figuring that out , ” I said .   
“
But I ’m thinking I ’ll name myself after a star .
”
“ Cool , ” he said .
“
And I should get this to my people , ” I said , dropping out of my flight and rapping a finger on the lid of my cup .   
“
You take care .
”
“
You too , ” he said , a grin passing over his face .   
He nudged his friend .   
“ See , told you it was n’t a big deal .
”
“ Could ’ve been , ” she said .   
She shot me a smile .   
“
Sorry about him .   
Bye .
”
I winked at her before collecting my things and heading for the door .
It was stupid and people had probably been rolling their eyes at me in there , but I was left smiling .   
I liked being in costume again .
I kicked off of the ground and flew skyward .
The others would be arriving .   
Friendly faces .   
Some unfriendly ones .   
New Haven was our meeting place .   
There was a portal here , and it was one
I was familiar with .   
If I did n’t want to go through the portal in New Brockton , but I wanted to go to Brockton Bay , this had been the most convenient option .   
It had been where the patrol block passed through and focused most of its work .
Speaking of .
I found my place in the town and spotted the bus .   
New paint , some windows covered up rather than replaced , but it was the bus .   
I flew to it , timing my landing so I landed next to it while it was at a stop sign .
The door opened with an agonized sound that suggested some repairs still needed to be done .   
Jasper was in the front seat .
“
Hi , ” I said .   
A hand covered in coarse hair appeared from the side , giving a wave , and I poked my head in to see .   
Gilpatrick was sitting in the seat just in front of the stairs .   
Bald , bushy eyebrows , hairy arms , and Patrol outfit .   
I gave him a small wave back .
“
Hi , ” Jasper said .   
“
You look way different .
”
“
Should we get out ?
” Gilpatrick asked .
“ Not unless you have questions , ” I said .   
“
You got the documents ?
”
“
Yes , ” Gilpatrick said .   
“
New Haven patrol is already at the location .   
Others are still to arrive .   
We ’ll coordinate and figure out where we need to go once everyone ’s here .
”
“
Do n’t take the main road north or east .   
Take the dirt road to go east instead of the highway .   
The road you want to go down does n’t have a name .   
Just turn northward at the giant cow .
”
“ Giant cow ?
”
Jasper asked .
“ Wood .   
Someone had to be the first to build a giant cow , I guess , ” I said .
“
In a time when resources are scarce and we need to do all the building we can , someone built a giant cow ?
”
Jasper asked .
“
Let it go , ” Gilpatrick said .
“
Here , ” I said .   
I stepped into the bus , put the box down , and used one of the back - swept spikes of metal on my glove to cut the twine .   
I handed Gilpatrick the box .
“
Thank you .
”
“
Stay safe , ” I said .
“
Hey , before you go , ” Jasper said .   
He adjusted his sleeve .
“
Do n’t , ” someone said , behind him .
His sleeve up , he turned around to show me .   
A playing card , with a jester ’s cap on it .   
‘ Jester’ was spelled out beneath .
“
Everyone ’s giving me shit about it , ” he said , but he smiled .
“
You actually did it , ” I said .   
“
You like it ?
”
“
Yeah .
”
“
Then that ’s what ’s important . ”
He smiled .   
“
Yeah .
”
“
Are they calling you Jester like you wanted ?
”
“ They have to , do n’t they ?
” he asked , still smiling .
“
Yes they do .
”
“
Do n’t encourage him , ” Gilpatrick said .   
“
Get in touch after ,
okay ?   
We ’ll chat about how it went , catch up .
”
“ Will do .   
Thanks for everything , ” I said .
“ Anytime .
”
I collected the remaining box of donuts and the tray of coffee .   
I flew back and out the door of the bus rather than back down the stairs .   
The door was still closing , screeching shut , as Jester put the bus into motion .
The patrol would be part of our extended perimeter .   
Evacuating the citizens and containing the problem to just the Fallen camp were almost mutually exclusive things .   
We could n’t let people go without risking that they ’d cause trouble elsewhere .   
We ’d funnel them into the patrol block .
It ’d be three buses or vans filled with young men and women .   
All would be seventeen and older , uniformed , with guns and some semblance of an idea what to do .   
There would be instructors , many of whom were ex - PRT , and many graduates .
The others had already gathered , situating themselves in a parking lot with aborted construction of a store partially blocking them from view .   
Kenzie had arrived , and laid down at the back of the van , helmet off , legs bent at the knee and dangling over the bumper .   
A woman that was very clearly her mother stood a few feet away , her back to the open van door .   
Tristan , Sveta , and Chris were there , standing a distance away .   
Only Chris was uncostumed .   
He wore a beige sweatshirt with the hood up , and jeans .   
The ‘ sash’ he kept with him for wearing in costume was wrapped around his shoulders like a scarf .
I landed .
“
There you are , ” Tristan said .
“ I spotted Gilpatrick .   
Two of our four truckloads of Patrol guys are here .   
The other two are on schedule , I think .
”
“
Are those donuts ?
” Chris asked .
“ And coffees , with one soft drink , ” I said .
I handed over the box , giving Chris his soft drink .   
I distributed the coffees , giving one to Sveta and one to Tristan .   
Kenzie pulled on her helmet and jumped out of the back of the van , running past her mother .
“
You sure you do n’t want a drink ?
”
I asked Kenzie .   
I ’d asked in earlier phone conversation .
“
Have stuff in the car .
”
I looked back toward the ‘ car’ , the van , and made eye contact with Mrs. Martin .
Steel rings at the back of Mrs. Martin
’s head kept her dreads away from her face in a deliberately messy style , the metal of the rings a contrast to the hair and the skin that was closer to real black than brown .   
A series of steel bangles hung from her neck and one wrist , carrying on the aesthetic .
She wore an amazing bohemian - style top , predominantly red , the pattern detailed , the fabric as light and loose as it could be without floating off of her .   
The sleeves were cut so they technically stopped at the elbow , but the excess fabric at the bottom edge of the sleeve was such that it grazed the skin of her legs , beneath her shorts .   
Her sandals were stamped straps of red leather that went from her toes to encircle her ankle , red on black skin .
She was young enough she might well have been a teenager when she had Kenzie
, clearly fashionable , she was slim , and she had more poise than some superheroes I knew .
Put all of those things aside , and she could have been any parent at a PTA meeting , with stress lines in her face that did n’t match her age , and a rather normal face beneath her very striking makeup .
“ Mrs. Martin ?
” I asked .
“ Irene , ” she said .
“
Hi Irene , I ’m Victoria .
”   
I smiled and put out my hand to shake hers .   
She did n’t shake mine so much as she put her fingers in my palm .   
A little bit at a loss of what to do , I shook it as best as I could .   
She took it in stride .
A bit of a diva .
“
I love this , ” she said .   
She brushed her fingers down the front of my breastplate , then plucked at the fabric of my sleeve .
“
It ’s new .   
Made it yesterday .
”
“
In one day ?
”
“
Kind of .   
It was a group effort .
”
“
We added to my suit too , ” Sveta said .
Kenzie ’s mother gave Sveta a careful look .   
Sveta ’s body had curls and sweeping lines extending up from the shoulder , out from the elbow , and out of the collar of her top , which was more of a costume top than her other clothes .   
All had been painted .
“
It ’s good work , ”
Kenzie ’s
mother said .
“
My mom is kind of an artist , ” Kenzie said , as she came back from the donut box , two donuts in hand .   
“
She works with my dad right now .   
She does interior decorating .   
She makes houses look nice for sale , dad sells them , and she helps the families find the kinds of things they want after they buy .
”
“
I ’m an aesthete , not an artist , ”
Kenzie
’s
mom said .   
“
I appreciate others work and do what I can to make others appreciate those works .   
I ca n’t create much of my own .
”
“ Aesthete , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Got it .   
Do you want a donut , mom ?
”
“
No , ” her mother said .
“
You mean ‘ no thank you’ , ” Kenzie said .
Her mother gave her a look .
“ Manners , please , ” Kenzie said .   
“
We ’re with my friends .   
Do n’t embarrass me .
”
Irene Martin clapped her hands together , sharp , and turned to me with a smile .   
“ I do n’t want to fight .   
Are we going to get this machine out of the back ?
”
A part of me wanted to address the aborted conversation , but Tristan jumped in before I could .
“ I gave it a shot , Victoria , but I ’m far from being strong enough , ” Tristan said .
I glanced at Kenzie , who smiled .   
I decided to let the subject drop .
“
I strapped it up before I wheeled it in , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I hope that helps .
”
“ It does , ” I said .   
“
Out of the way .
”
They stood back .
I hope you like the costume I made for us ,
I thought , as I released the wretch .   
As far as I could understand it , I was effectively wearing clothing with room for three of me , too many sleeves , too many pants legs .   
I was putting my hands through two sleeves , into the matching gloves , and I had the benefit of the strength .   
If I was quick , I could do things before the other arms and legs started moving about , around me , in front of me , behind me .
I hauled it back as smoothly as I could .   
The others backed away more as I brought the large cube out onto the ground .
Mrs. Martin adjusted the back of the van to fix the ramp .   
She turned around .   
“
You have what you need ?
”
Kenzie climbed into the back and came out with some smaller cases .   
She put both donuts into her mouth , biting down into them to hold them , so her hands were free enough that she could pull three straps over her head .   
She retrieved the donuts .   
“
Yes .
”
Her mother shut the van door .
“
I wo n’t be home for dinner , probably , ” Kenzie said .
“ Will you need another ride ?
”
“ Probably not .   
I ’ll make my own way back .   
I ’ll be late .
You and dad can have a date night or something .
”
Irene Martin did n’t respond to that .   
She glanced at the other members of the group .
“
It ’s just a suggestion , ” Kenzie said .
“
You would n’t tell me what this is , but it ’s serious , is n’t it ?
” Kenzie groaned .
“
Is it ?
”
“
It ’s pretty serious .
”
“
Will I get a phone call tonight , telling me you ’re in the hospital ?
”
Kenzie groaned louder .   
“
Go .   
Thank you for the ride .   
Enjoy your day .   
Enjoy time with dad .   
Okay ?   
You do n’t have me around to bother you .
”
Irene Martin threw her hands up .   
Kenzie gave her a push , and Irene walked around to the driver ’s side .   
She turned around there .   
“ Victoria ?
”
“
Yes ?
”
“ You could come over for dinner some night .
”
“
Yes , ” Kenzie said .   
She did a double take , between her mom and me , then turned to me and said , “ You could .
”
“ I- ” I started .   
I wanted to connect to the team , help them , and divine any underlying crises or subterfuge .   
It was the first time I ’d seen the two of them even remotely on the same page .   
It seemed fine .   
“
Sure .
”
Kenzie pumped both fists .
Irene Martin pulled away .   
I turned to face the other members of the group ; Tristan , Sveta , and Chris were very different people , and all faced me with expressions of alarm and horror .
“
Yes , awesome , ” Kenzie said , as she joined the group , depositing her things .   
“
I can show you my main workshop .   
We could have a great dinner , my parents are top notch cooks .   
Do you like pasta ?
”
“ I do , yes .
”
“
There ’s a dish I love
and we have n’t had it in months because I could n’t find a good place for Italian sausage , but I did the research on my own and found one place with good reviews .   
I could ask my mom to make it .   
Oh , and you like cape stuff
, I have some magazines , and if you want them for your collection , we could collab .
” Chris approached .
“
My mom seemed to like you a lot , I have n’t ever known her to do that before .   
A lot of people- ” Chris took Kenzie ’s hand .   
Her eyes lit up as she kept talking .
“ -seem to like her a lot , she ’s a charmer , but she has n’t invited-
”
He maneuvered the donut Kenzie was holding into her mouth .
“ -amfohn oher beguh
, ” Kenzie said , around the donut .
“
Do n’t talk while you eat , ” Chris said .   
“ You ’ll choke .
” Kenzie nodded .
“
Let ’s focus on the mission , ” Chris said .
Kenzie nodded .
Tristan provided the update on where things stood .   
“
Advance Guard is here .   
They did n’t want to meet .   
They ’ll go to the north end of the compound and work south from there .   
The Wardens’ backup are running late .   
Transportation issues .
”
“
And Rain ?
” I asked .
“
No update , ” Sveta said .
“ Ashley ?
”
“ One message .   
She saw the clairvoyants getting ready and she took the opportunity to send something .   
She ’s on her way .   
Beast of Burden and his group are participating , but they ’re not cooperating with Prancer ’s group .   
They ’ll be independent and it sounds like they ’re out for blood .
”
“
Let ’s get this thing situated , while we still have a chance , ” I said .
⊙ A convoy of vehicles traveled down the highway .   
The cars ranged from the sleek and black to the ones that had n’t weathered the end of the world so well .
Kenzie ’s camera tracked them .   
There were several pickups , and some members of the various factions stood on the backs of the pickups , hair or capes flapping in the wind .   
One pickup had Moose in the back , with Etna sitting in front of him .   
Another had Beast of Burden , who was heavy enough the truck could n’t bring others .   
He was n’t huge , but the armor had heft and the back of the truck rode low to the ground .
Ashley was sitting in the passenger window of a vehicle , one of the three rustier , more worn out vehicles in Beast of Burden ’s convoy .   
One hand maintained her grip , so she could have her head and upper body outside the vehicle , hand out in the wind , hair flapping in the wind behind her .
Behind them , four mutant dogs the size of cars were running at a speed that kept up with the cars .   
They were meat and armor plates , with no rhyme or rhythm , for the most part .   
We were n’t in a position to zoom in or get any detailed looks , but I knew from past experience that up close , the meat would look like something between raw meat from an animal that had just been flayed , and the scale of a crocodile , dark and condensed down .   
One of the dogs , the one Bitch rode , was different from the others , symmetrical , leaner .
There were other cameras , but with only laptops to go by , we did n’t have a lot of screen real estate to go between them .
I hit the spacebar on the keyboard of my laptop .   
The camera switched to an overhead view of the dirt road outside the Fallen compound .   
We had the information on the Fallen the Wardens had provided .   
The address was one part of it .
We also had some notes on the parahumans within .   
A lot of them were strong .
Nobody was emerging from the Fallen ’s area .   
There were no visits to the nearby town with its gas station , no visits to New Haven , and nobody going to work .
Kenzie ’s cube was off to the side of the road , set in a ditch surrounded by tall grass .   
I ’d dropped straight in and flown straight up and out to minimize any scent trails and tracks .
I hit the spacebar again .
The Patrol .   
They were settled at the edge of the woods , gathered in small groups that formed a loose line .   
Vehicles were parked , boxes placed on the ground and used as seats .
I struck the key once more .
Advance Guard were more focused on the mission .   
Mayday was doing a lot of talking , while Mapwright went around touching people .   
Each person she touched had their eyes flare pink .   
The organization of the group was interesting to see , with the core members at the middle , others forming a loose ring around them , and the peripheral and utility members , I was assuming , at the very fringes , forming a second ring .
I hit spacebar .
Back to the first feed .
Alt - tab , and
I switched to an overhead map .   
Advance Guard had sent it to us in a message .   
It gave a view of the forest and roads , lines struck out for cliffs or other barriers .   
She ’d avoided detailing the settlement itself .
We had the details .   
Thinkers had always avoided scanning for the Mathers family because using a thinker power on or near them had a way of causing severe problems for the thinker .   
A strapped to a hospital bed screaming kind of severe .
I alt - tabbed back to the video .   
Tattletale either was n’t present , or was in a car , not on a dog .   
I studied the cars until I was pretty sure I recognized the one from the night prior .
“ They ’re here .
” I was bewildered on two counts .   
That I heard Tristan ’s voice but it sounded off , in a way that made me think someone had died or something had gone wrong .   
The other half of it was that I thought he meant the villains .   
Tattletale .   
Here somehow at the same time they were clearly elsewhere , on the video on my laptop .
It was n’t Tristan speaking oddly , but Byron speaking normally .   
His armor was the same general style as Tristan ’s , but it had a blue tint , and it was scale , not plate , with fins and conch spirals instead of spiraling horns .
And it was n’t the villains , who had somehow traveled the rest of the distance .   
It was the Wardens .
I smiled .   
“ Good to hear .   
How are you doing ?
”
“ Nervous .   
I think the kids are too .
”
The kids were sitting with their backs to the side of the building - in - progress .   
Nobody had come into the parking lot since we ’d arrived .   
Kenzie and Chris were chatting .   
They ’d decimated most of a box of twelve donuts between them .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
How much destructive power was packed into those cars , with those dogs ?   
How much was packed into that compound of Fallen ?
I folded up my laptop and slid it into my bag .   
I deposited it with Kenzie’ stuff .
“
Anything I can do ?
” I asked .
“
Do ?
”
“
To help you be less nervous .   
To make this easier .
”
Byron shook his head .
“
I appreciate you being here .   
I appreciate you being here too , Tristan , I know you ’ve been part of this since the beginning , but it matters .   
It matters more that you ’re willing to make this leap , Byron .
”
“
I was a hero once .   
I was n’t that bad at it , ” Byron said .   
“
I do n’t want kids and innocents to get hurt .   
I happen to think … a big way for kids and innocents to not get hurt is for this team to have never happened .
”
“
We ’re doing something good here , today , ” I said .
“
And I ’m here , ” Byron said .   
He shrugged , and his armor made a sound at the gesture .
I did n’t have a response for that .   
I got my things together and beckoned the kids .   
As we walked beneath the building , Sveta dropped down from the roof , reeling in her arms with enough force she wobbled mid - step .
The Wardens were a block away .
Narwhal .   
A big name .   
She was tall and her horn exaggerated that fact .   
Her body was covered in scintillating shards of forcefield that looked grey - blue in the light from the sky above .
Weld was there .   
He had a bag with him that had to have weighed a hundred pounds .   
Gear for a teammate .
There were seven others .   
They were faces I did n’t recognize .
And , last but not least , Vista .   
She had to be seventeen now .   
As old as I ’d been when I ’d been hospitalized .   
She ’d updated her costume to show the skin she had n’t been able to show as a Ward , with legs bare , shoulders and arms uncovered , and she ’d dressed up other parts , with new gloves and boots with less cloth and more armor , and a redecoration of the breastplate , so it had grooves running through it .   
There was a texture to her visor , to the point that it just looked like a pane of opaque green glass , etched with ripples .   
She had a scarf loose around her shoulders more than her neck , which made me think of Miss Militia .
“
Hey , little V , ” I said .   
“
Not so little anymore .
”
“
Hey big V , ” she said .   
“
What a time to meet , huh ?   
We need to hang out .
”
“ We do .   
So much , ” I said .
She approached and gave me a hug , the breastplate of her armor clacking against mine .   
She squeezed me and I squeezed her back .
“
I heard you were better , ” she said , quiet .
“
Great to see you , ” I said .   
“
It seems a lot of other Brockton Bay names are appearing .
”
“ Tattletale .   
Rachel .   
Foil .   
The other Undersiders .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .
We broke the hug .   
She gave my arm a pat as she stepped back .   
Weld clasped my hand .   
His other arm was already around Sveta .
“
You ’re down for this ?
” I asked .
“ You know I am , ” Weld said .
“
Oh yeah ,
” she said .   
“ Point me at the bad guys .   
I ’ll turn their world upside - down .
”
“ They ’ll be here in a minute , ” I said .   
Tristan was n’t here , so I was the de - facto leader on our side .   
“
You ’ve read the doc ?
”
“
Yes , ” Narwhal said .   
“ Vista , would you do us the honors ?
”
We were n’t far from the edge of New Haven .   
The surroundings began to distort .
“
My cameras !
”
Looksee cried out .   
“ Ugggh .   
They do n’t like so many powers and
so many of those powers are from your city .
”
“
You ’re staying , Looksee , ” I said .   
“ Narwhal , do you have a group hanging back ?
”
“
Our thinker and our blaster , ” Narwhal said .   
“
They ’ll keep your tinker safe .
”
“
Do n’t talk their ear off , Looksee , ” Chris said .
“
My cameras do not know how to deal with this power , ” Kenzie said , oblivious .
The space ahead of us continued to fold into itself .   
Street , road , grass , trees and field all compressed .   
The effect was to create something that looked almost like a portal .
Two portals , I realized .   
The angle of the other was n’t clear , to the point the distortions masked it .
Our groups parted ways .   
From a city under an overcast sky to foliage .   
The forest was dark .   
Chris was the first to walk through .   
Eager , even .
“ Phones on vibrate , careful from this point forward , ” I said .   
I changed my phone .
Sveta , Byron and I passed through , entering the forest at the periphery of the Fallen camp .   
Paths cut between the trees , left by animals and not people .
It was dark , and for the most part , we were well camouflaged , in the dark .
Ahead of us , Chris was crouching .   
He had a hand at the corner of his mouth , and he was working out the wire from his external braces .   
His mouth yawned open and he looked incredibly uncomfortable as he adjusted , head twisting this way and that .
From the central pocket of his hooded sweatshirt , he pulled out a disc .   
He tapped it twice .   
A projection wrapped around him .   
Camouflage .
It did n’t make him transparent .   
It did seem to pull things from his surroundings and create a patchwork exterior .   
Bark , grass , greenery , a slice of fur .   
The patches did n’t line up , so it looked more like a nature - themed scrapbook collage than a second skin .
I saw him part his lips in a smile , and the projection disc seemed to take a moment to remember what teeth and braces were .   
The teeth were there on their own , then they became part of the collage .   
The metal bits of the braces , sans wire , were next .
He had a second disc .   
He pressed a button .
A projection of Looksee appeared , crouching as well .
“
Cameras are showing them on their way .   
I ’m putting it through to your phones , but it might be- ”
Chris adjusted something on the disc .    
The volume of Looksee ’s voice dropped second by second .
Nearly mute , she turned to Chris , hands on her hips .
“ If she ’s reporting something , let her , ” I said .
I pulled out my phone .
The camera footage flickered violently , with patches here and there where undulating lines of code flashed pink against a red background .   
What I could see at the fringes were that Hollow Point ’s convoy was a minute away .
If the shrinking of the glitchy area on the phone was any indication , Vista ’s adjustments would be gone by the time the villains turned up .
“
I ’ll let my brother take point .   
We trade places as we need to , ” Byron said .   
“
We ’ll play this by ear , like we used to .   
Remember that innocent lives are on the line .   
Even among the Fallen .
”
He blurred .
“
They ’re our priority , ” I said .
“ Deal , ” Tristan said , as he settled in .   
He was just a hair more obvious than Byron had been , with the red tint to the metal , standing amid a forest of greens , browns , and grays .
Her volume back to ninety percent of normal , Kenzie reported , “ Advance Guard is at the twelve o’clock , Wardens to the nine .   
We ’ve got the five o’clock point , road is to our north at the four , running into the camp from the east .   
The Patrol block is on standby at the two .
”
I mentally mapped it out .
“ I ’ll save my changes , ” Chris said .   
He moved into an area of deeper shadow , and the projection overadjusted for a moment .   
“
For now , I ’ll skulk .   
I ’m good at skulking .
”
I frowned at him .   
“
You hang back .   
Your job is to escort people out .   
Direct them to the Patrol group , who can figure out how to deal with them .
”
“ I know , ” he said .   
“
I can do other stuff .
”
The phone was n’t quite as good a view as the laptop had been .   
The images were squashed , the figures too small to easily make out .   
I saw the white blur of Ashley ’s hair , saw her disappear into the vehicle .
The dogs lagged behind the cars and trucks .   
Some of the cars fell behind as well .
As the majority of the convoy turned north off of the highway , Tattletale ’s group , dogs included , continued on into New Haven .
“ Be safe , Looksee , ” I said .   
“
There ’s a not insignificant chance she ’d target you and use you to find Rain .   
They have the dogs .
”
The projection of Looksee nodded .
The convoy continued to disintegrate .   
The road as the road made its gradual turn , where it would stab into the Fallen camp from the east .    
Whoever Beast of Burden had driving was happy to ignore the road and drive into field .   
Truck tires spun through mud , kicking up detritus .
Depending on where they came in , they might run into the Patrol block .
The bulk , however , were heading down the main dirt road into the camp .
“ Tattletale is parking , ” Looksee reported .   
“
They planned to situate themselves around here .
”
“ Shh , ” I said .
I could hear the crackle of stones being kicked up by tires on the dirt road , tires tearing through loose terrain .
I could see them .    
A hundred feet away , barely visible through the gaps in the trees , they were going way too fast down the unfamiliar road .
When the last of the vehicles passed us , we moved toward them , so we ’d be at their tail .   
Chris’ temporary projection - costume altered rapidly to absorb the surroundings .   
It got weird here and there where it caught a flash of Tristan ’s armor or my face .
I heard the distant detonation that marked the first shot fired , the start of the war between the Hollow and the Fallen .    
I could n’t tell if it was a trap laid for the vehicles or a power used by the raiding attackers .
We picked up speed .   
I took flight , and flew fast enough through the trees that I needed to put my hands out , touching and deflecting trees in passing .
My plan was to draw close enough that I could identify what was happening .   
That would let me help coordinate the group .
If one side was clearly overwhelmed from the start , it dramatically changed how we would be approaching this .   
The Fallen being annihilated was bad in its own way , much as Hollow Point ’s group being annihilated .   
One suggested civilians would die at the hands of reckless attackers .   
The other promised retaliation from the defending party , aimed at a nonspecific enemy .
There was something that mandated a change in our approach , from the very moment the explosion sounded and the engagement was started .   
It was n’t what I ’d expected .








The gunfire continued .   
I flew back to the others , positioning myself a good twenty feet from them .   
My power was active , serving to shield them .
“ Get behind cover , ” I said .
I was glad to see them listen .   
Not only did they get to safety , but they were n’t in a position to see if the wretch reached out to any nearby vegetation .
The rules of ‘ the game’ were that guns were verboten .   
‘ The game’ .   
Gangs liked the terminology , and I was pretty sure it had stemmed from that culture .   
It was the nature of social groups to self - moderate .   
Things that were selfish and advantageous but that went against the group
’s
greater interests were acted on .   
Capes leaned pretty heavily on that abstract moderating force , because the laws had never kept up with us and we ’d had to moderate ourselves .
That was the game .   
It was the walking of the line between the selfish things we did for ourselves and our teams and what served the greater good .   
Secret identities were to be left alone .   
Families were n’t to be touched .   
The day to day of the city and civilian lives were n’t allowed to be disrupted .   
No killing ; no guns .
Capes used swords , crossbows , they used bows and other weapons that were just as lethal as a gun , given a chance .   
Most of the time it was to coordinate with another power .   
Capes threw explosive chunks of their bodies , among other things .   
My home town had had Miss Militia in a role as lieutenant of the Protectorate and then as leader of the team , and she had guns as part of her power .
It came down to symbols , to what the gun meant , and whether the person with the gun was playing along .   
With a sword or bow , the assumption was yes .   
When a gun was drawn or fired , barring any context , the assumption was –had to be , even-
no .   
Carrying a gun as a cape and using it implied things that other weapons did n’t .
Tattletale had aimed a handgun at me once , and she had pulled the trigger .   
In that , at least , she had been playing along .   
It had been a tool , not a weapon .   
I had some grievances when it came to her , but that was n’t one of them .
The Fallen and the villains of Hollow Point ?   
They were n’t playing any games .   
Powers were used , and a tight cluster of three or four explosions in quick succession were followed by creaking , snapping sounds that might have been trees or a building collapsing .
I heard the sound of wood splintering near me , and I turned my head in time to see the side of a tree crunch inward , as if two axes had bit into it .   
Bit .   
The wretch was taking a bite out of the wood .
There were other signs of the wretch ’s restlessness nearby .   
Bark was scraped from trees by hands .
I dropped my forcefield and stepped around a tree until it stood between me and the ongoing gunfire .   
My back to the tree
’s trunk , facing the others , I asked ,
“
You guys
okay ?
”
“ I do n’t think they ’re firing in this direction , ” Capricorn said .
“
Can you provide some cover ?
” I asked .   
“
I do n’t think anyone ’s close .
”
“
Yeah .
”
The orange motes began to dance between trees .
“
We move toward the road , ” I said .   
“
We ’ll cross it , and then we cut toward the settlement .
”
“ Victoria , you take point .   
Sveta , put yourself between her and us .   
Kids , with me .   
Looksee , watch what your camera is looking at .   
I do n’t want you getting hit by the anti - thinker measures .
”
“ Uh huh .   
Tattletale went into a building with some henchmen .   
She waved at the camera and smiled , which was kind of nice , if you look at it a certain way .   
Foil , Parian , Hellhound and Imp are leaving and going up your way .   
If you guys decided you had to run with the guns , you could come back and come after her .   
That could be good .
”
“ Brevity , ” Chris said .   
“
This is a situation , Looksee , use fewer words .
”
“
Okay , ” she said .
“
Let ’s stick to the plan , ” Capricorn said .   
He gave me a sidelong look as he said it , and I nodded in response to the unspoken question .
He moved his hand , and walls snapped into existence where the orange motes had been .   
Their height was such that if I stood straight , I could look over the parts where the spikes did n’t stick up .   
So long as I crouched , I was clear .   
I flew low to the ground , the walls to my left , in the direction of the road .
I could hear something that might have been a motorcycle or dirt bike .   
Others started up .   
Gunfire answered the revving .
At the end of the wall , I crouched lower to the ground .   
Flight let me move silently .
The revving got louder , until I could feel it in my chest .   
I could hear the sound of wheels kicking stuff up , the snapping of branches , and in my efforts to tell where the bike was on the road , I was totally lost .   
It sounded like it was coming right toward me .
As the bike drew nearer , the sounds became clear .   
The tearing sound of the wheels was n’t from wheels on a dirt road , but underbrush .   
I canceled my forcefield and drew my arms closer to my chest , so they would n’t be out to the side .
The bike flew past me .   
It was a road bike , with metal teeth on the wheels , probably for situations just like this one .   
One hand on a submachine gun , an Uzi , the other on the handlebars , he zig - zagged heavily , riding it through dense forest , throwing his bike to one side or the other with all of his body weight .   
Each turn seemed like it might be his last .
His rear wheel skidded along a growth of roots that was as broad as some trees , he popped a wheelie , and when the wheel came down , he came to a stop , now facing more in my direction .   
Young - ish .   
Maybe thirty .   
His hair was long and he had a longer beard , black and narrow at the chin , a metal thing just below his lip .   
With the cut of his mustache , the points at his eyebrows , and his sunglasses all resembling the shape of the wings of the bats on his leather jacket , I was getting a sense of his theme .
I was n’t sure if he ’d seen me .   
I remained still .   
I realized a moment later that , given the theme , that might be a dumb thing to do .
His head bent down , facing the ground , and he was panting for breath .   
He passed his gun to his right hand .
The wind blew past us .   
Dust from his trip across the forest floor was riled up further , instead of settling down .
His head turned my way .
I took off , not flying directly at him , but to a point off to his side .   
Forcefield up , I kept trees between us for good measure .
He shot a burst , and it sounded more like one sound than a series of distinct ones .   
I could feel the forcefield collapse like a bubble popping .   
The collapse was almost instantaneous , but not entirely .   
The bullet had touched a point somewhere behind my feet , and once the forcefield gave , the breaking of the field cascaded from there in the blink of an eye .
My hand went out , and I grabbed a tree to help stop myself as I ceased flying .   
Tree between us , I flew straight up , arms around my head to shield myself from intervening branches .
Covered by the thickest of the trees , I circled around him .
The engine revved , wheels digging for traction .
He rode off in the direction of the dirt road , and I went after him , staying at the level where the peaks and upper reaches of the trees provided some cover , but were far enough from one another that I could easily fly through the gaps and keep one eye on the biker .
He rode away from me like he knew where I was .   
Even though he was riding recklessly , he still needed to zig - zag , and I was n’t sure he would have been any faster than me on a clear path .   
I could get ahead of him , above him .
He fired .   
I could hear the submachine gun fire one burst , then another .     
I could hear the bullets cutting through the air , but they did n’t touch the wretch or me .
I dove , wretch active , and when I cut through the leaves and found a large branch in my way , I let the wretch collide with it .   
He ’d made enough noise with that gun , and I could make some by breaking the branch clean off the tree .
The bike roared as he kicked it into life , using it to get himself clear of the falling wood .   
Could n’t get a bead on me , so he was running .
I was already moving , though .   
The moment I knew where he was going , I moved to intercept .   
In his haste to get going and find his balance , he ’d laid the uzi against one of the handlebars .   
He was n’t in a position to aim it at me .
I caught the weapon and the hand that gripped it .   
He tried to adjust , another wheelie with a spin as everything rested on the back wheel as a kind of forced stop or attempt to bring the bike around to collide with me .   
I hauled him back and away from the bike before he could finish the motion .   
He tumbled into moss , stones , and weeds , emtpy - handed .
Wretch out , uzi held firmly in my hand , I flew at the bike as it tumbled to the ground .   
I swung my hand , backhanded , and the wretch followed suit , demolishing it .
Bat - biker did n’t get up or do much except lie on his side , panting hard .   
The fall had n’t been hard enough to incapacitate him .
A fear response ?   
I did n’t even have my aura out .
I approached him and set one foot on his wrist , so it would be easier to keep an eye on the other .   
“
I ’m betting someone like you has other weapons .   
Tell me where , and do n’t touch them unless you want me to treat you like I treated your bike .
”
He went very still .
I pushed out with my aura , keeping it small .   
I did n’t want to tip anyone else off about my presence .
“ Weapons .   
Now , ” I said .
When I moved my hand , still holding the uzi , he responded by moving his free arm , hiking up his jacket .   
I could see the handgun there .   
A beefy , overcompensation sort of gun , which did n’t really suit his average frame .
It seemed he respected the gun more than the person with powers .   
Stupid .
I collected the handgun .   
Kicking with one foot , I pushed one of his pant legs up , then the other .
Knife at the ankle .   
I kept the gun trained on him , released his wrist , and retrieved the knife .   
He did n’t resist as I stepped on his wrist once again .   
My hands were pretty full at this point .
“
What else ?
” I asked .
“
That ’s it .
”
Prodding with my toe , using flight to avoid putting too much weight on his wrist , I investigated his jacket .   
Something rattled .
“
What ’s here ?
”
“ Cigarettes . ”
“ Remove them .   
Throw them aside .   
Slowly .
” He did .   
It was a large carton of cigarettes , but as it landed , there were needles with caps on inside , sitting at an angle .
I raised an eyebrow .
“ Medical , really , ” he said .   
“ Helps with the headaches from my power .
”
“
Do n’t leave stuff out , ” I said , amping up my aura some more .   
I poked more with my toe , and found another weight at the vest pocket of his jacket .
“ Phone , ” he volunteered .
I kicked down , catching the phone between my heel and a rock .   
I heard something break .   
I did it again .   
I saw his expression change , a snarl .
I flew up and away from him , until I could see the surroundings .   
I spotted a hole in a tree , and put the weapons within .
He was on his feet by the time I got back to him .   
He backed away a step , then fell on his ass .
“ Bikers .   
You ’re on the Fallen ’s side in this ?
”
He twisted up his face into a scowl so fierce that it looked like a pretty sure thing he would n’t open his mouth .
“ I ’ll take that as a yes , ” I said .
I flew at him .   
He swung a punch my way , and I put my forcefield up .   
His arm was too far out to the side , and he did n’t even hit me hard enough to drop my defenses .
I moved right into his personal space , and the sour sweat smell of him made me wish I had n’t .   
Seizing his belt buckle in one hand and his belt in the other , I flew .
He was heavy , as I dismissed my defenses .   
His arms were free and he could have swung a punch , but it would have done more harm to him than to me .   
Instead , faced with my aura and a very swift ascent , he grabbed onto the top edge of my breastplate for leverage .
We reached the treetops , where the branches were thinner .   
I roughly deposited him on something that looked reasonably sturdy and unreasonably high up .   
The impact of my setting him down helped to break his grip on me .
I could hear the gunfire continuing .   
It had moved .   
By the sound of it , Hollow Point ’s group was venturing along one edge of the camp , moving counter - clockwise along the perimeter .
“
Stay put , ” I said .   
I seized his foot and pulled it down , then undid the laces on his boots .   
I tied them around a branch .   
“
I can make you more comfortable and leave you a way down if you talk .
”
“ Fuck you , ” he said .   
He clung tight to a branch .
I tied the laces of his other boot to another branch .   
Then I identified a few key branches he could use to climb down , and , strength up , demolished the first with a sharp strike .
“ Shit !
”
he said , voice going higher as the branch he was on wobbled .   
“ Shit !
”
I broke another .   
Not the cleanest break , it might have served as a foothold or handhold .   
I kicked it again to make it less of one .
When three branches were broken and there was a good ten feet between the branch he was on and the nearest handhold or foothold , I flew back , assessing the situation .   
He could n’t let go of the trunk in front of the branch he was sitting on , and he could n’t bend low enough to untie his laces , even if he could let go .
“
I ’m not going to say shit , ” he said .
You just did , a few times , I thought .   
My expression remained deadpan .
I did n’t give him a response .   
Instead , I left him where he was , and flew down to the ground .
There was a time when using my powers had made me feel powerful .   
Having superstrength had made me feel strong .   
Having an aura that instilled awe had made me feel awesome .
I did n’t feel that same rush now .   
I felt melancholy .
There were more coming through the trees .   
They did n’t seem especially aware of me , or mindful of the earlier gunfire .
More people in leather jackets .   
Beards and some sunglasses .   
I flew up to a higher branch .
Bikers , except these guys did n’t have bikes with them .   
They ’d be part of the Fallen ’s network .   
While Prancer ’s side of Hollow Point seemed to be willing to play by the rules of the game , the Fallen had n’t been so inclined , even before Gold Morning .   
They had n’t felt the social pressures because they had n’t been part of society , living on the fringes and putting a wall between themselves and others .   
They ’d had allies of necessity for certain events and causes , and the bikers had been some of those allies .
When people had n’t been able to go after the Fallen , the pressures and responses for the Fallen ’s actions had come to rest on the heads of the bikers and other allies .   
People had been less willing to deal with them , more force had been used against them , and the message had been driven home .
The problem with the cycle was that being on the outs made them more likely to bend or break the rules .   
The wedge between them and everyone else had also made them more inclined to simply fold into the Fallen , especially after Gold Morning .
The amnesty was a thing , crimes had been pardoned , but feelings were still feelings .   
The bikers had backed up some of the shittiest people around , and that was hard to let go of .
There were three people moving through the trees as a group .   
Their attention seemed to be fixed on flanking Hollow Point .   
That would ’ve been the motorcycle guy
’s intention too , then .   
Getting around behind and opening fire .
Two of them were heavy , and could ’ve been brothers .   
One of the heavy ones had a tattoo that was partially obscured by his glasses , and a goatee .   
The other had a metal shackle of a collar around a neck that really was too wide for most metal collars .   
It made skin bulge out the top and bottom .   
Similar shackle - like cuffs were at his wrists and ankles , but they were n’t so bulgy .
The one in the center was a breaker .   
He was a wraith of a person , a statue broken up into solid segments that were hard and almost ceramic in appearance , with electric blue lines spiraling around each of the jet black , ceramic - ish , solid parts .   
They were connected to other parts by only a deep blue smoke that was hard to look too deeply at .   
His face was less of a face and more of a solid , triangular surface with a series of six or seven holes bored into it .   
Each hole was ridged with a corkscrew pattern , cone - shaped .
He did n’t walk and he did n’t fly .   
He had legs that existed as a jumble of segments , they moved , and he kind of was in places .   
It reminded me of the animated optical illusions where circles continually rippled outward and appeared to grow endlessly , but they did n’t actually grow .
In his case , the lines and edges of the harder body moved and rippled back , he appeared to stay in place , but he actually moved , with the indigo - blue smoke billowing out behind him .
Two guns .   
Shackle - guy had a handgun , and the guy with the goatee had a shotgun .   
Breakers did n’t tend to have gear .
I flew over their heads , and I saw that the breaker ’s face was n’t three dimensional .   
It was such
that
no matter what angle I viewed it from , it always faced me .
He did n’t react like he saw me , though .   
Not just yet .
One of the most underrated things about flying was that it was silent .
I took advantage , lowering myself down behind the guy with the goatee .
The spiraling on the breaker ’s arm intensified .   
I adjusted my flight course- realized belatedly that he was swiping at me .   
It was hard to process his movements , because he seemed to retroactively be wherever he was going .   
It was my perceptions , I was pretty sure , and not time manipulation or anything .
He swiped again , and I maneuvered , moving around his buddy at the same moment .   
He had reach , arm extending as the gap widened between the floating segments of forearm , and parts of a hand .
I shone with my aura , no longer being subtle , seizing the shotgun and put my foot on the goatee guy
’s shoulder .   
I flew up and pushed down and out with my foot .   
My interest was twofold- to kick him toward his breaker buddy ’s arm , and    to use full - body leverage to get the shotgun out of his hand .   
He had good trigger discipline , and so me pulling the gun away did n’t also pull the trigger against his finger .
I had the shotgun
and I ’d put myself far enough away to be out of the blue breaker
’s reach .   
I brought out the wretch and had it demolish the shotgun in my hands .
If I was going to use an all - or - nothing weapon , I ’d rather use the ones I was familiar with .
Still turning in the air , I traveled an unpredictable course , arcing down to the ground , hugging the ground as I traveled a quarter - circle arc , ever - mindful of the guy with handgun .   
He aimed at me and fired .
His bullet hit the wretch , and I hit him at the knees , bowling him over .
Before he was on his feet , and before the blue breaker could swipe at me , I grabbed him by the ankles .   
Flying , I dragged him across the forest floor .   
More to the point , I dragged him in a way that put his upper body and face closer to the ground as I dragged him .
He grabbed me by the wrist , and it took me a second to realize the how and why of it .   
I ’d had him by the ankle , and his foot was now a hand .   
He was strong- enough that I thought something would pop or break if he squeezed any harder .
I changed course , and I flew him into the base of a tree trunk .   
I heard the solid impact , and I felt the ‘ leg’ I was holding jerk in reaction to the pain , but I did n’t succeed in breaking his grip .
He had a foot where his head had been , and hands at the end of neck , ankle , and each arm .   
The shackles seemed to be the point where the changes happened .   
When he bent to bring a hand toward my face , it was with a crease between what should have been crotch and shoulder and far more flexibility than a man his size should have managed .   
I struck his hand away with a backhand strike , my forearm catching his wrist .   
Another hand grabbed me by the belt .
My focus , though , was on the hand that still held the handgun .   
He had his bearings , and he brought it around to point it at me .   
I seized it , fingers hooked around barrel and handle both .
I hated guns being brought to a cape fight .
I twisted around , heaving him up and bringing the wretch to bear for some added strength at the last moment .   
I slammed him into the tree , harder .
His grip weakened .   
I wanted to fly away , but we both still had a mutual , contested grip on the weapon .
The breaker was coming for me , swelling in my vision .   
It reached , and fingers brushed through foliage .   
The greenery stretched like it was ooze , strands and bends and all .
When it snapped , it coiled and curled away like smoke , black with blue sparks in it , like a burning paper might have orange .
The rule for fighting breakers was to not fight them in their breaker state , because the breaker states tended to cheat the rules .
I could n’t wrestle the handgun free , even with the shackled biker weak from his second visit to the tree
’s trunk .   
I bent his wrist back as far as it could , his fingers bending backward as I brought the gun over to one side .   
His hand began changing , the front of the hand becoming the back , fingers finding angles to grip the gun .   
He reaffirmed his grip .
He did , however , also lose a bit of ground around the trigger .   
I checked , then shifted my grip more to the handle and the area around the trigger guard , before pulling the trigger repeatedly .   
Not easy , given the angle .   
Not easy , when each shot kicked and was loud , and I had a breaker lurking at the corner of my vision , not registering as having any depth in my depth perception .
I was n’t quite sure what would happen , but I gripped one of the shackles .   
For just a moment , I let the wretch out , giving myself the strength to crush it in my hand .
For that same moment , the wretch did something , and the entire body jerked , cloth ripping .
The metal shackle broke , and the hand spasmed , letting go of the handgun .
There was a wound in his stomach , and it closed as he lay there .   
At the same time , his hand multiplied , swelled , had fingers and teeth appear , and became a misshapen blob .   
The effect crawled up his arm to his body , which bloated and swelled .
A mouth opened in the middle of it .   
It snapped in my general direction .
I pushed my aura out as hard as I could .   
The mass of flesh withdrew into itself .   
The breaker stopped .
I stared down at the changer - in - flux .   
A mess of hands , a mess of legs , teeth , fleeting facial features .
My aura radiated intense fear and awe , enough to stop grown men and monsters in their tracks , and in the midst of it all , I felt that melancholy .
“
This ?
” I spoke .   
“
What you ’re feeling is a four .   
The dial goes up to ten .
”
The breaker ’s fingers traced the side of a tree .   
The wood became goo and it stretched .
“
You can feel the intensity of it , ca n’t you ?
” I asked .   
“
You do not want me to turn up this dial .   
Because this ?   
This is a six .
”
I was close enough to trees and ground that when I brought the wretch out , it could reach those things .   
It broke up the dirt and it bit into wood with fingers .   
The wood creaked until hands clenched hard enough to break it , and then it broke explosively .
“
If I turn it up any higher , you ’ll feel that too , ” I said .   
I had the handgun .   
I looked down at it to figure out how to release the magazine .   
I threw the magazine down to the ground and held out the gun .
There was a moment ’s pause , and then the wretch took hold of the weapon .   
It flung it out , slamming it into a tree hard enough that it sank into the wood of the trunk .
Still maintaining a grip on the weapon , the wretch dragged it about a foot toward the base of the trunk before it could n’t anymore .   
A moment later , the metal began distorting .   
Something broke and fell .
“
You , blue breaker .   
Go back to being human .   
All of you stand down .
” Goatee looked at his friend or brother .   
The wretched thing at the base of a tree .   
He did n’t stand down , and the breaker did n’t go human .
Maybe it was a minion for goatee guy .   
It was a hell of a minion , if so .   
Whatever it was , minion or breaker , I was n’t about to change my policy on staying the hell away from it .
The breaker started toward me .   
It stopped when orange motes began appearing .   
I dismissed the wretch , watching as they looked around .
“
That , ” I said .   
“ Is an eight .
”
The breaker reached out and touched a mote .   
It stretched the mote in the air .   
There were lines around it , and it pushed through trails that had been left behind motes , distorting them too , stretching them like it had the leaf .
“
I ’m
pretty sure you do n’t want to do that
, ” I said .
It stopped .
Sveta ’s hand reached through the trees , grabbed goatee guy , and hauled him into the orange motes .
Everything snapped into being , except the lines the breaker had altered .   
They remained where they were , jumping around , wiggling and distorting , before they found a solid form as a spray of rock fragments .   
I brought my defenses up just in time to deflect the worst of it .
The goatee guy was caught , orange motes around his legs .   
The breaker waded through it like it was glue .
The stone became water .   
The breaker no longer waded through it , instead struggling to hold its general shape as the water pushed and sprayed through the smoke .   
Some of the water was forceful enough to bring small branches down from trees overhead .
As the water ’s spray dissipated , the breaker sagged .   
The smoke was mostly gone .   
It crumpled , and the segments dissolved into a thicker smoke .   
As they blew away , one of the bikers was left in the center .   
A mid - thirties woman with a blue tank - top with a faded motorcycle logo on the front , a potbelly , and a complexion to match the most acne - ridden teenager from my old high school .
“
It ’s an eight , ” I said , quiet and mostly to myself ,
“
But it ’s not my eight .
”
She started to get to her feet , then slipped in the mud .   
She remained hunched over .
“ We need to have a conversation , ” I said .
She spat .
“
Your friend .   
He okay ?
”
“ He gets like that sometimes .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .   
I tried to avoid looking at the shuffling mass of flesh .   
Before , it had been only the hands , feet , and head that had changed .   
Now it was everything but those things .
On a level , I felt bad that I could n’t look straight at it and that I ’d been hurt by others that had once been unable to look straight at me .
On another level , I knew even I ’d had a hard time looking straight at me , when I ’d been that way .   
I still did .   
I ’d never really blamed anyone .   
For abandoning me , yes , but not for not looking .
“
You ’re going to tell us the layout of the Fallen camp .
”
“ Ca n’t , ” she said .   
“ Fuck .
”
“
The anti - thinker measure .   
Where and who ?
”
“
Ca n’t .
”
The others emerged from the woods .   
Sveta .   
Capricorn in blue .
“
You ’re going to need to give me something , ” I said .
“ We came to help out the Crowleys .   
We hang with them sometimes .   
They ’re harmless , ” she said .   
“
The-
other branch , it is n’t .
”
“
The Mathers , ” I said .
“
I ’m being told to tell you something .   
You do n’t need to hide at the fringes .   
You ’re welcome to join in , and you ’re expected .   
They-
they ’ll embrace you with open arms .
”
“ You ’re being told ?
”
“ Fuck them , and fuck this , ”
the woman with the blue top said .   
“ Not
what I signed up for .   
They got us in here , we were partying last night , and then , out of nowhere- ”
“
Hey , ” the guy with the goatee said .
“
Her , ” she finished .   
She turned her head away .   
“ I ca n’t explain .   
She says she has hostages .   
People you know and people who those people care about .   
You can mess with the attackers , but if you get in the way of the Fallen , people are going to lose body parts .
”
Byron spoke up , “ Can you take a message back to her ?
”
“ I do n’t know , ” the biker woman said , sullen .   
“ I don’t- ”
She paused .
“
What ? ”
Byron asked .
“
She says no , no messages .   
Other stuff .   
She-
”
Her eyes went wide .   
She looked around , her eyes not focused on anything in particular .
The woman ’s voice carried forward , but it was an inarticulate sound , one that became higher
, then a warbling shriek , followed by a gasp for air with a sound of its own .
She dropped to the ground , fingers clawing in dirt , twisting like she was trying to get away from everything at once .   
The noises she made were horrible , and I ’d heard some awful noises in my life .
Goatee guy started to approach her .   
He stopped when I flew a little closer .
“
Stop .   
What do you do ?
”
“
Do ?   
I ’m decent with a gun .
”
“
That ’s your power ?
”
“
No .   
No powers , ” he said .   
He sounded stunned by the question .   
In the moment , I could see how bothered he was and I had trouble believing he could concoct a good lie .
The woman was curled up now .   
She pulsed , and with each pulse , dark cracks ran across her body and over her clothes , then faded away .
After a few tries , she stopped trying .   
She shrieked , and then strangled the shriek .
“ Is there anything we can do for her ?
” Sveta asked .
“ We could try knocking her out , ” Capricorn said .   
It was Tristan now .   
“
But it ’s not like in movies .   
That kind of thing does brain damage .
”
“ I think this does damage of its own , ” I said .
“
Yeah , well , if you want to try the middle ground of making her brain go dark without breaking her head open , you go right ahead , ” Tristan said .
“
Let ’s not fight , please , ” Sveta said .   
She looked at the thrashing woman .   
“ Shit .
” I flew to the woman .   
It took me a second of wrestling with her before I could get my hands around her throat .   
Her hands reached beneath my sleeves and got a few scratches in at my forearm .
I shifted my grip , and I choked her , heels of my hands pressing in .   
I pulled away when she went limp and the struggling ceased .   
Unconscious , not dead .
I did n’t need to ask before orange motes began to appear .   
Restraints , so she would n’t hurt herself .
“ You ’ll need to stay with your friends , ”
I said , to the guy with the goatee .
He nodded , slumping to a sitting position on the ground .   
He did n’t even seem to care he was sitting in mud .
Tristan walked away , and Sveta and I both followed .
“
Where ’s our fourth ?
” I asked .
“
Sent him ahead .   
He ’s out there and he ’ll change soon , ” Tristan said .   
He pointed .   
North and deeper into the woods .   
Chris would be closer to the Patrol block guys , then .
Good enough .
We were wordless from that point on .   
We cut through the woods , and we reached their edge , where tree stumps of varying height speared up from the ground .
Across the clearing were hills with stones piled up around them , no doubt cleared from the fields , and houses , large but rustic .   
Two of those houses were on fire , and one had been partially leveled .
A blip of something green shot from the sky to the ground , far enough away it felt like it was on the horizon , when it was really on the far side of the settlement .   
The ground shook where we were in response .
If that was n’t indicator enough of where the focus of the fighting was , I could hear the distant shriek of Ashley ’s power .   
I made eye contact with Sveta , then Capricorn .
Hostages .   
Guns .   
Turning allies into pawns .   
Inflicting something that serious on someone ?
No games here .   
No illusions of any games , even .
For all the issues of our motley team , where so often we could have three people on entirely different pages , I could look at Sveta and I could look at Tristan , and I could know they understood this .   
The Fallen in particular had gone off the deep end .   
They ’d abandoned their last vestiges of responsibility as capes and as human beings .








A fence gave us cover as we made our way to the nearest house .   
It had been damaged earlier in the skirmish , to the point that a third of the house was missing , part of the ground floor and part of the upper floor .   
A good chunk of that part of the building was strewn over the small field behind the house .
The ongoing fight was still far away .   
I could hear gunfire and see periodic light shows .   
I would have liked to take a hand in things , but I did n’t want to break from the plan to work the edges of the scene .   
The innocents first .   
Evacuation .
“
Hey !
”
Capricorn called out .   
“ Civilians ?
”
“
Try us and see !
” was the response , coming down from above .   
The man was upstairs .
Capricorn looked over at Sveta and I , giving us a dumbfounded shrug .
“
We ’re good guys !
” Sveta called out .   
“
We ’re evacuating people who are n’t part of the fight !
”
“
Yeah ?
”
“
We ’ll tell you where to go .   
There are people in uniform waiting at the edge of the woods .   
They ’ll take you somewhere safe , ” Sveta said .
There was a murmured conversation between the people on the upper floor .   
I could only hear the sound of it .   
Worried , tense , a word that might have been a swear word from the guy .
“ We were stranded up here .   
Stairs got trashed , and floor looks unsteady , ” the guy said .   
“
We ’ll take that offer if you help us down .
”
Someone else upstairs spoke to the guy , voice tense and urgent .
“ We can do that , ” Sveta said .
The voices upstairs went quiet .
“ I could use my power to secure the building , ” Capricorn said .   
“ Making it permanent would mean taking the barricades I made between here and either getting rid of them or making them permanent too .
”
I looked back .   
As we ’d made our way between the forest and the first house , Capricorn had erected short walls for cover against gunfire .   
Some cut into field and road .
It seemed like such a simple thing , but it said a lot about our presence here and what we were doing .   
The more walls , the safer the route for people to follow as they evacuated , but it also made life harder for anyone who came back here to live in the settlement again .   
With some of the walls edging into the road , it also created the low - level risk that if Hollow Point was going to end the attack and leave , they ’d have a hard time getting out .
Did we want to burn their bridge behind our enemies , when they were fighting something bigger and nastier ?   
The best case scenario here was that the Fallen were neutralized and Hollow Point was left without any true merits to their name .   
Setting up Hollow Point to find there was n’t a place to run to ?   
To die ?   
Worse ?
No .   
Not when I ’d seen the breaker woman go through the ‘ worse’ .
“
Can you clear away the walls near the road ?
” I asked .
Capricorn nodded .
He started toward the edge of the broken wall , so he ’d be able to see what he was working on .   
I put my hand out , flat against the front of his armor , stopping him .
The people upstairs were too quiet .   
After the tense conversation among the members up there , the silence felt off .
I checked to make sure the ongoing fighting was still far away and that our flanks were clear of trouble , put the forcefield up and ventured out first .
At the edge of the broken floor , a pair of men were crouching .   
What seemed to be two families were gathered in the room behind them , peering through the door .   
The men and their wives looked more like older teens or twenty - ish , and the kids I could see were four or five .
The floor was shattered , that section of the upstairs open to the outdoors .   
Slats of the floor that had n’t been broken when the damage had been done now stabbed out into open air .
“ I can bring the kids down , ” I said .
“ My wife first , ” the older of the two guys said .   
“
She ’ll look after them as you bring them down .
”
“
Sure , ” I said .
Behind me , Capricorn ventured out .   
He began drawing the motes .   
I watched how the younger of the two guys kept his eyes on Capricorn , then leaned forward a bit , floor creaking under him , as he tried to peer down at the orange lights and the outlined trails .
A narrow young woman with brown hair and a red bandanna at her neck ventured forward along the more intact portions of the floor .   
She hesitated , looking at the guy I presumed was her husband , a blond guy with peach fuzz facial hair and greasy , medium - length hair combed into a fauxhawk .   
He had tattoos at his neck and at the backs of his hands .
“ Go on , ” he said .
She ventured forward .   
The damaged floor creaked ominously , and she stopped .
I flew closer to her , one eye on the two men .
“
I ’ve got you ,
” I said , taking her wrists in my hands .
Her husband reached behind his back and drew a handgun as I focused on making sure I had a grip .   
I could have reacted , but I did n’t , focusing on the woman instead .   
He leveled the weapon at my head .
“
I ’m trying to help you and your family , ” I said .
“ You ’re going to help us ,
yeah ,
” he said .   
“
You ’re going to stay with me , and your friend down there is going to do what I say .
”
This was n’t an auspicious start .
“
You alright , Victoria ?
” Capricorn asked .
“
I ’m fine ,
” I said .   
I verified the wife would n’t fall if I let go , then released her wrists .   
She backed away .
The guy did n’t seem to like how unbothered I seemed .   
I was worried , I knew what might happen if he fired two bullets , and if he panicked , he might empty the gun at me .   
I ’d had someone do that , once .
Downstairs , Capricorn picked his way across the shattered floorboards and bits of roof as he walked backward .
“
You stay , ” the guy with the fauxhawk and the gun said .
Capricorn looked off to his left .
He was looking at Sveta .   
That worked .
The wife with the red bandanna ushered the kids further into the room .   
She shut the door .
Just the two men , Capricorn and I.
And , faster than I ’d expected , Sveta at an open window , past a door into another room upstairs .
“
You ’re going to go run off that way , armor boy , staying where I can see you until you ’re a speck in the distance , ” the man with the gun said .   
“ Direction of the big house .   
It got trashed , but there should be people around there .   
I want you to report some things , starting with the fact we ’re holed up here , and the attacking group went past us .   
We can get them from behind .   
Got it ?   
Then you ’re going to come back the same way and report-
” I met Sveta ’s eyes and nodded .
“
-to us .   
Why are you nodding , bitch ?
” the man asked .
Sveta ’s hand went out .   
She missed the gun , but stopped extending her arm .   
It came to rest on his arm , fingers hooking over the top , and pulled it back and away .
Wretch up , I flew into the floor beneath the man ’s feet .   
Already damaged , it broke further , the floor under him becoming a slope .
I reached out to catch , and got my hand around the gun .   
He fell the rest of the way , his hands out , wrists catching the worst of the impact on uneven ground .   
He fell to his side a moment later , groaning .   
The timing of the fall was weirdly off , but only because he ’d had to figure out how to pull back and not be resting his upper body weight on two injured wrists .
The other guy put his hands up .
“
Can you do cuffs ?
”
I asked Capricorn .
“ I can .   
I can splint , while I ’m at it , ” he said .   
He bent down by the guy .   
“
If I do it wrong , though , it ’s going to be fifteen pounds of rock hanging off of those hands of yours .   
You going to cooperate ?
”
The guy on the ground below spat .
“
Yeah .   
Big man .   
Keep those arms still , ” Capricorn said .   
He gave me a look , eyes visible behind the eyeholes of his helm .
The door cracked open .   
The woman peered out .
“
Do we need to worry about you too ?
”
I asked her .
“
No .   
Are you still offering that way out ?
”
“
Yeah .   
Come on , hurry up , ” I said .
“
Sorry my husband ’s an asshole , ” she said .
“ Mom , ” the kid behind her said .
“
He is , ” she said .   
“
Do n’t be like your dad , okay ?
”
Good enough , I supposed .
I flew her down to the ground , then flew the kids two at a time .   
The second wife and then the man were last .   
We led them back and away , and the gunman with his lower arms encased in a single growth of stone was last .
I imagined he could use that stone as a makeshift weapon if he had a mind to , but it was hard to picture him being very effective that way , especially when possibly broken wrists were encased in the middle .   
Knee - buckling pain , I imagined .
I was n’t sure if Capricorn had similar reservations , but he withdrew a bit of cord from his belt , and he used orange motes to fix one end to the cuffs and another bit to the guy
’s belt .   
He steered the guy with one hand at his shoulder .
Sveta came around the corner of the house .   
She put out one hand , and I slapped her hand with mine , holding it for a moment in a victory squeeze .
This ?   
As melancholy as everything else could be , I liked this .
“ You ’re leaving .   
We ’re going to head that way , ” I said , indicating the path we ’d made , with the walls for cover .   
“
Any advice on where to go ?   
Houses with children ?
”
“ Most houses have children or people under eighteen , ” the wife said , guiding her kids much like Capricorn guided her errant husband .   
“
The red house .   
Abby looks after some of the children when the parents go to war or go into the city .
”
“
Do they have weapons ?
” Capricorn asked .
“
Of course .   
We hunt deer and rabbit when we can .
”
“
The leadership ’s house is totally gone , ” the other woman observed .   
“
They hit it first .
”
I looked in the direction she was facing .   
At the corner of the camp , near the point where the road disappeared into the forest , one of the larger houses had been leveled .
On the alert for any drawn weapons , I caught the man putting his hand on his wife ’s arm .   
She looked down .
I hated that .   
I had n’t seen it often , over the years , but it got under my skin when I did .   
From the time I was young , my mom had drawn attention to those things after the fact , when we did some crisis point stuff , responding to domestic violence calls , or when she introduced me to a police detective and his wife she knew .   
She ’d remark on the dynamics between husband and wife , the power plays , and the signs that something else was going on .   
The intent was to make me aware , and to ensure I ’d avoid those same things when I got into a relationship .
“ If we send these guys out to the people at the edge of the forest , will you stick with us ?
”
I asked the wife .   
“ I do n’t want to repeat this thing with having to fight you guys to help you .
”
She looked at the other woman .   
“
You ’ll look after my kids ?
”
“
Of course .
”
“
She ’s my sister , ” the wife said .   
“
If she ’s got my kids , then I ’m
okay giving you directions .
”
“
Go , ” Capricorn said .   
He gave the one guy a shove .   
“
Straight line that way .   
They ’re not going to arrest you unless you cause trouble .
”
“
Do n’t be an asshole , Tony , ” the wife said .   
“ If you did break your wrists , you ’re going to need someone to wipe your tush .   
I ’ve told you before , I ’ll only make your life easy if you return the favor .
”
“
Fuck off , ” Tony said , with an exhausted sort of emphasis on ‘ off’ .   
“ We ’re going .   
I ’m getting away from Nan .
”
“
Yeah , ” the other guy said .
The family made their way .   
They ducked low by the walls , and Tony had to squat and waddle in way I found a little amusing , his knees apart and hands down .
“
Nan ?
”
I asked the wife .
“
Yeah .   
Short for Nancy .
”
“
Alright , ” I said .   
“
You ’re good , here ?   
I do n’t need to worry about you ?
”
“ Family first , friends second , Fallen and faith third , ” she said .   
“ If this is what we ’re having to deal with here , I do n’t want it .   
I ’ll help you get some others I know out .
”
Right .   
It was n’t because it was ‘ right’ , but because of her specific priorities .   
Something to be careful of .
“ We ran into someone who wigged out , full sanity breakdown , ” Capricorn said .   
“
Same with you ?
”
“ Not with me .   
I ’m
… background .   
I ca n’t say much more .
”
“
Yeah , we got the same from them , too , ” he said .   
“ Come on .
”
Anyone who was anything had a gun to their heads , it sounded like .   
The people with powers , the people who ’d come in to help were now obligated to , and nobody seemed willing or able to elaborate on particulars .
It made me nervous .   
The idea of the brain - fucking stuff bothered me more than the shackled guy turning into the Wretch - like flesh puddle , back in the woods .   
My heart did n’t race , but each pound of it felt monumental and heavy in my chest .
We made our way to the next house .   
It was more intact than the last , but getting to it without risking being shot by anyone in the windows was tricky .   
Too much open space between buildings .
The woman pulled off her bandanna , then held it over her head , venturing into the open space .   
Nobody shot .   
She approached the house , and the side door opened .   
A middle - aged man met her on the extended stairs that acted as a kind of porch .
She beckoned for us to approach .   
I decided to do it , because I had my defenses .
I was very aware that the sound of the ongoing confrontation had changed .   
Things had moved closer .   
It was hard to map out just where people were , because the camp had a more village - like settlement stabbing through the lower half of it , dense enough to block the view of the streets and the far side .   
The settlement was densest in the southeast , closer to the road and the ‘ big house’ .   
There were more scattered houses and fields to the north and west .   
Those would be harder to reach .
I flew to the house , landed on the grass , and walked to the porch .   
Arriving directly at the porch could be seen as threatening .
“
What ’s on the far side of the trees ?
” the middle - aged guy asked .   
He had a salt - and - pepper beard and broad shoulders .   
He looked like a farm worker , with tattoos that would ’ve been fit for a sailor if they had been less biblical and more nautical .
“ People in uniform , ” I said .   
“
They ’re armed , but they ’ll only shoot if they see weapons .   
You should leave yours behind .
”
He glanced at Nan .
“
They ’ll guard you , and they wo n’t arrest you , ” I said , firmly .
“ You say .   
We do n’t have guarantees .
”
“ You do n’t , ” I said .   
“
But as much as people do n’t like you guys as a whole , people have no grudge with you and the amnesty holds until you ’re charged with something .   
Only the ones in charge are a concern , and that ’s mostly because that ’s how they handled this whole thing .
”
“
It ’s cute
you think that , ” he said .   
“
We never had fair treatment , and I do n’t think we ’re going to get it now .
”
“ We ’re here .   
Some of our people are risking getting shot , even by some of you guys .   
Do you want to be treated fair ?   
Take the help that ’s offered .
”
“ If we want to be treated fair , the only sure way is to rely on each other , ” he said .   
“
That ’s not saying we wo n’t listen to you , but I ’m not sure , here .
”
I set my jaw , lips pressing together momentarily , because the alternative was that they ’d part
and I ’d say something .   
I did n’t like these guys .   
I did n’t respect what they were about .
“
Tony and Nan
’s sister left , ” I said .   
“ They did n’t have as much of a problem with it .
”
“ Tony had a brain infection when he was young , and he was never that right after , ” the guy said .
“
He ’s nice to look at , though , ” a woman said , from the background .
“
Mm , ” Nan grunted .   
She sighed .   
“
You guys were the first I came to , to let you know .   
I thought that was right of me .   
Do me a favor ?   
Let these people go on their way .   
They can collect the … ones who are scared .
”
“
The less loyal , ” the woman from before said , from behind the guy with the salt and pepper beard .
“
We ’re not all soldiers , Mare , ” Nan said , and her voice was hard .   
“
Some have kids and they wo n’t know what to do except run or lose their minds .   
Houses are falling down .   
Mine
’s gone , Tony and my bed , even .   
It makes sense to run , I think .   
That does n’t mean we ’re disloyal .   
It means we ’re fucking trying to survive .
”
“
Fighting ’s tilting this way , ” the guy said .   
“
I think the intruders are coming here .   
We ’re going to hold the line , make sure they ca n’t retreat back this way .   
You want to go ?   
Go .   
You come back after .
”
“ I ’m not going to fucking disappear on you , Enoch .   
I ’m a believer .   
I ’ve put up with Tony , for fuck ’s sake , from the end of the world to the hereafter .   
Four months , I dragged him and two kids around until I found you all again .   
Why would I leave now ?
”
“
How should I know what squirrely thoughts you have in your head , Nan ?   
If you ’re going , then fuck off .   
The fighting ’s getting closer .   
You do n’t have long .
”
“
I can take the kids if you want .   
Get them out of your hair .
”
“ You can fuck right off , ”
Enoch said .
I folded my arms .
“
Enoch , ” the woman from before said .   
“
Let ’em .   
We had one of the little ones with a bullet in his mouth , twenty minutes ago .   
They were suckling on the thing .   
Nan ’s right .   
They ’re in the way .
”
“
The little ones .   
Maise and Jake can stay .   
Maise is ten and she can hold a rifle .   
Jake ’s a decent shot .
”
“
You ’re insisting on staying ?
” I asked .
“ I said what I said .   
I ’m playing nice here .   
If you want to be a hardass on this , I can be less nice .
”
I hated these guys .
“
Get the kids , ” Nan said .
I backed away , and waited for Nan to round the people up .   
Capricorn had created a barricade that intersected the fence around the field , blocking some of the path too .   
He and Sveta knelt by it .
“
They ’re rounding up some kids , ” I said .   
“
A good size group is inside .   
Guy called Enoch .   
They ’ve got some kids in there , and they ’re going to start shooting if Hollow Point shows their faces .
”
I heard a distant holler that might have been Beast of Burden .   
The fact they were close enough for me to hear- “ Fighting is trending this way , ” Capricorn said .   
“
Sounds like that might happen soon .
”
“ Victoria , you worded that like the kids were going to be doing the shooting , ” Sveta said .
“ Some are .   
The very young are getting evacuated .   
I ’ll go back and get more info , but there are kids Kenzie ’s age and younger with guns in their hands and parents expecting them to shoot .
”
“
No , ” Sveta said .   
“
No , that ’s not right .
”
“
No , ” I agreed .   
“
Do you think you can do anything about it , Capricorn ?
”
“ Without tipping them off ?
” he asked .   
He looked at the building .   
“ Shit .   
I ’d need to keep an eye on things and stay close .
”
Meaning we ’d be close to any fighting that erupted and we ’d have to deal with Enoch ’s group if they found a way out and happened to be pissed off .
A stray bullet clipped the side of the house , twenty feet from us .   
I huffed out the half - breath I ’d intended to use to say something .
“
Do it , ” I said .   
I flew over to the house .   
Nan was gathering the kids .   
Some had bags .
“ We ’re ready .
”
“ Through the woods .   
Keep going as straight as you can .   
There are more hero capes to the far north , you do n’t want to go that way .   
Too far east
and you might run into the villains as they back out .   
Northeast .
” Nan nodded .
“ They ’ll take you into custody and keep you safe .   
What other houses here do I need to go to ?
”
“
Three houses down , ” she indicated .   
“
Tony ’s
cousin .   
There ’ll be kids .
”
I had n’t missed what she ’d said earlier .   
The friends and family thing .   
She protected her own , and her advice was suspect for that reason .   
“
What about the houses between here and there ?   
Empty ?
”
“ One should be empty .   
Last night it was all soldiers , and they ’re off fighting , or they should be .   
House with the sheets hanging on the line is only one person .   
She does the services some days .   
It ’s not worth the time or effort , the cranky bitch never listens to anyone .
”
Yeah .   
There we were .
“
Tony ’s
cousin .   
What can I tell them , that they ’ll think it ’s from you ?
”
“
Tell him Nan said Tony ’s gon na need him .
”
“
Alright , ” I said .   
“ Go .   
I ’ll handle it .
”
Sveta hauled herself over the fence , then approached so she stood a distance away .   
As Nan began getting the kids and one man that looked to be about seventy on their way , Sveta guided them , bending low and giving the kids instructions on where to go .
Most looked back to Nan for guidance , and she urged them on .
“ Vic !
”
Capricorn called out .
I turned his way .
“
When they get to the woods , have ’em call for Self - reflection !
”
“ Nan , ” I said .
There were sixteen kids , and Nan was still near the door , urging them on .   
She had some of the young ones stay close to her , and when someone slightly older came out , she paired them up , clasping their hands together , before sending them on their way .   
She had to take ten or so seconds to get kids sorted before she could spare a moment to respond to me .
“
What ?
”
“ When you get to the woods , call out ‘ reflection’ , loud as you can .
”
“
Why ?
”
“
Because like you said to Tony , we ’re helping you , so help us a bit .   
This only helps you guys where it counts .
”
She frowned a bit , but she nodded .
I took flight , leaving things to Sveta and Nan .
The ‘ cranky’ woman ’s place first .   
I flew to the door , and knocked , hard .   
The mailbox had only ‘ Sims’ on it .   
No number .
“
What ?
” the answer came from within .
“
I ’m a hero from out of town .   
We ’re evacuating people .   
Fighting ’s coming this way .
”
The door opened .   
The woman was older , but not as old as I ’d expected .   
Her hair was black , with streaks of white running through it .   
Her clothing style was very severe , much of the neck covered , sleeves to the wrists , dress to the ankle .   
She looked me over , staring through the screen door .
“ If you want to go , there are people waiting .   
Some buildings have been knocked down .   
It could happen here .
”
“ Who else is going ?
”
“
Nan ’s family , I ’ll be talking to Tony ’s cousin next door in a second .
”
“ Screws loose , all of them , ” she said .   
“
The nonsense they spew , the criminal stuff .   
It ’s all madness .
”
“ You can get out , ” I said .   
“
Just head into the woods , go straight
, it ’s not
that thick a patch of woods , and there are people on the other side .   
They ’ll take care of you .
”
“ I ’ll go , ” she said .   
“ Thank you .
”
“
Of course , ” I said .
Before I could go , she grabbed my wrist .   
Her fingers were bony .
“ I ’ve got others to help , ” I said .
“
There ’s right
and there ’s wrong ,
” she said .   
“
You can do everything right , moment by moment , and still end up on the wrong side , too beaten down to fight things anymore .
”
Why this ?   
Why now ?   
I had the feeling
it was more of a confession than advice .   
She was n’t Fallen , not at heart ?   
She ’d just … ended up here ?
How the hell did that happen ?
Maybe that in itself was the confession .
“ I ’ve been beaten down before , ” I said .   
“
I ’ll find a way to keep fighting .   
Humans are resilient .   
We made it through Gold Morning .
”
“
It ’s very easy to lose sight of how beaten down you are , ” she said .   
“
Do n’t let the little things slide .   
We have to be vigilant .
”
“ We do , ” I said .   
“
Part of my vigilance is making sure those kids survive .   
I need to go next door .   
If you want help getting out , ask for a guy called Gilpatrick , okay ?   
He ’s one of the best people I know , and his whole job is knowing and providing resources to people who need it .
”
She looked back at her house .   
She released my wrist and pulled the door closed , drawing herself up taller .
“
Bless , ” she said .   
“
Many of these people do not deserve to be saved .
” I could have responded .   
I decided to keep my mouth shut .   
I wanted her to go
so I could help others , not to get caught in a conversation .
Ducking low , she ran across the field , and I flew between her and the worst of the fighting with the wretch out , to provide a bit of a shield .
At the edge of the settlement , where the buildings were thinning out , there was a thick cloud of black smoke .    
Beast of Burden was there , and Damsel was standing behind him , using him as a shield .   
I could see the spidery form of Nailbiter and I could make out crackles of lightning backed by dark smoke , along the dirt road and a nearby lean - to or outhouse .   
There were some gunshots , and I could hear the revving of more bikes .
I flew to the next house .   
Someone was already on the porch , watching me and the distant fighting .   
No gun pointed at me , only a look of worry from a guy with a high forehead and blond hair that really needed combing .   
He had a boy with him , a bit younger than Kenzie , just as blond , just as disheveled , hair - wise .   
No tattoos
–
I would n’t have known him for Fallen if I ’d seen him on the street .   
They looked like their clothes and even their bodies badly needed washing , like both were homeless , despite having a fairly large farmhouse to reside in .
“
Nan says Tony needs you , ” I said .   
“
You need to get going .   
Through the forest , people are waiting .   
Do n’t take any guns , or you might get yourself or your kid shot .
”
He asked something , his voice a mumble , as if his lack of self - care extended to not even bothering to form coherent words .
“
What ?
”
“ Tony went ?
” the kid interpreted .
“
Yeah , ” I said .
That was reason enough for them to go .   
They took nothing except themselves , and they stuck close together .
The fact that people were streaming from houses to the woods seemed to be cause for others to take the same route .   
Three teenagers were running for it , now .   
A girl with brown - blonde hair ran , guitar bouncing at her back .   
There were two teenage boys , younger , with dark hair .   
They ran to intercept Tony ’s cousin and the boy , maybe to get answers .
These were people Rain had lived with , seen every day .   
This place , down to the guy who silenced his wife with a touch , the old woman , the people who did n’t take care of themselves , it had been his existence and the building blocks of experience
he ’d had to use to pull himself together .
No sign of Erin .   
I did want to help her .
There were gunshots , close .   
The people at Enoch ’s house were shooting .   
I could see the orange motes around the building , still weaving their way around and up .
I flew in that direction , going higher to stay away from any likely stray bullets .   
Over the ‘ Sims’ house , over the empty house , then to the roof , where the peak would provide some cover .   
Sveta and Capricorn were staying close together on the ground by the barricade .   
Sveta peered over it .   
Capricorn sat with his back to it , facing the house .
More gunshots from within .
Tristan had his hand clenched into a fist .   
He opened it , and the points of light and traceries took form .   
The building was wreathed in stone , blocking the windows and doors and shielding it from gunfire .
The job was done , and Sveta and Capricorn both moved away from house and barricade , getting closer to the fighting , dropping down from the path to the field .   
The dirt for the dirt road to this row of houses had been piled up , so the water would run off the sides , with stones rolled over to separate the looser dirt from the fields .   
The two of them stayed closer to the stone divider , hunkering down so the hump of road provided some protection .
The people in the house were n’t happy .
We ’d have to protect it .   
We ’d assumed that responsibility .
I peered around the peak of the building as the people drew near enough
I could see their costumes in detail .
Beast of Burden was constantly backing up as others advanced .
A guy with the proportions of an older teenager that had n’t quite grown to match his lanky frame was advancing , arms out to his sides .   
A hood of what looked like flesh was wrapped around a hard mask or helmet .   
It looked like two human faces with distorted features had been cut away from their owner ’s heads , carved into strips , and then bound together , with gaps in both the skin - strips and helmet for him to peer through .   
A ‘ mouth’ yawned open around one eye , and a diagonal slash of a gap between two other strips provided an opening for the other .   
His eyes were blue sparks of light .
I could see the range of his power .   
He was the source of the dark smoke and blue arcs of lightning that danced over every surface , Beast of Burden included .   
Everything in his field of view was affected , and wooden fences , weeds , and bits of wood on the road sparked and ignited .   
Things closer to him seemed more affected .   
At about thirty meters , the effect seemed negligible .
Nailbiter backed away , moving with some agitation as her pointed feet stuck into the softer dirt of the road , her mobility hampered .   
Light arced briefly and fiercely between two of her extended fingers , and she shook her hand .
I could see Sidepiece and Disjoint as part of the group .   
Beast of Burden
’s clique , separated from Prancer
’s and now matched in number .
There were other Fallen .   
A young woman , with a face - concealing hood and scarf that was wound around her hair and down her back , voluminous sleeves around her arms , and no actual torso section to her costume .   
A black belt at her chest covered only what was essential , and tattoos decorated the tanned skin of her stomach and sides .   
She was guarding the one with the electric sight .
Evacuating the innocents in the camp was one step .   
Chances were that they ’d go back to the Fallen after .   
There was no way to get them to cooperate and refuse them that freedom , and the amnesty , as much as it sucked , protected them , even if their leaders were apparently breaking rules .
Anarchy was the word , really .   
We had to deal with the really problematic ones .
Fallen - aligned capes on dirt bikes tore around a corner , kicking up dust behind them as they joined the fray .   
Some of that dust reached up to the edges of roofs on two story buildings behind them .   
Hoodlums , tattooed and wearing cheap demon masks .   
Boys and girls .
Maybe they were older than I was , but it was hard to see them and assign any kind of maturity .   
I could hear them whooping as they split up , half of them racing along the right perimeter the darkness and electricity , half along the left perimeter .
The first of them hit the edge of the dirt road Beast of Burden was on , using it as a ramp to go airborne .   
Others followed suit .   
They sailed to either side of Beast of Burden
’s group , landed in fields and skidded around
so they were behind the group , facing Damsel .
Nailbiter reached out .   
Her fingers struck one of the last bikers to jump .   
They collided with the thin bars and she drew her fingers back to normal size .   
The withdrawing and the motion against the biker ’s front created slashes at the face , collarbone , chest , and lower stomach .   
The last looked deep .
Sidepiece , too , clawed her navel away from her midsection in an effort that took a second tug to separate some strings of still - connected skin , and then hurled that flesh to strike the ground a moment before the biker landed .   
It detonated , and the biker bounced to the ground ten feet from their vehicle .
Our side joined the fight .   
Sveta yanked another one off of their bike .   
Blue lights began appearing around the larger group as Capricorn started using Byron ’s power .
I took to the sky , trying to get a better sense of the battlefield .
Prancer was n’t that far away .   
I could see people
I was pretty sure were Speedrunners .   
Prancer ’s crew had guns , and they were shooting blind , because a power was obscuring their view of the street and things beyond .   
Fallen were moving to flank .
On the very far side of the confrontation where Prancer was involved , I could see the distortion of Vista ’s power .
We ’d help this group first .   
I looked for a good place to dive .   
I could drop down by lightning - eyes , but I was n’t sure about the hooded girl .
Besides , it seemed like he was keeping Beast of Burden tied down .
Fallen dirt - bikers first .
Beast of Burden
’s group second .
I dropped down at a point more or less between one dirt - biking Fallen and Nailbiter , standing so I could see both .
The Fallen in front of me raised a hand .   
A deep black ellipse appeared at his fingertips , above his head .
I could feel what he was doing , as the air seemed to leave the ‘ room’ .
A black hole ?   
No .   
Nothing non - gaseous seemed to be getting drawn in .   
But my intake of breath felt thin , as if it supplied far too little .
“ Whoooooo !
”
he called out , and the cry was distorted and magnified by the dark blob he held overhead .   
He revved his bike and charged me .
I moved to meet him , holding my breath
so I would n’t lose any .   
The blob had an effect like my aura , but it was physical , changing the rules of the area around him , not anything emotional , and he seemed to have nuanced control .   
His buddies were n’t suffering .
I met his ambient effect with my own .   
As he drew nearer , I pushed out with my aura , hard .
I saw him waver .   
On the other side of me , Nailbiter ’s mouth yawned open , and her teeth speared out , criss - crossing , stabbing into dirt , field , stone , and toward the biker and me .   
I was already flying back and out of the way .
The guy threw his arm down .   
The blob crashed into the road , and the bike rode the explosion as the effect released , taking to the air .
Her hand went out .   
She caught him out of the air with extended fingers , and let the bike fall while she held him in the air .
She flicked her arm , hand going out .   
As before , the rapid slide of finger against flesh had the effect of a serrated knife edge .   
He was cut five different ways , and he crashed into the ground not far in front of lightning - eyes .
The guy screamed and convulsed as the effect crackled over him , burning skin and setting his hair on fire .
A dirt biker with a demon mask with red rips and gouges in pure white latex ‘ skin’ drew a submachine gun , aiming it at Damsel .   
Sveta grabbed his weapon , but failed to disarm him , as he maintained his grip .
Instead , the biker with the white mask turned ghostly .   
The ghostly image separated .   
Several bikers now , each with variants on the theme , red mask with radioactive green gouges and blood , and a blue and yellow mask with red gouges and blood .
All three had guns , and Sveta had only two hands .
Capricorn ’s image of blue lines and sparks came into being .   
Water sprayed , violent and focused largely outward at the bikers .   
Where it cascaded into the road , it left gouges of mud .   
Beast of Burden stumbled as one spray caught him from behind .
Ashley was already using the distraction to move .   
She fired her power , directing it at the road , and launched herself into the air , dress and hair fluttering behind her .   
The multifacted biker tried to get a bead on her , arms raised to shield eyes from spraying water , and she shot again , changing direction in the air .
“ Damsel ! ”
Beast barked .   
“ I told you to not fucking shoot
that so close to me !
”
I was already flying toward the multifacted Fallen bikers .   
I used my aura to distract , and closed the distance , Wretch around me .
Had someone been paying attention , they might have noticed the water tracing the edges of the Wretch .
There was that melancholy feeling again .
I closed the distance , and as it happened , so did Damsel .   
I came at them from the northern end and she came at them from the southern side .   
The one of the three that had a gun free turned to aim at Damsel .
She shot with her power before he could pull the trigger , and crashed bodily into him .
He split into another set of varieties .   
Yellow - green , green - red , and purple - green .   
Two of them drew knives .   
One of the others was joining the fray too .
I could see how wide Damsel ’s eyes were , and I could see her lips move .
Her hand went out , and she blasted .   
The two in the range of the blast were quick enough to dodge away , and they did n’t move quite like humans anymore .   
Too fast , too jerky .
“ Damsel ! ”
Sidepiece called out .   
“
Get clear !
” Damsel blasted , aiming at the ground with both hands and firing with both , kicking up dust and debris , and catching the front of the motorcycle , shredding it .
The things avoided that blast as well , but as she moved skyward ,
Nailbiter and Sidepiece both went on the offensive .   
Sidepiece threw two chunks , and Nailbiter clawed out .
Several of the things seemed to die .   
Others folded back into each other , and used the momentum of that reabsorption to leap backward .   
They scrambled for the bike that had been abandoned when Sidepiece screwed up the rider ’s landing .
I could see Damsel panting hard .
“
Wretches !
”
she howled the words .   
“ Scum of the earth !   
You do not deserve the breath you draw !
”
She was going to go over the top on them , and I was n’t sure she was going to hold back or be just bark with no bite .   
Not like she had during the test skirmish or the train ride with Presley .
“ Damsel !
”
I called out .
She wheeled on me .   
I saw her eyes widen as I dove .
I put my hand at her neck and another at her arm .
Carrying her , I flew her back and away from the fight .
I could hear the sound of Byron ’s power going off again , cutting into the earth , but my focus was on Ashley ’s eyes beneath the black mask , lacking any pupil .   
Her lips were parted to show teeth , and it was n’t a smile .
Off to the side , her fingers opened , spreading .
She fired her power into the air .   
I was flying , carrying her , and with the blast , we were forced off course .   
We hit the soft dirt at the edge of the dirt road and landed in a heap together .
I could have sworn at her , I could have been pissed .
It was n’t worth it .
“
Hi , ” I said .   
We were far enough away we would n’t be overheard by others .
She pressed her lips together .   
Her hand went to my neck , like I held hers .   
Her fingers felt like real flesh should , but they were cooler than fingers should be .
“
This is an act , remember ?
”
“
I ’m all out of patience , ” she said .   
“
I ’m ready to kill someone .
”
At the hospital , I ’d dealt with a tinker who had the freak - out rants .   
I ’d dealt with people with distorted views of reality .   
Mostly I ’d dealt as an observer , sitting in for the group therapy .   
I ’d thought about what I wanted to say , cringed when people said the wrong things , and I ’d written emails to support them or give advice after the fact .   
Glacially , slowly .
I wanted to handle this in a way that would n’t have any observers cringing .
“
Let ’s not , ” I said .   
“
We ’re making progress here , okay ?   
Mission is going mostly according to plan , and you ’re handling your bit well .   
People are over - the - top amazed at how well you ’re selling this .   
Keep it a sale .   
Keep it an act .   
It ’s good .
”
She exhaled , like she ’d been holding in a breath or ten .   
I felt her fingers relax at my neck .
“
You ’re pissing him off ?
” I asked .
“
He ’s pissing me off , ” she said .   
“
But I ’m getting to him .
”
“
Good , ” I said .
“ Damsel ! ”
Sidepiece called out , drawing out the first sound into a longer ‘ damn’ sound .   
“ If you ’re done making out , we could use some help !
”
Some of the bikers that had been tossed from their rides were on their feet .   
Lightning - eyes was pressuring Beast of Burden , forcing him into that plodding , slow retreat .
“ Ca n’t off her without risking her tearing my head off in a death - spasm !
”
Damsel called out .
“
Suck it up and figure it out !
”
Sidepiece called out .
“
So annoying , ” Damsel hissed .
A bike revved .   
I could hear the approach .
Damsel and I separated as it rode up the sloped side of the dirt road .   
She blasted to create more distance for herself , and caught the edge of the bike ’s tire .
The blast served to throw the bike out from under the girl who ’d been riding it .   
The girl landed , skidding across dirt that had been packed by the passage of countless vehicles .
“ Stay down , ” I said , as the Fallen girl started to get to her hands and feet .   
I pushed out with my aura .
She gave up , collapsing face down onto the road .
Did she even have powers ?   
Did this particular group mix up those that did with those that did n’t ?   
What a hassle .
Byron had directed most of his power at the road for the second blast .   
It hampered Beast of Burden
’s footing , and it dissolved a chunk of the road .   
Sveta , as was her tendency , was lurking , looking for an opportunity to reach out .
Crackling with lightning , Beast of Burden called something out- and Nailbiter snatched up two bikes , one damaged , that the convoy of Fallen had been riding .   
She hurled them at Beast of Burden , and he caught one with each hand .
Pressing them together into a makeshift shield , he charged at the lightning - eyes Fallen .   
He made it nearly to the guy before the girl with the hood reached up and out .   
Giant hands wrapped in black rags materialized between Beast of Burden and the two Fallen .
Beast of Burden pressed on .   
Another hand materialized , grabbing him , and he carried on forward , metal treads scraping through mud .
Disjoint danced out to the side , practically skipping as he went from mud to solid ground , and slashed out with one hand , his hand disappearing .
The woman with the hood fell , and she might have been grabbed by the same hand .   
The hands disappeared , and Beast of Burden was momentarily reduced to only darkness and electricity as he took the brunt of the blast from lightning - eyes , even with the two motorcycles as an intervening barrier .
He brought a motorcycle down as a club , and he swatted the Fallen guy with the vision power .   
Then he brought the other bike down , hitting the girl who ’d been thrown aside twice with overhead smashes .
The lesser Fallen who remained did n’t have much fight in them .
Beast of Burden
’s horned head swiveled to look at us .   
I flew back and away , so I ’d have a good view of things .
“ Beast of Burden , ” I called out .   
“ Bob
. ”
He hurled a motorcycle at me .   
He was a distance away , but he was strong .    
Twenty feet above the road , I flew to one side to evade .
Grudges .   
Even if we had the same enemy , he was n’t willing to even talk .
He threw another bike .   
This one was more on - target .   
I flew to evade , and saw motion in the corner of my eye .   
Nailbiter .
Sveta grabbed my arm , tugged , but with my flight not moving me in that same direction , there was a moment
’s lag .   
Nailbiter ’s fingers stabbed at me , and I was forced to throw up the Wretch , forcing Sveta ’s hand away .
Fingers and motorcycle glanced off of the wretch within a half - second of one another .
“ Asshole , ” I said .
“
She was mine .   
I was dealing with her , ” Damsel said .
“ Shut up , ” Beast of Burden said .   
“
Now .
”
I flew back and further away .   
Byron and Sveta were retreating , cutting through taller grass along the side of a fence .   
Nailbiter , though , had a bit of the height advantage .   
Even though she did n’t fly , her body was long .   
She pointed at them .
That was Disjoint and Sidepiece
’s indication to go on the offensive .   
Beast of Burden trudged back to the road .   
Sidepiece dug out a fragment of bone and hurled it like a dart .
“ Dodge !
”
I called out .
Sveta did .   
She pulled herself away , grabbing Byron , and then tugged him away .   
It did n’t get him free and clear , and he was at the very periphery .   
It looked as though his armor protected him .
He blurred and became Tristan .   
More confident in a skirmish , maybe .
Beast ’s clique began advancing through the field , closing the distance .   
Damsel joined them .
They had only barely finished managing dealing with these Fallen , with our help , and now they were turning on us .   
They fully intended to tear through any and all opposition , to be the last ones standing .
I wanted to help , but throwing myself into the midst of that group was difficult .   
Too many powers , too easy to get hit from multiple angles .
I flew for one of the pieces of debris .   
A bike engine .   
Beast of Burden turned on his heel to keep me in view , and said something to the others , keeping them focused on Tristan and Sveta .
I threw the debris , and Beast of Burden slapped it aside before it could hit anything .
I ’d meant it more as deterrent than anything .
Disjoint grabbed Sveta , and I could see her stumble .   
Sidepiece prepared to hurl something .
It was Chris to the rescue .   
I was pretty sure it was him .
Black , feathered , and wholly unintuitive in construction .   
He had four legs like a crow ’s talons , but large and spindly , and his body wrapped in on itself , with thick scale - like plates like the talons that extended around his ‘ face’ and front .   
The actual features were n’t birdlike , but were nestled in the ‘ conch’ of his physical form .   
If he ’d been a banana , the eyes , mouth , and useful features would have been on the inside curve , the outside curve facing forward .   
But he was more of a tight spiral than a banana , confused by the crests and flares of large , glossy black feathers that filled the gaps .
It was only because his eyes were spaced out that he could rotate them and look out to the sides , each eye yellow with a distorted pupil .
The feathers were heavy and hard , I realized , as he blocked one blast from Sidepiece by rearing up and fanning the feathers out .
He stumbled in response to the explosion , then dipped back and into the field of wooden racks and greenery .   
Beans , it might have been .
Dark Introspection , he ’d called this , if I remembered right .
The addition of an unknown player gave them pause .   
It was our opportunity to back off .   
Beast of Burden
’s group gathered together .
“ I would have had her , ” Damsel said .
“
Will you shut up ?
”
“
You ’re strong but slow , ” she said .   
“
You lack grace , and you need mobility to deal with mobility .
”
“ Enough .
”
I could see the others getting together .
I could also see that the Fallen were gathering .
Snag had said he outnumbered these guys ?   
It did n’t look that way .   
I could see Love Lost and a few others .   
Cleat .   
Etna .   
There were a few mooks , rounding out their number to ten or so , but not many with powers that I also recognized .
They were backing away from a larger group of Fallen , twenty - strong .   
More young Fallen with cheap masks , less in the way of tattoos .
Their leader was n’t like that .   
He had an aura to him .   
As dark and grungy as the others were , as cheap as many of their costumes were , their skin cluttered with tattoos , he was all in white .   
White hair , white mask of overlapping segments with no eyes and black lipstick across the feminine mouth , white tunic , white leggings , white cane .
Valefor .   
He ’d attacked my hometown .
He ’d be leadership , or he ’d be up there .   
He had that pedigree .
The plan had been to evacuate people , knowing they ’d go back .   
I ’d come to terms with that .   
But the hope , the focus , was that we ’d deal with the leaders .   
If we could deal with the Fallen capes and the lieutenants who were willing to go to war , maybe we could break the back of the larger group , leaving them aimless .   
Maybe some of those aimless people would find their way back to society .
Twenty of them , and if there were unpowered in there , they were gussied up like the ones with powers , confusing things sufficiently that we could n’t discount them at all .








“ Valefor , ” I said , just loud enough for the others , Damsel included , to hear .   
“ Hypnotist Master .   
I wrote about him in the document .   
Do n’t look him in the eyes .
”
Chris was in his bird - spiral Dark Introspection form , and he curled up further , eyes nestling in deep , so his eye only barely peered out .
We backed up as the Fallen advanced as a crowd .   
Chris prowled around behind us on long , black , bird limbs , his eye peering over our heads .   
the pupil resembled a human face in shape , but more a cross - section of the middle of the face .
I wished I ’d asked for more details on just how his forms functioned .   
He might not have answered me , but on the off chance that he did , I ’d have some sense of what we could do to defend ourselves .   
I just knew it was maybe a solution of sorts in the face of Mama Mathers , the anti - thinker measure , her family , or some combination thereof .
Crises tended to highlight things .   
They brought out the best and worst of us , whether it was courage in the face of danger to our loved ones or craven behavior in the midst of desperation .   
They showed us who our friends were and how much they cared .   
I was getting a sense of things I really needed and wanted to work on with these guys , and where our strengths as a team were .   
Case in point : I needed to figure things out with Chris .
I ’d never really had to think about it .   
I ’d grown up with my first team , and I ’d known them intimately by default .   
They had been there by default , up until a crisis bad enough it had broken us .
“
You wanna piece of me ! ?
”
Sidepiece screamed out the words .   
She put too much pitch in the higher sounds , and managed to get some vocal fry in the mix .
“ You ’ve got to stop saying that , ” Disjoint said .
Love Lost was n’t screaming , and the others in her group were n’t attacking .   
Cleat , Etna , they only retreated in our general direction .
“ You want some of this ! ?
” Sidepiece screeched .
“ Silence ! ”
Valefor called out .   
He pointed his cane in her direction , as he shouted it , and a few people tensed from that action alone .
Sidepiece shut her mouth .
“ If the intrusive twits give each other advice , I think we should listen , ” Damsel said .   
“
Do n’t look at him .
”
Sidepiece shook her head .
“
She was n’t looking , ” Beast said .
“
Let ’s go , ” I said .   
I turned to go , hand on Sveta ’s shoulder .
“
Do n’t run !
”
Valefor called out , at the top of his lungs .
My stride halted , and I swayed a bit before finding my footing .   
Introspection Chris had been quicker to stop , and I bumped into him in the midst of my retreat .
“ Do n’t go anywhere !
” he cried out .   
His arms were out above his head , as if he shouted it to the heavens .
I turned around to look .
The others were reacting in a similar way .   
Beast of Burden was one of the last to stop moving , and nearby bowled over the teammates that were using him as a human shield .   
Sveta lost her balance , tipped over and crashed to the ground , arms paralyzed around her , not moving fast enough to break her fall .
Shit .
I took off , flying straight for Valefor .   
I was n’t the only person with the same idea .   
Nailbiter attacked , fingers stabbing out .
One of Valefor ’s
people said something , distant enough he was barely audible , his hand on Valefor
’s shoulder .   
Other capes were protecting the group against Nailbiter .   
One was producing a plume of red smoke that moved in slow motion .   
The claws hit the smoke and stopped like they ’d hit inviolable steel .
The cane swung out my way .   
“ Stop .
”
I canceled my flight , dropping down to the ground .   
I took a few steps forward before I could stop .   
Our side was twenty or thirty feet behind me , and Valefor was another sixty or seventy feet ahead of me .
Nailbiter kept up the offense , bringing her claws back like she ’d been hurt by the curling smoke , and then swiped in from the side , trying to catch the group from the other side .   
The defending Fallen threw more smoke in the way of the attack , so red it looked like plastic , opaque and moving through the air at a crawl , once it left the Fallen man
’s hand .
“ Attacker , ” someone said , hand at Valefor
’s shoulder , indicating Nailbiter .
Sidepiece joined in .   
She did n’t advance or retreat , but darted out to the side , fingers clenched in her guts , ripping something out .
“ Cease , ” Valefor called out .
Both Nailbiter and Sidepiece were affected .
Nailbiter stopped , then withdrew her fingers .   
Breathing hard , Sidepiece held a chunk of what might have been appendix or ovary in her hand , blood dripping freely down her arm and off of her elbow .   
More blood flowed from the fresh injury in the roadkill mess that was her gut , over her pelvis and the rise of her low - rise jeans , and splattered onto her sneaker .
She dropped the bit at her feet .   
It detonated , and she was flung to one side .
“ Clever , but no .   
You lie there , guts girl , ” Valefor said .   
“
Do n’t move a muscle .   
The rest of you ?
”
Damsel used her power , hurling herself forward .
“
No powers , ” Valefor called out .
Damsel stopped .
“
No weapons , no tools .   
None of you .   
Stay still and wait .
” I had n’t been looking at him .   
I glanced at him , and I could see that his eyes were still covered .
The instructions he was getting .   
He could n’t see .   
His power worked without him needing to see ?   
Or had he tapped into another source , replying on a cape that granted vision like Mapwright
could get and grant mental images of areas ?
My heart pounded , and I felt nausea welling up .   
The Fallen chuckled .   
A few of the young hooligan types cackled and danced around , arms waving as they approached , spreading out .
We ’d been too tied up with Beast of Burden .   
What should have been a brief engagement , taking out the two powerful Fallen and then retreating had become a thing .   
Valefor had gotten into earshot , and apparently that was all he needed .
I was having trouble thinking straight .   
Paralysis seemed to freeze my thoughts as much as it did my body .   
I ’d dealt with it for two years , being unable to move under my own weight .   
The need to move became something fluttery in my chest , which fanned the swell of nausea .
It felt like colors were different , as was the clarity of my vision , as if I had someone else
’s eyes .   
I was acutely aware of the feeling of my clothing on my skin , every breath and how they were n’t measured to the breaths before or after them .
No powers , he ’d said .   
I could n’t bring myself to fly .   
I could n’t bring the wretch out .   
I glanced at Love Lost ’s group .   
They ’d been bound by words in the same way .
I looked down and tried to focus .
The Fallen closed the distance .   
I ’d charged in , and that put me front and center .   
I got a good look at Valefor as he approached .   
There were white feathers in his hair and around his collar .   
He bent his head at an angle while talking in a whisper with the person leading him .
His companion stopped him a few feet in front of me , thumbs hooked in the slim belt at his waist .
“
Mama told you to help us , ” Valefor said .   
“
You did n’t .
”
“ We did , ” I said , still looking down .   
“
We got your people to safety and protected them .
”
“ I ’ve been told there are Fallen casualties , ” Valefor said .
“ Pazuza and Gel are dead .   
Smashed to a pulp .   
Jay and Nell , ” his companion said .   
A guy with a face tattoo visible in the gaps of a ragged head - covering that only let his eyes peer through .   
“
Some injured .
”
“ Family , ” Valefor said , sticking his cane in my direction .   
“
Do n’t lie to me .
”
The fact that he was talking to me meant that I was off limits for the rest .   
The hooligans with demon masks and the darker , more adult Fallen walked past me , toward Beast of Burden and the others .   
We were quickly getting surrounded , except surrounded was the wrong word .   
We were stones in a river , and the Fallen were the water .
“
We did n’t kill your people .   
We did protect and evacuate some , ” I said .   
“
That ’s the truth .
”
“ Evacuated ?   
Yeah , that ’s not a good thing , ” he said .   
He walked around me , reaching out until he touched my arm .   
I flinched a little at the contact .   
His fingers traced over the decoration at my shoulder .
I felt angry at that .   
I was reminded of being in the hospital , of being manhandled by nurses and carers that only wanted to get on with their days .   
When you were a certain kind of helpless , people took it as their right or common sense that they got to touch you .
“
You ’re going to help us .   
Tell me you understand .
”
“ I understand , ” I said , the words escaping my lips , barely audible .
“
You ’re going to help us .   
You ’re going to serve us .   
Tell me you ’re going to serve us .
”
“
I ’m going to serve you , ” I said .
Amy .   
The thought sprung to mind .   
Amy .   
Amy .   
For two years it had been Amy this , Amy that .   
All my thoughts in service to being with her , thinking about her , wanting her .
Another compulsion .   
Then and now , when I ’d hit my limit , frustrated- He reached up to my cheek , and gave it two sharp pats , audible .   
“
Good .
”
Anger became indignation , enough to choke me , together with the irregular breathing and the nausea .   
My head shook a little , my vision grew dark around the edges , and I teetered slightly .
I tipped over the brink , past the point where the use of my power was willful and wanted and at the point where it was something I had to hold back .
In surrender rather than intent , I lashed out with fear and self - admiration , and I let the Wretch loose , with Valefor in arm ’s reach , in that order .
Had it been the other way around , the Wretch might have gotten its hands on the man .   
But intimidation took hold , and Valefor was assisted by his manservant , who hauled him back and away .   
He sprawled in the grass .
The manservant was slower to get back , his attention on helping Valefor .   
Compulsion , possibly .   
An invisible hand struck him in the arm , and the arm folded backward , wrist slapping against elbow , skin tearing from the blunt impact and the bones cutting him from within .
What was the rule I ’d set for myself ?   
Seventy - five percent ?   
Seventy - five percent of the harm done was fair .
I was n’t sure how to quantify physical harm against the emotional and mental harm done .   
Standing where I was ,
Wretch active ,
Fallen backing away from me , I was in a fugue , emotions a storm as things I ’d been bottling up sought release .
Valefor ’s distraction had apparently freed people , or served as a kind of punctuation to end his ongoing commands .   
I was free , even as the ‘ serve’ command lingered in the corner of my mind
’s eye .
It was like the Amy compulsion , the desire I could n’t fulfill , painful to think about and unwanted even in its straightforward way .
Amy , Amy , Amy .   
A wild , repetitive thought .
I could keep it in the corner and avoid thinking .   
A trap I would n’t fall into if I did n’t take a step or clear partisan action .   
I would n’t help Valefor , but I would n’t or could n’t hurt him either .   
I could n’t speak .
I flew up and back to get myself safe .   
Neutral .
Others were taking advantage .   
Capricorn slugged a hooligan that was up in his face , gauntlet to chin .   
Nailbiter , Beast of Burden and the others tore into the crowd that had moments ago thought they could pass through our group without incident .
Love Lost screamed , aiming the scream more at the Fallen stragglers .   
The red smoke Fallen had already thrown some defenses up around Valefor , so the two of them seemed unaffected .
Others were caught in the effect , and their demeanor shifted .   
Some looked happy in a demented way , others went cold , and it was hard to tell with others , as their costumes and masks covered them up too much .   
They charged at Love Lost , and she met them with hands out , claws outstretched .   
Cleat was a few paces behind her .
Some were n’t getting up .   
Sveta .   
I could see her looking up at me .   
Sidepiece lay where she was .   
Others were n’t fighting .   
Chris in particular had backed away .   
Good .
I still felt nauseous .   
My skin still crawled .   
I was still pissed , but it was bottled - up pissed again .
I looked in Prancer ’s direction , and saw that he was moving on , heading away from us , not toward .   
Some of his people looked back .
We were facing the casualties of Beast of Burden
’s decision to split apart .   
Prancer had to know we were here , with the noises and shouting , he was n’t that far away , but they ’d decided to go .
“
Stop ! ”
Valefor called out .   
“ Freeze !   
No powers !   
No weapons !   
No tools !
”
Again , Beast of Burden was the last one to stop .   
I turned to look , and saw Damsel off to one side .   
Her arm was limp at her side , and she gripped her forearm with her hand .   
Blood ran down to her fingertips .
Valefor had affected his allies , too .   
There had been a note of emotion in his voice , frustration and a bit of fear .
He could n’t see .   
His voice was his control over the situation and he ’d momentarily lost it .
There had been a time he ’d needed eye contact .   
Now he used his voice .   
The trouble with a voice was that it was n’t focused .   
I could remember the cane , and the way both Nailbiter and Sidepiece had obeyed at the same time , earlier .
It worked on someone if they thought they were being referred to .
There were mental tricks I imagined someone could do .   
It seemed like a noose that could be slipped , especially when he referred to people in the general .   
I just was n’t sure I could do it .
“
Pagan , stand at ease , ” Valefor said .   
He tilted his head slightly and said the words like they were a joke .   
“ Report .
”
The one the Wretch had hit shifted his weight until he could roll over enough that his knees were under him .   
He knelt on the ground , clearly unsteady as he worked his way to his feet as best as he could without his hands .   
His good arm cradled the damaged one .   
“ Two dead .   
Ten injured , my best guess .   
I ’m one of them .   
I need help soon .
”
Two dead .
Were those dead on my hands ?   
I ’d created a momentary opening , others had taken advantage of it .
What would have happened if we had n’t been here ?   
Would there be less lives lost ?   
Or would some of the dangerous individuals be Valefor ’s captive audience ?
Could I afford to even think about that ?   
We were-
we were caught again .   
So long as we could talk and we could hear him , there was n’t a good way to avoid his effect .
“ Fallen , you can move , ” Valefor said .   
“ Look for anyone that ’s covering their ears .
”
Fallen that had been paralyzed started moving Fear was making it hard to breathe .   
Could I use that again ?   
Another disruption ?
“
Girl with the spikes that I was just talking to .   
Calm down .   
Do n’t try to be clever .
”
Just like that , my thoughts were dulled , and I found myself going back to the little meditative phrases and mental loops .   
Old PRT case numbers , a mantra I ’d started to go over once when I ’d needed to break a loop of thinking , which had inadvertently become something that calmed me down .
We ’d been prepared for Valefor as he was , with outdated records and a printout of a wiki page that had been salvaged from someone ’s laptop after the slow process began of rebuilding the internet .
Case zero was Scion .   
He was also , I presumed , the last case .   
Case one was the Siberian , technically the one who had first started the case files , as the PRT consolidated old data and tried to get information from other government agencies .   
Case two was Behemoth , his rise had incited the creation of the PRT .   
The case series had been an excuse to gather data from international agencies , too .   
Case three was the lie of the virus , an early claim about the origin of powers , propagated by an early online newsgroup .   
Case four was The Player , an early Thinker mastermind who had required some greater cooperation across multiple agencies to root out .   
Later on , The Player would be a case - in - point for the formation of Watchdog and its core purpose .   
Kenzie ’s would - be group .
The first cases had inspired things , major functions and interests .   
Committees had been formed and those committees had become something .   
Even though a whole chunk of the early ones were minor or fabrications in the end , the virus theory included , they ’d led to things like a dedicated parahuman science department .
Ordered , interesting , familiar .   
It was calming , even if I did n’t want to be calm .
We ’d talked about how to deal with him .   
Tricks , techniques .   
I ’d thought I could use my aura , to try to override or distract .   
I ’d been right .
I ’d gotten two Fallen killed and the ensuing fracas had led to roughly half of them being injured .   
I was n’t sure how I felt about that .   
The idea of death weighed heavy , even if it looked as if it was Beast of Burden and Nailbiter
’s doing .   
Violence and death did n’t weigh heavy for them .
“ Our side matches yours in number .   
From what I ’ve been told , you ’re divided , fighting among yourselves .   
We are n’t .   
The strength of faith , ” Valefor said .   
He said it almost ironically .   
“
Let ’s tip the scales .   
You ’re going to serve us .   
You ’re going to fight for us .   
I ’ll talk to you one by one
and I ’ll have you pledge allegiance , starting
with-
”
I heard Damsel ’s power , brief .
Beast of Burden said something , his voice a growl .
“
I said not to be clever , ” Valefor said .   
He drew in a deep breath , then tilted his head as far to the left as it would go , where ear would have been touching shoulder if his mask did n’t cover it .   
“
Do you want to see what I can do if I get creative ?   
Someone assist me .
”
A Fallen woman near him hurried to his side , supporting and guiding him .   
She had her tits out , and every inch of her was caked in goopy black paint , which obscured her features and hid details .   
Where her lips parted , the paint had cracked , so there was only a broken hard ridge , with lips , teeth and tongue behind .   
It even caked her hair .
It did n’t look like a Tempera sort of thing .   
Just costume .
They navigated the crowd , Fallen moving out of their way , our guys and the violent capes frozen in place .
Valefor was far enough away from me that I could barely hear him .   
He stood in front of Damsel .
Her power flared .   
She stumbled .
The woman with Valefor said something .
“ Stop , ” Valefor said .   
“
Do n’t do that again .   
Move your hand .
”
She pulled her hand away from her forearm .   
There was a hole where she had dug her thumb in under the skin .
We ’d talked about this , but not- not quite like this .
“
You-
” Valefor started .
The power flared again .   
She stumbled , spell broken , and then brought her good hand around , toward Valefor .
The woman in black paint let go of Valefor and caught Damsel ’s wrist , forcing it upward .   
The power shot well over their heads , and Damsel fell .
“ Cease , ” Valefor said .   
“
Let ’s distract you .   
Kill your friends .
”
Damsel wheeled around , turning toward Nailbiter and Sidepiece .   
Then she hesitated , looking up at me .
The woman in black paint moved , lunging to intercept another attacker .
Chris , leaping in .   
The woman in black kept him from getting his talons on Valefor .   
He was a spiral twist of feather and scaly talonflesh , with eyes and hard ridges in the mix .   
His spindly talons raked and grabbed , but the woman in black was fast , strong , and possibly a precog .
He ’d picked this form with Masters in mind .   
Capes that controlled people .   
He had n’t been willing to say just how or why it helped , only that he was unsure how well it would work .
At the time , I ’d told myself he ’d be kept back and out of the way , so it barely mattered , especially if we could n’t be certain how reliable it was .
Chris got two of his four talons on Damsel , and he tossed her .   
She used her power while mid - air , and landed roughly on her feet , one hand touching the ground .   
Her injured arm hung limp .
The arm sparked and she fell .
Fallen pushed past our people to help Valefor , as Introspection Chris tried to reach around the woman in black and scratch him .   
Powers came to bear : red smoke , a snake that looked like it was made of intestine and barbed wire , sprouting spikes that crackled with electricity- Introspection Chris disengaged and leaped back as the Fallen came rushing at him .
Him was really a quirky word to use when he had this form .
There were two with enhanced speed , and the barbed intestine snake had reach .   
He was n’t that fast in this form , even if he was faster than a normal human might have been .   
The speedy Fallen tackled him .   
The snake caught his leg .
I flew a little closer , unconsciously , wanting to keep an eye on things , make sure he was okay .   
Mrs. Yamada had charged me with their care .
The two Fallen with enhanced speed looked related .   
They sped up , but as they did , their bodies deformed .   
Legs bent the wrong way , operating digitigrade , the tops of their heads twisted , until their lower jaws pointed the opposite directions that their upper jaws , noses , and eyes did .
From the way he reacted to their hits , they hit hard too .   
Strength , speed , but at a cost to fluidity of motion , steadily increasing clumsiness and facility .
He shook them , and the first fell , the second slipping and the getting a hold of one taloned foot .   
Fallen advanced on Chris as a larger group .
The two awkward Fallen speedsters were bleeding , I saw .
Just as the group seemed poised to go after him , I pushed out with my aura , hard .
Heads turned .
I had n’t even meant to .   
It was instinct , and it was instinct on behalf of Chris .   
I did n’t even care that much about Chris .
The act on his behalf brought the pledge to Valefor to mind .   
I ’d promised to serve , and it was a loop in my thoughts now .   
The usual techniques did n’t help to break it .
It was a peculiar battlefield , so many people frozen in place , the combatants on the Fallen side not wanting to break the spell by jarring anyone too much .   
I had n’t experienced it myself , but it seemed that if people were told to stop , and were set to moving by a stumble or a push , that was enough that it needed to be renewed .
Damsel had broken her prosthetic hand to make her power spark , each stumble forcing a renewal .   
Now she stalked toward the group .   
Her last order had been to kill her friends .
Thought process :   
I needed to help Valefor .   
I needed to help the others .   
I could n’t break the mental loop
and I could n’t remain neutral anymore , now that the thought was heavy in my mind
’s eye .   
I would help Valefor .
I flew to Valefor , while everyone ’s attention was on Chris .   
Fallen turned , the woman in black first among them , skin red and sunburned beneath the cracked black paint .   
There were veins of red through the paint that were n’t sunburned skin peeking through , either , and I saw she had horns , now that I was closer .
I brought the Wretch forth as she lunged for me .
The Wretch was invisible , and she had planned her punch and tackle to hit me , not a force a few feet in front of me .   
She bounced away , and the Wretch disappeared .   
Others were so distracted with Chris and now Beast of Burden , who had been jostled in the fighting , they did n’t even seem to notice .
I collided with Valefor fairly hard as I put my arms around him .   
He could n’t see me coming , so he could n’t even brace against the impact .   
I would help him in such a way that he could n’t tell me to stop helping and put himself in danger again .
Collecting him , I flew away from the scene .
I would help and serve him .   
That was the idea he ’d planted in my head .
Before he could catch his breath from the impact , I flew in a spiral tight enough his legs went out to the side , and then gently deposited him on a rooftop .
I flew away before he could catch his footing , get a lungful of air , and give me another command .
The compulsion was n’t gone .   
It was there .
But it had abated .   
I ’d served the rule , but not the spirit .
The tide had turned .   
The villains that were assisting us were B - listers , but the Fallen were n’t the cream of the Fallen ’s crop either .   
I flew past the group , jostling people , grabbing them and letting go a moment later .
Valefor would n’t find his way back in time , I hoped , and the Fallen were already injured from the brief surprise attack .
A spray of cold water from Capricorn woke up everyone I had n’t been able to reach .   
The Fallen retreated , the intestine - snake snatching up two and yanking them back .   
I did much the same in finding Sveta lying in tall grass , her suit and wig without a head beneath .   
A knife impaled her back but had n’t penetrated the shell .   
I carried her away , feeling the reassuring thump of her presence within .
“
You okay ?
”
I asked , once we were in the air .
“
Embarrassed , ” Sveta said , her voice sounding a bit like it came from the depths of a well .
“
Okay , ” I said .   
I landed a distance away , just far enough away
we could keep Beast and Damsel ’s group of capes in sight .
Once four - legged , now three - legged , Chris limped his way to us .   
He breathed hard and curled up tight .   
Byron followed .
“
Hey guy , ” I said .   
I wished we had a name for him .   
“ Mr. Introspection .   
You ’re missing a leg .   
You okay ? ”
He blinked once .
I had no idea what that meant .   
Go figure , that he was n’t any more forthcoming when he did n’t seem to have a working mouth .
“
What did you end up doing ?
” Byron asked .
“
Took Valefor away .   
He ’s still out there , ” I said .   
“
Unfortunately .
”
I eyed Damsel , who was at the periphery of Beast of Burden
’s group .   
There was a dark look in her eye as she talked to that group , clearly heated and I was n’t there to talk her down .
“
Tristan could n’t switch to me , I do n’t think , ” Byron said .   
“ When we were talking about capes we might run into last night , we theorized it was a thing we could do , that if he switched to me I might not be compelled , but he did n’t switch .
”
“
It ’s okay , ” I said .   
“
We knew there were a half - dozen things we could maybe do , and some worked , some did n’t .
”
“
I hate-
I hate losing control .   
I only have control over half my life to begin with , ” Byron said .
“
Yeah , ” Sveta said .   
Her face peered up through the neckhole of her suit .   
“ There’s- Careful , Victoria .   
Or , Byron , can you put your gauntlets over this gap , fasten it when I say so ?
”
“
Sure , ” Byron said .
“ Be careful , ” Sveta said .
She ’d undone a clasp at the shoulder .   
She brought her head out ,    twisting it around in a way a neck could n’t .   
Her tendrils were bound with metal rings into a loose column that disappeared into her suit .   
She began working her way into a comfortable position .   
“
Not having control , it sucks .   
Fuck that guy .
”
“
Agreed on both counts , but the lack of control helped us , ” I said .   
“
It ’s how I used my aura .   
It ’s what Damsel did .
”
Sveta pursed her lips .
Damsel was stalking .   
Sidepiece and Nailbiter were sticking with her .   
Disjoint hung back , talking to Beast of Burden .   
Etna , Love Lost , and Cleat seemed to be a sub - clique in that group .
Byron blurred .   
His armor shifted tints from blue to red .
“
It ’s what Dark Introspection here did , ” Tristan said .     
“ Mind - body disconnect , right ?   
Looking inward , elective connection .
”
Chris curled up tighter .
“
Yeah , ” Tristan said .   
He bent down to give Chris a pat .   
“
You ’re so weird .
”
“ You did good , ” I said .
I could see the looks on faces throughout our small group , or what I could see of faces .   
Chris being wound together , Sveta looking so deeply unhappy , Tristan ’s eyes being narrower .
It was n’t just us .   
The violent capes were more agitated .
I felt that way .   
The panic that had let me tap into the aura and Wretch was n’t going all the way away .   
I wore armor and a costume that made me feel like standing tall and I felt very small .
Fuck that guy was right .
“
What did he tell you ?
”
Tristan asked me .   
“ Orders , compulsions ?
”
“ To serve , to help .   
I helped by removing him from a dangerous situation .   
I ’m not
all the way resolved , there .   
I do n’t want to run into him again .
”
“
Did he tell you to lie ?
”
“
Stop that , ” Sveta said .   
“
She would have to say no if he did , so it does n’t matter .
”
“ Not always , ” Tristan said .   
“
Sometimes you get loopholes .   
It ’s worth asking .
” I shook my head .   
“
He did n’t tell me to lie .   
He was distracted , I think .   
He tried to pull a big gambit to turn the tides and he ’s operating blind .   
Literally , I do n’t think he can see .
”
I still had the traitorous , general thoughts and impressions from the compulsion .   
I was familiar with having thoughts that were n’t mine in my head .   
The mind was supposed to be sacrosanct , the thoughts it contained purely sourced from oneself and for oneself .   
Valefor had violated the former , like Amy had violated the latter .
On a level , I was just happy I had n’t killed him .   
I knew there was an argument for why I should have , had I had the opportunity .   
I also knew it would have been a betrayal of myself and the me I wanted to be .
For all these reasons and more , mind control was another one of the parts of the game .   
Too many people found it viscerally horrifying , myself included , and the way things could break down if mind control saw common use was too big of a problem .   
The natural reaction from society , or from our sub - society , was to fight back .
Valefor obviously did n’t care .
He did n’t give me the impression of someone at home in a big thing like the one we ’d been in , especially after the fighting had started , and he ’d still been pretty damn scary .
“ We could go , ” I said .   
“
We caught them off guard once or twice there , and we got some lumps in .   
It ’s not quite breaking the back of the Fallen , but we could pull away , regroup with others , and plan for the perimeter and Looksee
’s trap .
”
“ I want to do more , ” Sveta said .   
“
I was useless back there .
”
“ I ca n’t back down from this , ” Tristan - Capricorn said .   
“
I think if we run into him again , if I ’m alert , I might know what to do .
”
“ If you ’re sure , ” I said .
He nodded .
I looked down at Introspection Chris .   
“ How about you ?   
You good to retreat to the background ?   
Gallop in if you see the need and feel up to it ?
”
He lurched to his feet , curled and uncurled like he was stretching , and then loped away , swaying a bit to compensate for the missing forelimb .   
He bucked a bit , claw reaching up , and then the iffy camouflage kicked in .
“
Okay , ” I said .   
“
I have a lot of questions .
”
“
His whole thing is he does n’t like answering them , ” Capricorn said .
“
He ’s doing his part , ” Sveta said .   
“
That was brave .
”
“
It was insane , ” Capricorn said .   
“
No offense intended to present company , brothers , or self .
”
“
Fine line between bravery and insanity , ” I said .
I looked across the clearing to Beast of Burden
’s group .   
Damsel was n’t pacing anymore .
Capricorn approached and stood next to me , his armored shoulder touching the spikes at mine .   
Sveta stood at my other side , looking in that direction .
“
Do we try this ?
” Capricorn asked .
“ We might have to .   
I do n’t like leaving her alone like this .
”
“
Okay .
”
Capricorn put a hand up .   
Disjoint was watching us , and nudged Beast of Burden .
Their group went quiet .
I was well aware that Love Lost was a danger to Rain .   
I was aware of how dangerous these guys were in general .   
Beast of Burden had killed two members of the Fallen ’s inner circle , it sounded like .   
They ’d been people
Valefor was close to .
We approached , slow and steady .
“
Can we try this a second time ?
” Tristan asked .   
“ Truce ?   
We deal with this whole situation .   
There are hostages we need to rescue and we ca n’t afford to fight .
”
“ I like the idea , ” Disjoint said .
“ Backup would be awful nice , ” Sidepiece said .   
She had a really annoying voice .   
I ’d noticed it earlier .   
A bit of the teenage vocal fry , trying a bit to sound cute , but she was n’t a teenager
and I did n’t think she was cute .
“
Not your call , ” Beast of Burden said .
“
Is it supposed to be yours ?
” Damsel asked .
“ You can be quiet , ” Beast of Burden said .   
“
I ’ve heard too much from you today .   
Earn your stripes first , then talk .
”
“
Hey , Damsel of Distress , ” I said .
She turned to me .
“
You good ?   
Any lingering compulsions ?
”
“
No .   
I do n’t have much goodness to go around , but I do n’t have any compulsion either .   
I do n’t have friends .
”
“ You gave me a look , ” Sidepiece said .   
She had hair over one side of her face , but she did n’t take very good care of it , and a mask in the same cut as the phantom of the opera one , albeit cruder , covered part of her face .   
Black makeup filled her lower eye socket and distorted the impression of her eyeshape .   
“
A very flattering murderous look .
”
“ I thought about it , ” Damsel said , imperious and proud , chin rising a bit .   
“
I do n’t know if you qualify as a friend , when I barely know you , but I do n’t mind your company , Sidepiece , and I can respect a lady with the discipline to have a … twelve inch waist ?
”
She smiled a bit .   
Her arm sparked , her power ripping between the wound at her forearm and her fingertips .   
and she stumbled into Disjoint .   
Frowning , she backed away until she was a short distance from everyone else .
“
Sixteen inches , last I checked , but thank you .   
You ’re a dear , ” Sidepiece said , ignoring the power misfire and maintaining her intentionally frayed voice as she feigned higher class .
“
Will you help us ?
” I asked .
“
No , ” Beast of Burden said .
Nailbiter and Damsel exchanged a look .   
Nailbiter looked over at Sidepiece .
“
Yes , ”
Nailbiter said , voice whistling slightly .
Beast of Burden wheeled on her , finger pointing .   
“ Not your choice .
”
“
Democratically ?
” Sidepiece asked .   
“
I think most of us want the help , Bob .
”
“
This is n’t a democracy , ” Beast of Burden said .   
“
This is a fucking tyranny .   
You signed on for it , and you agreed
I ’m
leader because I ’m good for the business and track record .   
You also agreed that if the crown is moving to another head , it ’s going to do so outside of jobs .   
Leaders ca n’t be second guessed on the field .
”
“
Either we run or we press on , ” Damsel said , second guessing him .
“
Enough , ” Beast of Burden said .
“ If we press on , we ’re going to face worse than we just did .   
I agree with Sidepiece and Nailbiter .   
It makes sense , ” Damsel said .
Her power sparked again .   
She maintained her balance , overcompensated , and stumbled a step the other way .
“
You okay ?
” Sveta asked .
“
Just fine , ” Damsel said , curt and sounding anything but .   
She turned back to Beast of Burden .   
“
Do n’t be a wuss , Beast .   
You look weaker trying to go this alone than you do taking the help .
”
Before Beast of Burden could reply , Love Lost approached him from behind .   
She rapped claws with blood still on them on the back of his armor .
He turned .
She pointed at Nailbiter , then at us .
“
She ’s the client , ” Damsel said .
He stabbed a finger her way .   
“
Last warning .
”
Her power sparked .   
This time she fell .
“
Good .   
Stay like that , ” Beast of Burden said .   
He stepped forward and placed one iron boot on the edge of her dress .   
Damsel remained where she was .   
Struggling would have been futile .
“
Do n’t be a dick , ” I said .
“ Do n’t interject yourself into our business .   
If the client wants help , fine .   
We ’ll do this .
”
“ We need to find the hostages .   
We ’ll reunite with another group we ’re working with and use their thinkers or other resources .   
If there ’s a confrontation , we work together , ” I said .
Beast of Burden shrugged , spreading his gauntlet - clad hands slightly .   
He stepped off of Damsel ’s dress , and went to walk in the direction the fighting had gone .   
It seemed with Prancer mobile and Velvet having some emphasis on enhanced maneuverability when driving with her telekinesis , they were moving around a lot , and the Fallen were giving chase .   
They had moved away since the fight with Valefor .
Love Lost pointed .   
She did n’t spare Damsel a glance as she walked on .   
Some of the others joined her .   
Nailbiter , Disjoint , and Etna .   
Sidepiece lingered as Damsel picked herself up .   
Her arm sparked twice , but she did n’t fall .
She gave us a look , then stalked away .
We cut through the north end of the settlement , toward the northwest corner , and the sound of ongoing confrontation got us jogging after them .   
Well , I flew , but the rest jogged or ran .
Prancer was engaged .   
They were fighting with hit and run tactics , and when the Fallen did n’t take the bait or stopped to pause , Prancer ’s group assaulted buildings .   
There was a shop on fire , and a large garage with a truck in it that now had a chunk missing .
A big part of what let them do that was the heroes at the west end of the settlement , and the presence of the Undersiders .   
Bitch and her dogs were standing beside Vista .   
Narwhal was close , and two black stuffed animals reared up at the edge of the camp .   
Foil was there , but Tattletale was not .
No Valefor , but I could see a core group of Fallen with fancier costumes and that kind of presence .
Nobody that looked like they could be Mama Mathers , either .
The pressure was on , and the Fallen looked to be losing ground .   
There were world - class capes lined up against them .   
If the actual groups were even in power , and I was n’t sure they were , then Prancer ’s group was playing it in such a way that even if the Fallen won , they would n’t have a town left after .
My phone buzzed .
I pulled it out .
Looksee : 

Not peeking am reporting what others saying .   
Precog with me says Vista says that the hostages you want are toward south end of town .   
Map attached .
The text had an image attached .
I flew skyward , looking .
A group .   
Valefor ’s group , with Fallen civilians and others .   
The hostages .
We could figure something out .
White flickers danced in the corner of my vision .   
I looked away , but they persisted .   
Like the motes of dust in my eye , but akin to snowflakes .
If that was their anti - thinker measure , which might well be Mama Mathers , then even the thinker - esque advantage of having a bird ’s eye view was enough to give them an in .
I grit my teeth .
I ’d seen the building Looksee had marked on the map .
Dropping out of the sky , I landed beside the group .   
“
This way .   
The-
”
Turning toward Beast of Burden
’s group , I was just in time to see him backhand Damsel across the face .   
It was a casual swing , but he was strong and he wore a gauntlet .   
She hit the ground hard .
“ Jesus fuck , no wonder your team is mutinying , ” Capricorn said .   
“
You ca n’t play nice with others in a crisis ?   
There ’s stuff going on !   
Be a professional .
”
“
She did n’t even say anything !   
This time !
”
Sidepiece said , bending down beside Damsel .   
Damsel pushed her away .
Her damaged hand at her face , the other used to get to her feet , Damsel worked her way to a standing position .   
I did n’t see anything resembling Ashley in her eyes .
“ I gave her a final warning , ” Beast of Burden said .
“
Hey , ” Capricorn said .
“ Damsel , ” I said .   
“ Ashley .
”
“
Stop , ” Beast of Burden said , pointing at Damsel , talking over me .
One hand still on her face , she pointed at him and blasted before his expression could change .
Darkness , shadow , distorted space and visual static ripped through armor , flesh , and armor again , tearing a hole clean through him .   
The hole caved in on itself , metal creaking as it bent , blood fountaining out and splashing up on half the people nearby .








“ Damsel ! ”
Sveta cried out , as the initial shock wore off .
Everyone was backing away from Beast of Burden and from Damsel , who caught her footing and looked down at the body .   
Sentences were an overlapping jumble .
“
What did you do ?
”
Disjoint asked , eyes wide .   
His mask was a black stick - on sort , but it was divided into two halves , one for the brow and one for the cheekbones .   
As his eyebrows went up and his eyes went wide , the two halves separated , revealing red - painted skin beneath .
“
What I did is obvious , ” Damsel said .
“
Fuck , ” Sidepiece said .   
She ran her fingers back through the sides of her hair , and there was enough residual fat and blood on them from her using her power that her hair stuck where it was pushed .   
“
He had n’t paid me yet .
”
“
Why ?
” I asked .   
“
Why did you do this ?
”
“
He stepped on me .   
He struck me .   
In a fight ?   
That ’s fine , you can hit me in a fight .   
But like this ?   
When I ’m helping ?   
I ’ll hit back .
”
“
That ’s not a hit , ” Sveta said .
Damsel paced a little .   
People were giving Damsel and the blood spatter a wide berth , and as she moved , people backed up more .
Nailbiter was on the far side of the group , furthest from me .   
She prowled on elongated limbs , silent , staring .
Damsel spoke up , “ I will not be stepped on .   
I will not be beaten down and take it with a smile .   
He wanted to be a tyrant but he could n’t lead .   
He did n’t know his own place in things
and he thought to tell me mine ?
”
“
So he dies ?
” I asked .
“
He knew what he was doing , ” she said .   
“ He-
”
Her power misfired .   
She staggered a bit , and Capricorn and Sveta backed away more .   
Damsel found her balance , but when she did , her hair draped down in front of most of her face , and she let it hang there .
She continued , “ He knew the risks when he went toe to toe with me .   
When he struck me , it was n’t heated .   
It was cold , logical .   
He knew if he did n’t do something , he ’d lose his team .   
He calculated the risk and he calculated it wrong .
”
“ You pushed him to that point , ” I said .
Sveta touched my arm .   
Fear that I was provoking Damsel when she was in a dangerous state ?   
Or because I sounded accusatory ?   
Both ?
“
I calculated wrong , I thought he was smarter .
”
She said .   
She stuck out a foot , and rested her foot on Beast of Burden ’s forehead .   
His helmet had tipped back by its own weight , exposing a face with narrow eyes , and a muttonchop beard .   
His head was resting on the part of the helmet that had once been behind his neck .   
She moved his head around by moving her foot .
“
Stop that , please , ” Sveta said .
Damsel paused .
Sveta pointed at the foot .   
“ Please .   
Even if he was n’t a great person , he was human .   
He deserves common decency .
”
Damsel stepped back , placing her footsteps where there was n’t too much blood .   
There was a dusty print on Beast of Burden
’s forehead now , with some small rocks settled into the corner of his eye , by the bridge of his nose .
“
Thank you , ” Sveta said .
In the background , lights danced around the shadows of the trees at the west edge of the settlement .   
Vista and Weld ’s group .   
It caught Sveta ’s attention , and I saw her focus her balance , swaying slightly less .   
I could imagine it as a tension in the tendrils within her body .
On the other side of things , while everyone else turned to look at the shifting reds and blues and greens , my focus was on Ashley .   
I saw something in her expression , as she looked at Sveta , then at Capricorn , and finally met my eyes .   
It was fleeting , spooked , more like how an ordinary person might look if they were at the mercy of ex - Slaughterhouse Nine member Damsel of Distress , than Damsel of Distress herself .
Hardly the imperious bearing she had a moment ago .
I saw the expression pass before any of the members of the other group could react .   
Love Lost tilted her head a little , walking around the periphery of the larger group- a wide periphery , given how we ’d spread out and backed off .
“
This is the true world of parahumans , ” Damsel said , turning to look at Love Lost .   
Damsel ’s chin rose a little , as she went back to being the villain queen .   
“
The other things fall away , but this remains a constant .   
It ’s why we all die young .
”
“ Endbringers and end of the world helped , ” Sidepiece said .
“ The end of the world never stopped , ” Damsel said .   
“
This is it , continuing , wearing demon masks and cheering about fucking over the rest of us .   
It ’s wearing stupid helmets with horns as long as my legs and thinking it can find its way to power by killing its enemies and stepping on anyone in its way .
”
“
It ’s blasting a hole in someone with a stupid helmet , ” Disjoint said .
She turned on him .   
He stepped back some more .
“
Do n’t blast a hole in the guy with the stupid limb teleporting power , ” he said .
She started to talk , then stopped as her power misfired again .   
She gripped her arm , pressing down on the hole where she ’d dug her thumb in .   
I assumed it was the point where her arm stopped and the prosthetic started , interrupting the connection .
I was lost .   
She ’d always been tricky to deal with , but I ’d mostly had a good sense of what made her tick .   
I ’d been able to talk her down a few times , I knew what she liked and what she wanted .
I did n’t know , here .
“
Fuck me , ” Capricorn said .   
“
I do n’t know what to say .   
This needs to be answered , but there are people with lives on the line right now .
”
“
Go , ” she said .   
“ You guys seem to be good enough at finding us and showing up at inconvenient times .
”
Capricorn shook his head .   
“
Fuck this , ” he said .   
Angrier
, he said , “ This is n’t over .
”
“
No , ” Damsel said , her chin rising a bit more .   
“
I did n’t think it was .
”
“
This is n’t good , ” Sveta said .   
“
This is pretty far from okay .
”
“ I ’ve always been a long way off from good and okay , ” Damsel said .
“
That ’s not an excuse to turn your back on those things .
”
“
Oh fuck off , you sanctimonious cyborg , ” Sidepiece said .
“
Clearly not a cyborg , ” Damsel said .
“
I’m-
yeah .   
Not a cyborg .   
And I ’m fucking off , do n’t worry .   
People to help .   
Damsel of Distress ?
”
“
Fuck offff ,
” Sidepiece said , head lolling back .   
She stopped as Damsel raised a hand .
“
What ?
”   
Damsel asked .
“ Help yourself so others can help you , ” Sveta said .
Sveta and Capricorn were ready to go .   
I hesitated .
Everything kept coming back to the same scenarios , moments , and scenes .   
There were parallels , comparisons , things about people I noticed .
A therapist I ’d talked to while Mrs. Yamada was away had explained it to me as a consequence of trauma .   
Some things were just so big in our own heads that they had their own gravity .   
They demanded to be dwelt on and they leveraged that dwelling to tie everything back into themselves , every detail they invoked and every question they raised .   
They were impossible to figure out but we had to try , and that trying became more leverage .
She was fundamentally broken as a person .   
I did n’t know a lot
but I knew that , standing here and seeing her standing over a dead body .   
I ’d been there , I ’d been a witness , and I ’d been galled then too .   
I ’d witnessed a breakdown of someone extremely dangerous .
I one hundred and fifty percent understood Capricorn and Sveta ’s reactions .
Those who had their trauma get too big were the types to extend it to everything .   
A bad event became a fear of the world , or of men , of capes , or it became self - loathing that permeated every part of one ’s own being .
The remedy was to talk to someone , to get perspective .   
Complicated by the fact that sometimes people were n’t equipped to understand or to listen .
I stared at Ashley and the villains who stood around her .   
They had n’t rejected her outright .   
Love Lost , Cleat , Disjoint , Sidepiece , Nailbiter .
They were n’t equipped .   
Just the opposite .
“
I ’d like you to turn yourself in , and submit yourself into our custody , ” I said .
Her eyes widened slightly .
“
There it is , ”
Nailbiter said , in that eerie voice with its whistles and hisses of breath through teeth .
“
There what is ?
” Sidepiece asked .
“
Our hooded girl here called Damsel by her real name .
”
“
There ’s a history , ” I said , at nearly the same time as Damsel said , “ History .
”
“
Uh huh , ” Nailbiter said , disbelieving .   
“
The timing ’s off .   
When these guys showed up .   
When you did .
”
Damsel spoke without taking her eyes off me , “ She probably came after me .   
I fought her family in Boston .   
My second trip , a while later , I fought her boss in the Protectorate .
”
“
Not my boss , ” I said .
“
No ?
”
“
I was n’t a Ward for long , and he was n’t in charge at the time .
”
Damsel shrugged , very easily and casually , as if she was n’t standing over the body of the man she ’d murdered .
“ I ’ve fought your family , and we ’ve had run - ins , ” she said .   
“ Bonesaw , who brought me back from the dead , fucked up her sister and attacked her family in their home .
”
“
Do n’t go there , ” I said .
She raised her hands in a ‘ I give up’ kind of way .   
Her power arced around the one , an aimless stream shooting off skyward at an angle before fizzling out .
“
Come into custody , we ’ll take you with us , we ’ll have you stand down and stay off to the side until this whole thing wraps up , ” I said .   
“ I know you ’ve benefited a lot from the amnesty .   
There are people you talk to and people who help you maintain a normal life .   
If you walk away from this scene , that ends .
”
“
Holy shit , heroes are annoying , ” Sidepiece said .   
“
Let ’s go .   
I ’ve got a bingo sheet to fill out , and I ’ve got ta land a direct hit with a bit of uterus or set off a combo explosion with a spleen toss if I want to clear a row .
”
She approached Ashley , reaching out .   
Nailbiter barred her way .
Was it worth it ?   
The ruse did n’t matter anymore , we were n’t going to keep her in this role .   
Like so many things , she ’d been great when the going was good .   
When things got rougher- we needed to figure something out later .
It only mattered in that if we did n’t end up taking her away from this and revealed her role , she ’d end up in danger .
“ If you come , Damsel , I ca n’t promise there wo n’t be consequences , but I ’ll testify about circumstances .   
It ’s a chaotic situation with Valefor as a factor , and everything else .   
They ’re mitigating factors .   
Protect the amnesty , here .
”
I saw her start to lift her foot from the ground .   
Her power flared , and she bent over at the waist , catching one knee with her good hand .   
It would n’t have been enough to catch her balance entirely , but Nailbiter had draped fingers along the one side .
Damsel put a hand on Nailbiter ’s finger to steady herself as she straightened .
“ You have people to help , ” she said .   
She pushed at Nailbiter ’s finger .   
“
And I ’m done with this .   
I ’m going to get my arm fixed before I start killing everyone I see out of pure frustration .
”
“
Good plan , ”
Disjoint said .
Will you confess ?   
I wanted to ask .   
Will you tell someone ?
I could n’t ask it out loud , because there was no answer she could give that would suffice for all parties involved .
Leaving was n’t as good as her staying in our sight , but it was better than staying with this bunch .
Sveta and Capricorn were making their careful way toward Valefor , moving slowly for my sake , and to keep an eye on my exchange with Damsel .   
I flew to them , and they started moving faster as I joined the group again .
There was still the situation further into the settlement proper .
“
She ’s walking away , ” I said .   
“ Best we can get .
”
“ I did n’t know it would be that hair - trigger , ” Capricorn said .
“ I figured it was , ” another voice said .
We stopped .   
Tristan summoned some orange motes around his hand .   
Sveta brought up one hand , holding her forearm .
The terrain moved .   
It was the camouflage blur that was Chris , except the effect I ’d seen was patchy and inconsistent , and Chris was almost seamlessly fitting into the environment .   
The form was mostly faded , but I could see the spikes and ridges that were feathers .
“ I must be the only person who was n’t surprised by that , ” Chris added .
“
How the hell did you get that good with the camouflage ?
” Tristan asked .
”
“
Staying still helps .   
Being a genius helps too , ” he said .   
He made a dry cackling noise .   
“
Not that I ’m a genius , exactly .   
I ’m good at getting into the mindset and physical form
that makes me good at doing something .
”
“ And
being a weird spiral bird helps with camouflage how ?
” Capricorn asked .   
He edged closer to the corner of a building , trying to get a peek of the situation .
”
“
The introspection - self - reflection - reflection - grief wing of things ?   
Great for self awareness , which is great for knowing just how I ’m positioned
and how I look .   
Do n’t spend too long looking , Capricorn .   
They ’ve got a fucky-
”
I saw the camouflage distort as he brought his hands to his head .
“ -power , ” he said .
I thought about the visual ‘ snow’ and it flared back into existence at the lower right corner of my eye .
“
The anti - thinker measure , ” I said .
“
Yeah .   
Guess
so .   
One of the Fallen with the hostages .   
Valefor ’s there .   
My Dark Introspection form disconnects mind from body , which is great if I want to put my body on autopilot or leave it with instinctive actions , but it does n’t stop my mind from being fucked with .
”
“
You should n’t be this close to things , ” I said .
“
Well , I am .   
I did stuff while you guys were running around .   
I get fucked up when I do the deep self - dive with that form , so I told my body what to do and interjected a few times with new input .   
I think I ’m having a good day , my body definitely was , but it ’s hard to tell with the emotional aftertaste .
”
“
A good day ?
” Sveta asked .
“
Yeah , ” Chris said , with a note of something that might have been incredulity , or even curious emphasis .   
“
This is why I ’m in the game .   
Running with the big guys , dealing with the big things .   
Lives on the line .
”
“
You ’re a kid , ” Capricorn said .
“
Right now ?   
I ’m halfway toward being a freaky personification of Dark Introspection and being a pink skinned scoundrel .   
We ’re all special cases , Cap .   
Ashley snapping should drive that home , if your daily schedule had n’t already .
”
Sveta looked back in Ashley ’s direction .
“
You ’re talking a lot , ” I said .
“
I ’m desperately trying to ride an excited high here , because the alternative is slipping into Introspection or dealing with the fact some power is trying to drive me nuts .   
Work with me .
”
“
I ’ll try , ” I said .
I wanted to sound more confident and authoritative , but-
I did n’t like how we ’d left Ashley , or how we ’d let that happen .   
That was something that weighed on me , and the melancholy I ’d noted earlier in the day was giving way to something that riffed on the panic I ’d experienced with Valefor .
Except the hints of panic I felt was n’t about one situation with Valefor , or even about this greater conflict .   
It was about big picture stuff , and one impulse call by Ashley had brought the big - picture concern into focus .   
I knew she ’d called it calculated , not impulse , but I could n’t see how it could be .
I wanted things to be better and right now , they were n’t .
But I needed to focus .   
I needed to work with these guys , like Chris had said .
I glanced at Sveta , and she looked just about as lost as I felt .
I reached for her hand and gave it a waggle .
“ Hostages , ” I said .   
“ We want to deal with Valefor too .
”
“ I prepared another form in case we needed to fight , ” Chris said .   
“
It ’s slow .
”
“ Vigilance , ” Capricorn said .
“
Yeah .
”
“ Save it .
”
“ Fourteen hostages , by the way .   
There are five Fallen , one Valefor , two people from the Clans , and someone who might be the guy in charge of the bikers .   
I spent a while looking , and I ’m seeing ghosts now , I think .
”
“
Not good that that ’s a thing , ” Capricorn said , “ But this is good to know . ”
He extended a hand down toward Chris , who was still camouflaged , albeit less tidily than before .   
He straightened , moving his arm like he was pulling Chris to his feet .
“ Fuck , ” Chris hissed .   
Things clattered to the dirt around him .   
Some were camouflaged .   
Others were containers .   
“
I thought you were shaking my hand or something .
”
“
What is that ?
” I asked .
“ Food .   
Because I need to fuel up , and my next form is dense .   
Some meds .   
Plus my walkman and pocket atari , and some other stuff .   
I was sorting out my stuff after getting dressed again .
”
“ Walkman ?
” Capricorn asked .
“
We ’re post - end of the world , I ’m not going to bring my phone and risk it getting broken or losing it and having someone use it to figure out my secret identity .   
Fuck , it ’s hard to see it now that it ’s not on me .
”
“
You ca n’t bring all this stuff , ” Capricorn said .
“
Fuck off , ” Chris replied .   
“
I do things how I do them .
”
Capricorn sighed faintly and bent down to help .   
I took Capricorn ’s spot at the corner of the building , peering carefully around .
Chris protested , barely audible but clearly pissed .   
“
No , do n’t help .   
You ’re just moving it around , and it ’s hard enough to keep track of things when holes are appearing in everything .
”
“ Holes ?
” Capricorn asked .
“ Holes .   
Flesh with holes in it like it ’s rotting , but round , fleshy , and damp , ground with pockmarks
, walls with more holes , and-
” his voice became slightly higher pitched as the intensity of them ratcheted up , “ Things are looking at me or wriggling on the other side of the holes .   
It ’s not the coolest !   
I ’m trying not to think about it !
”
“ Shh , ” I said .
They stopped talking , but Chris continued to rummage and rustle , and Capricorn stood back , arms folded .
Conversation continued in the distance , as the people managing the hostages talked .   
I could peer around the corner and past a tree to see a slice of things between two buildings , but it was n’t much .   
I did n’t want to move too much and alert anyone .
“ Problem ?
” Sveta asked .
“ I wanted to see if I could overhear anything .   
Chris is seeing things , why are n’t they affected ?   
Is it selective ?
”
“ I could n’t tell you , ” she said .
“ I ’m going around , ” Sveta said .   
She swayed a little and touched the wall with one hand to steady herself .
“
Okay .   
Be careful .   
Do n’t let them affect you like they did Chris .
”
She extended her arms out , reaching out with tendrils that had the arms at the ends to hamper them and weigh them down , then pulled herself away with less noise than Chris made as he packed up his stuff .
The Fallen settlement was wedged in between a ‘ v’ of forest , with the road cutting in from the east .   
The settlement proper was a denser cluster of rustic buildings , and houses dispersed out into the wider area , thinning out the further they were from this settlement .
I had the impression that this was the city center .   
The main road cut through the cluster of buildings , about two houses down from where I was , and it seemed to do so with a weird angled turn in it .   
It made me think these buildings had been some of the first , and the road had been an afterthought .
The hostages , from what I ’d seen from my bird ’s eye view , were being made to sit in the road , corralled by a group of people with powers .   
Valefor among them .
I ventured further along , checking the coast was clear , then skip - flying over to the next vantage point by pushing off the ground with my foot and flying from there once airborne .   
The buildings remained dense between myself and the Fallen .
Sveta dropped down from above me , scuffing the wall as she did .   
It seemed intentional , to keep me from startling too much or lashing out in anticipation of an attack .
She pressed her fingers to my mouth .   
Leaning in close , she murmured in my ear , “ Two to your left .   
Two to our right .   
They were told where we are .   
About twenty feet away .
” I nodded .
She pulled away and turned to one side .   
I turned to the other , so my back was almost touching hers .
My instinct was to go up .   
I flew , and at roughly the same moment , Sveta went low , torso almost flat against the ground , and she pulled herself in the direction of Capricorn and Chris .
I brought myself up to the roof level , and navigated the rooftops while using them as cover from anyone on the street .
Gunfire in the distance was met with more gunfire .   
Prancer , Velvet , Moose , Narwhal , Weld , and Vista , with some of the Undersiders .
My heart pounded .   
I moved with only light contact using toes and fingertips to guide myself as I stayed as close as I could to the rooftop while not putting any weight on it .
I saw them .   
A man and a woman .   
He was wearing a costume with ragged black leather enveloping most of him , and a round metal mask surrounded by leather that obscured the shape of his head .   
The skin of his arms was tanned with arm - hairs sun - bleached .   
His visible skin was dripping with sweat .   
It was n’t that hot a day out , with the sun hidden behind the clouds but that much leather had to be intense .
The woman was Fallen .   
Her mask inverted her face , so she peered through the mouth - hole , and horns swept out from the top and bottom corners , for four in total .   
She ’d dressed lightly enough she had to have been cold , with a strapless top bound to her body by thin chains .   
More chains wrapped around the red cloth wraps that encircled her forearms , pelvis , and legs .
As I looked down from above , I could see that she was touching the wall as she walked by it , leaving a trail of what looked like gaseous glass .   
It formed edged , hooked shapes as she left it behind .
I flew a course intended to take me behind them , so I could do something quick and decisive .
Yellow lights flared along the length of the glass , gaseous smoke .   
Eyes .
The smoke billowed out , taking on a more solid form as it became a nebulous mass of teeth , barbs , claws , and razor edges .
I raised my forcefield and smashed it .
My forcefield won , but only barely .   
The beast - smoke I hit broke into solid chunks , some as large as my head .
The woman-
I turned to look and saw her creating more smoke as something that billowed toward me in a wave .   
I backed away until my forcefield was up , then crashed into it , hard .   
I saw her stumble back , arms around her face .
Behind her , the guy with the circular mask had four lenses spaced evenly around the mask flare with energy .   
Four shapes manifested in front of him- long and slim , round , thicker crescent , and a star - like shape with radial spokes .
I pushed out with my aura before he could do anything .   
The woman stumbled and landed on her ass .   
The guy weathered it , paused , and then touched the long , slim one .
The other three images disappeared , but the one he ’d touched flew at me like a javelin .   
I threw myself to one side , but it was n’t even aimed at me .
It flared with a dark amber light as it embedded into the wall , then faded .   
I put some distance between myself and it .
The woman created more smoke , sending it down the side - street in a wave that grazed buildings on both sides .   
I flew up and away .
I pushed out with my aura , and it failed .   
Like a car failing to start , it sputtered and died out .   
On my second try , it did work , but it felt weak .
Power dampener .
My flight felt fine .   
The wretch , unfortunate as it was , felt okay too .
Was it because my awe power was the one I ’d been using ?
The woman with the glass smoke sent a column skyward .   
As I flew back and away , I could see it expanding out into the air .   
More demon imagery ran through it , all the overlapping chaos of hell , snapping jaws , and ripping claws .
The guy was creating another diagram .   
Three images remained , now .
Yeah .   
This group that was with the hostages was important , if they had people like this as bodyguards and errand - runners .
I flew away from them , trying to get a sense of how vulnerable
Valefor ’s group was .   
I was aware he ’d gotten some hooks in me earlier , but I was n’t feeling it as much .   
I was n’t sure if the emotional shock of Ashley had shaken me of some of it , or if it was subtle in a scary way .
I saw another glowing object pass through two walls and part of a short fence before hitting the ground twenty feet below me and twenty more feet to my right .
It detonated with the impact , expanding out into the space around it , getting thinner as it did .
The moment I realized it was expanding at a rate that would catch up with me , I flew toward the ground , away from the bubble .
My flight sputtered out , maneuvering dying , speed cutting out , and the entire thing threatening to just give up on me altogether .
I landed hard , with a grunt .
Explosion bomb , javelin dart , and two more , and my flight and aura were both in tatters .
I could at least reassure myself that these things did n’t tend to be permanent unless they were power theft .   
Powers wanted to be used , and submitting to a power - canceling effect on a permanent basis did n’t make sense .
A mixed feeling , when I thought about the Wretch being permanently removed .
Now it was more or less all I had .   
I could hear the smoke creatures .   
I could see the spire that had been sent skyward , that now was a rigid pillar .   
After they attacked , they seemed to solidify into solid fixtures .
“
Work with me , ” I whispered .
I brought out the Wretch , and I hit the nearest building , shattering the wood exterior .
I remained where I was , feeling that fluttery panic feeling again , tinged with the heavy feeling that always came with the Wretch .   
I used the moment to retrieve my metal mask and don it .
I reached out in the direction of the shattered wood , and I grabbed one lengthy piece .   
“ Arm yourself , ”
I said , my voice muffled by the mask .
The wretch reached out for other chunks of the wall .   
It bit into them , drummed them with impacts that made the whole building complain , and shredded solid struts with fingernails , punches , and kicks .
I canceled the field , then brought it out again .   
I seized another long bit of wood , a supporting beam , and hauled on it .   
The Wretch hit it , and broke it at the base .   
I stumbled as it came free .
One - handed , using only my regular strength , I tossed the three feet of two - by - four up .
The Wretch caught it .
They were getting closer .   
I could hear them .
My heart sank as the Wretch gripped the two - by - four so hard it splintered and broke at the middle .
“
Use it as a weapon , ” I said .
There was no indication the Wretch heard .
The pair were making their approach .   
The guy had one glowing circle on his mask , now , and a crescent moon of manifested power - canceling energy that he held like a sword .
The smoke woman unleashed her power on me .   
I charged in , crashing into it , and shattered the first ten feet .
The Wretch threw the two feet of two - by - four , or it let go of the piece as it dissipated .
The block of wood hit the masked woman in the face hard enough to knock her off of her feet and break the horn at the right side of her her chin .   
The smoke ceased flowing , and the forms went still .
I ’d hoped it would use the weapon to break stuff before it broke down in turn .
I watched as she tried to get to her feet , stumbled , and then fell back down again .   
On her second attempt , she created two columns of her power , letting them solidify , before using them as leverage to stand .   
She slumped against one , then slowly slumped back down toward the ground .
That left me to deal with the guy who could disrupt powers with his arsenal of minor abilities .   
Right .
He went to the girl first , still holding his blade , and bent down by her .
“
She okay ?
” I asked .
He did n’t respond .   
Slowly , he helped her get to her feet .
In the same instant , the two of them looked off to one side , as if they ’d heard a loud noise .
He dismissed the sword , one of his eyes lighting up , then drew out the star thing .
He cast it down at the ground , hard .   
He and the girl disappeared .
The direction they ’d been looking .   
The Fallen that had been watching the hostages .
I ran after them , trying flight when I could .   
It took a few running steps before I had something that was better than legging it .
Capricorn and Sveta had arrived .   
That was the only thing I could see as a more or less unambiguous plus .
There was a group on the scene , facing down Valefor and the other Fallen , with the power nullifier and glass - smoke woman having already rejoined them by teleport .   
A woman with a bunny mask and marching band outfit , ears poking up through the brim of the flat - top , feathered cap .   
There were three people in costumes that I did n’t recognize , and there was Rain , with the metal mask , gloves , and dark hood .   
He was tense , and he was tense for damn good reason .
Their arrival had precipitated something I ’d seen as more or less inevitable .   
With as many players in this game as there were , the hostages were always going to be the last card the Fallen group could play , so a part of me had trusted and hoped that they would hold off on playing it .
Something Rain or this mystery group had done had spooked them enough that they ’d played the card .








Against a backdrop of screaming and writhing , with clouds rolling across the overcast sky , and both dust clouds and smoke rolling over the ground , the three assembled groups were very still and careful .
“
Stop it , ” Rain called out .   
“ Leave them alone .
”
“ Ca n’t , ” Valefor said .   
“
She is n’t here .   
But if she sees you stand down , this might end .
”
There were kids in that group of writhing individuals .   
There was an old man with the lines in his neck standing out taut , teeth bared and clenched together .
“
I ca n’t stand down , ” Rain said .   
“ Reversing the protection takes time and effort to undo .
”
“
Then this is your righteous punishment , ” Valefor said .   
As he started talking , I brought my hands up near my ears .
My powers were still wonky .   
I could tell .   
My flight and aura did n’t feel readily available .
Beside me , Capricorn had morphed .   
From Tristan to Byron .
The Fallen guy I ’d just been fighting said something low and under his breath , to Valefor .
“
No .   
The immunity is n’t him , ” Valefor said .   
“
Not if the rest of them are the same .   
Someone helped .
” Capricorn had changed again .   
Back to Tristan .   
He walked a little , moving away from me .   
What were they doing ?
The woman with the bunny mask walked , almost strutted around the periphery of things , her rapier in hand .   
The capes with Valefor kept their attention on her , while Valefor was oblivous or uncaring .
“ We ’ve got other capes showing up , Valefor , ” a Fallen soldier said .   
Young , and possibly powered .   
I was n’t sure if I could read too much into costumes or outfits
when unpowered and powered were so diverse , but if I was going to , I ’d assume powers for the ones who had more identity to their costumes , with confidence rather than conformity in the designs .   
This guy had bright colors and a hard mask that wrapped around the top and sides of his head .   
It was made such that it looked like it had been nailed on , with blood , old and fresh , seeping out from the points
the nails went in .
“
The ones we fought earlier , ” the one with the round mask said .   
The round plate of a mask with four eyeholes cut into the hard was an identity of its own .   
It stood out .   
I knew there were powers there , already .   
He supported the woman with the four - horned mask and red wrappings .
Those two aside , there were six other Fallen that kept Valefor company .   
Nine in total .
“ Team , ” Rain called out , raising his voice to be heard over the screams .   
“
There ’s one Fallen that is n’t here .   
Mama Mathers .   
She ’s close .   
You ca n’t look at her without her infecting your mind .   
Her voice and touch does the same thing , but gives her other avenues of attack .   
Mentioning her gives her a big opening
, it ’s why I could n’t say anything earlier .
”
Well , that cleared up something that had been plaguing the good guys for a long time .
“ I saw a glimpse of her , ” I said .
“
You see things ?
” he called out .
“
Yeah .   
Some .   
She got our Changer worse .   
He seems to be dealing alright , though .
”
“
He ’s enduring because he ’s weird , ” Capricorn said .   
“
What can we do here ?   
These people- ” “ You do n’t do anything , ” Valefor interrupted .   
“
They ’re ours .
”
“
Yours ! ?
”
Tristan - as - Capricorn asked , voice raised , blurring .   
Byron - as - Capricorn shook his head , and offered a more sedate , “
No .
”
He was almost drowned out by the shouts and screams from the people on the ground .
“
Where is Mama Mathers ?
” Rain asked .
“
You should ask her , Rain , ” Valefor said .   
“
Let her in , let me in , and pledge to obey .   
We ’ll let you drag these people away , so long as you stay .   
They ’re expendable , you ’re blessed .
”
“
How are you immune ?
”
Tristan - as Capricorn called out .
“ Friends , ” Rain said .   
He created blades of silver light in each of his hands .   
“
Found these guys while researching powers and options .   
March put the pieces together about who I am and where I ’m from .
”
He ’d indicated the woman with the bunny mask .   
March continued pacing around the group .   
Her rapier ’s tip dragged along the ground .   
It left a trail behind it , like the water rippling in the wake of a stick being moved in it , and that water had hues of blue , purple , and black running through it for a second or two after the contact .
“ I thought it was another kind of brainwashing after I heard about Valefor ’s exploits in Brockton Bay , with the arrest and trial , ” March said .   
“
It ’s a good thing that my group has a lot of powers to work with .
”
A lot of powers .   
Cluster capes ?
“
A good thing , yeah , ” Rain said .
“ I ’m not poaching him , ” March said .   
“
He ’ll help me out in exchange for this , here , but he can stick with you guys .
”
“ With the heroes here , not the Fallen , ” Rain clarified .
“
Oh yes , ” March said .   
She nodded and the one ear at the top of her mask bobbed where it was folded at the tip .   
“ I should ’ve been clear .
”
My eyes moved away from March to the people on the ground , then to the nearby buildings .   
I could n’t lose sight of the major goal here .   
Was Mama Mathers there ?   
I could look at the civilians on the ground without a problem , which meant she was n’t there , or her power was more subtle than that .   
I ’d caught a glimpse earlier , though , so she could n’t be too far .   
There were a dozen buildings in our immediate vicinity .   
Was she watching through the window ?
The trouble was , if I saw her , I risked being affected like the people on the ground were .   
If I did n’t see her , she had the advantage
and she could catch us by surprise at a time of her choosing .
The idea of losing my mind like that terrified me , to the point I felt like my gut and my brain were bound in knots .   
I tried to focus that terror into a cold , rational look at what I needed to do .   
Mama Mathers was the biggest danger .   
Valefor was the second .   
They were Masters and Strangers , the PRT classification for those who controlled others or minions , and the classification for those who infiltrated or deceived .   
Mama Mathers and Valefor were squarely in the overlap between the two .
I found myself missing my old team .   
New Wave had had its problems , but I ’d known the team and how it worked .   
I was n’t a strategist , but I could do fine if I could identify the big problems and solve them .   
My tendency back in the day had been to hit hard as my method of solving , and to rely on my instincts and the team .
These guys were hard to rely on .   
New Wave had been all about straight lines of attack and barrier defenses .   
Lasers and punching , shields and forcefields between danger and the vulnerable .   
The most indirect we ’d been was when my dad made his grenades bounce off walls or when my cousin had created forcefields in unconventional but otherwise simple shapes .
Here ?   
Sveta had disappeared while all attention was on others .   
Capricorn was … it looked like he was changing forms rapidfire to switch identities , so no one self heard a single whole utterance referring directly to them .
Chris was off doing something , hopefully far away from this .   
Rain
was-
he ’d contacted people I barely recognized .   
I ’d seen March ’s mask before , but it had been in passing .   
An article about one of the big cities .   
There ’d been a weird dynamic there , but I could n’t afford to dwell on it .   
My mind went to a bizarre combination of upper - class and low - class crimes , like corporate espionage and petty vandalism , but I knew almost right away that I was thinking of the wrong person .
It had been something offbeat like that , though .   
If the people had n’t been screaming , and if I was n’t focused on Valefor ’s body language and Mama being somewhere nearby , I wanted to think I could ’ve placed it .
I still had my hands by my ears , as a crummy and unreliable solution to a serious problem .
My powers had been disrupted , put out of reach and made unreliable , but the effect was dissipating with time .   
It killed me that the time was time innocents were suffering .
There were goddamn kids in there .
If I flew and hit someone , would I be risking the innocents on the ground ?   
They were close enough together that people on foot would n’t be able to get to Valefor without trampling the civilians .
“
There ’s a pretty one lying next to me , ” Valefor said .   
“
Short black hair , or so I hear , she tends to wear-
”
“ I see her , ” four - eyes said .
“
That ’s all you needed ?   
Hm .   
Step on her throat .   
Not enough to kill .   
Enough to give our Rain a time limit .
”
The guy with the four - eyed mask transitioned the four - horned girl to another , more mundane Fallen .
Rain hurled his crescent blade .   
Four - eyes drew his own , creating the diagrams- two faint and one clear , and he drew the clear one as part of the same motion .   
His crescent - shaped sword was just in time to meet Rain ’s power .   
Both fizzled out .
I saw as the other silver blade Rain held fritzed , distorted , and faded away .   
He looked down at his hands .
“
He threw something at me , ” Four - eyes said .
“ If it hit you , do n’t move .
”
“ It did n’t hit me .   
I stopped it .
”
“
Then step on the girl , Amaymon .
”
I flexed my aura , straining , praying it would n’t falter .   
I saw people turn in my direction , including both Four - eyes and Valefor .
I saw Valefor pause for half a second , catching his breath , drawing it in deeper , and I clamped my hands over my ears , bending over , eyes shut .
Whatever he shouted , I did n’t hear anything muffled than a one - syllable word .   
He had to refer to us to catch us , and now that I knew that , I could watch for tells .   
If he drew in a deep breath to shout , or if he said something like ‘ You’ or “ Everyone’ , I could cover my ears .
All around us , most people stopped in their tracks .   
Capricorn , blurring , changed to blue armor , but he kept walking .   
I was able to move , and the group with March and Rain seemed unaffected .
Valefor shouted out something , turning in my general direction as he did it .   
Two words .   
I did n’t try to make them out .
The Fallen were bringing their powers to bear , now .   
A snake shaped out of intestine and barbed wire- one I ’d seen before .   
The Fallen that summoned it was drawing a gun with the other hand .   
Amaymon was creating his four diagrams , reaching for the sphere .
He did n’t manage to touch it .   
Sveta grabbed him and Valefor both , dragging them out of sight .   
The afterimage of the diagram hung in the air for a moment before disappearing .
Another was going breaker , arms and bony limbs reaching skyward in a fountain of parts that grabbed their other parts and forced them down in the swell , a large human skull that ate their head , then was swallowed up by a larger animal skull , like a wolf ’s , only horned .
They grew larger as they rose skyward , all white bone and jet black body parts .
I tried to fly
so I could fly to it before it grew any larger , and my flight only sputtered out .
The one with the intestine snake lashed out , snake lunging from the palm of their hand to Capricorn and I.    They aimed and fired the gun at the same time .   
Wild shooting .
I brought out the Wretch , stepping between Capricorn and the shooter , and even with the Wretch being a larger target , none of the bullets hit it .
I heard the shooting stop , the sound of the small pistol ringing in my ears .   
I dropped my defenses for just a moment , so I could have the Wretch closer to me when I connected my fist to the Snake
’s ‘ head’ .   
It slammed into a building , shattering the stones and mortar that lined the lower half of the ground floor .   
A half - second later , white noise filled my vision .
If that had happened a second earlier , I might have missed .   
The noise persisted .
I scowled , stopping in my tracks , trying to find out what I needed to do .   
I could n’t run in and use the Wretch , not when people lined the ground like that .   
Not when I could n’t trust my eyes .   
She was n’t making me hallucinate , but she could obscure what I saw .
“ Down ! ”
Capricorn said , behind me .   
“ Give me a clear view !
”
There were blue motes appearing around the snake - intestine cape and the giant breaker thing , which was slowing in its growth , but was a pretty considerable size already .   
I realized the noise had gone away .   
Ahead of me , the Fallen woman disconnected the snake - thing from her left hand , and passed the gun to it .   
The motes above and behind her turned to water , spraying down on her and at the giant breaker .
The motes snapped into a solid form , making a creaking , cracking noise as they became a growth of stone that encased part of the snake - woman ’s head and shoulder and part of three of breaker ’s arms .
The weight of the stone pushed her down and snared the breaker .   
A moment before she was crushed beneath the stone , it became water again .   
She was down on three limbs in an awkward position as it all cascaded and sprayed down around her , stirring the packed dirt road into thick mud spray .
I leaped forward toward the spray , flight kicking in at half - strength to give me downward velocity .   
I came down with one foot on her gun - hand , crushing it beneath my heel .   
I stepped down by her face , and moved my foot off of her hand .   
I pushed at her shoulder with my foot , flipping her over , then bent down for the gun .
“
Good , ” Capricorn said , behind me .   
He was Tristan , but the water was remaining water .
“
Careful you do n’t drown the people on the ground , ” I said .   
“
They ’re helpless .   
People can drown in shallow water .
”
He nodded , quick , before turning his attention back to the big thing , which was adjusting its balance .   
The unexpected weight on one arm had brought it partially down .
I had to do something .   
I did n’t want to keep my head down .
I ran to the side .   
Down toward the direction where Sveta was , away from the big thing .   
Against my instincts , but I had an idea of what I could do .
Mama Mathers had been here .   
She was close .   
If I could n’t see her without problems , I could only make assumptions .   
Aura out , I ran along the side of the street , keeping one eye on the battle and the people on the ground , in case I was needed .   
Women .   
Young men .   
Someone elderly .   
Kids .    
Shit .
Ahead of me , Sveta was dealing with Amaymon and Valefor .   
She ’d pulled off her wig and stuffed it into Valefor
’s mouth , and was now wrestling with Amaymon .   
The cape broke her grip and pushed her to one side , and she collapsed into a heap , instead of catching her balance .
He created his diagram while she was down .   
He touched the javelin - dart , and he sent it plunging into Sveta ’s chest before she could stand .
I charged at him , running three steps and then flying the remaining twenty feet .   
My knee connected with his jaw and he dropped .   
I landed and made sure he was n’t getting up .
“ Sveta , ” I said .
“
I ’m
okay ,
” she said .   
She sat up .   
A tendril stuck out of the hole in her chest , feeling around it before withdrawing .   
“
I ’m
okay .
”
“ You have a patch ?
” I asked .
She nodded .   
“
You have your aura going .   
It ’s distracting enough
I ca n’t coordinate .
”
I nodded , and I temporarily eased up on it .   
“
Your power is okay ?
”
“
Yes .   
Why ?
”
She had n’t seen , she ’d already backed off before Rain ’s had been shorted out , so she would have been too far away .   
Staying out of Valefor ’s earshot , possibly .
“
He cancels out powers .
”
“ You ca n’t really cancel out being Case fifty - three , ” Sveta said .   
“
You ’d better get back while I get patched , if your forcefield is weird .
”
I could have clarified , but I just nodded .   
“ Good luck .   
Be safe .
”
“
You too .
”
My aura back on blast , I flew across the street , then back toward the fighting .   
March and her band of oddballs had been on the far side of Valefor
’s cluster of capes .
The large thing had fallen over , one hand planted on the ground near some of the civilians .   
March ran up its arm , ducking and using momentum to slide up the slope of the arm as a bony claw reached for her .
She ran along the shoulders , cutting as she went , leaped as the head sank into the morass of the body and became two avian skulls that pecked at the air , and then came down , stabbing her rapier into the chest and dragging the point against the giant thing ’s torso , cutting as she went down .   
The blue - purple - black watercolor spread in the wake of the blade
’s tip .
She pulled it free , stabbed at a reaching hand , and used it to reorient her fall .   
She landed hard , her feet planted on either side of a screaming teenage girls’ head .   
A slight misstep , and she would have caved in the poor girl ’s face .
March snapped her fingers and flicked with her blade .
At the shoulder , where the long cut had started , there was a flare of the watercolor spray .   
Purple and blue , with deep shadow in the midst of it .
Her rapier swept out , pointing .   
She called out , “ Rain !
”
The flare was tracing along the line she ’d cut like a flame down a cartoon bomb ’s fuse .
“ I ca n’t !
”
Rain called out .
The ‘ fuse’ reached its terminus .   
What had been a flare became a fierce explosion , right down at the base of the breaker .
I flew toward it , bringing out the Wretch , so I could catch it if it toppled onto March and the civilians .   
It did n’t , falling backward and dissolving as it did .
The breaker form dissipated , and there was only the Fallen with the demon themed skull mask , tipping backward to land on his ass .   
March plunged her rapier into his chest , then flicked it up , toward his throat .
“ It would have been perfect if that had also cut it in two , Rain , ” March said .   
“
It was still perfect , but in a lesser way .
”
“
Can you not use my name ?
” he asked .   
“
And Amaymon nullified my power .
”
The Fallen was patting his chest where he ’d been stabbed .   
He touched his throat .   
Intact , but the line of watercolor marked him .
“
Valefor used your name , ” she said .   
She snapped her fingers .   
“
And you did n’t give me another one .
”
Still floating in the air , I could see the flare appear at the breaker Fallen ’s chest .   
He brought his hands to it , quick , frantic , then tried to pat it out .
“
Hey !
”
the Fallen cried out .   
He lurched to his feet .   
“ Stop !
” March was walking away .
“
Hey !   
Fuck !   
Help me !
”
She flourished with her blade and sheathed it , in the very same moment the fuse reached its terminus .   
The explosion was smaller , but it was sufficient to take out the front of the Fallen ’s throat .   
He dropped to his knees , still moving inarticulately , eyes wide and stunned , and then collapsed to the ground .
I-
I did n’t like the killing , or the casual ease with which she ’d done it .   
These were Fallen , but they were low - level Fallen .
I did n’t want to say not to kill , but
… But there were civilians suffering .   
Other things to focus on .
I changed course , flying back to where I ’d been .   
I continued down the street .   
I was putting the bulk of the lopsided engagement behind me , passing by Rain , by two twenty - ish capes with steel - gray hair , and that meant I could fly faster .   
I kept my eyes on the people and goings - on behind me .
I found what I was hoping for .   
The screaming , just briefly , changed .   
The aura extended through the hostages to Mama Mathers , and she affected the hostages in turn .   
I had a sense of my range , and through that , I had a good sense of her location .
“ Rain !
”
I called out .
“
What is it ?
”
“ If she gets me , get people to take out the building .
”
“ You found her ?
” he asked .
I dug fingernails into the doorframe , then activated my forcefield .   
I tore door and part of the frame away from the front of the store .   
It was one of the smaller buildings on the street , and it was styled as a general store .
The screaming trailed off altogether .   
I gripped the damaged wall where the doorframe had been attached , and tore at that too .   
The Wretch struck at other things .
“
She says to stop , ” a voice said .
It was n’t one of the people who ’d been on the ground .   
He was older- one of the soldiers .   
In the eerie quiet , with people whimpering and making small noises , he still had to raise his voice to be heard , with distances .
He was possibly unpowered , and he was holding an axe .   
He was average height , but muscular , and had a slight belly , such that his body looked more like a solid slab than a chest that tapered down to a stomach or had any proper shape .   
His skin was sun - tanned , his hair blond with white shooting through it .   
A bandanna with a demon ’s mouth on it covered his lower face .
“
You ’ve disappointed her , Rain , ” the soldier said .   
Then he said , “ You disappointed all of us .
”
“
For one of the first times in my life , I feel like
I ’m
doing something right , ” Rain said .
“
No , Rain , ” the man said .   
“
She says you might be doing good , objectively , but not right .   
She says … she ’ll surrender herself to your custody .   
She ’ll withdraw her power from everyone here .
”
“ From everyone , ” Rain said .
“ As you wish .
” March put the sword nearer to the man ’s neck .   
He gripped the axe tighter .
“
Do n’t , ” Rain said .   
“
He ’s a relative .
”
She lowered the sword , and she poked the handle of the axe with the tip .   
She said something I did n’t hear .
The soldier dropped the axe .
Rain was kneeling by Erin .   
He placed a hand on a little boy ’s arm , where the boy lay next to her , hands at his ears .
He reached out for Erin , and she pushed his hand away .   
When he stood , it was abrupt .
“
This feels like a trap , ” I said .
Rain approached me .   
He looked at the building , then raised a hand .   
In the recess of one voluminous sleeve , I could see another hand hidden within .
“
What is it ?
”
“ One person , ” he said .   
“ I think .
”
“
It could still be a trap , ” I said .
“
Yeah .   
But … this gets people out safe .   
If we went after her and she hurt them in the last moment , and if we could n’t turn it off …
” I nodded .
March was walking toward us .
“ You got a look at her .   
She ’s in you ?
”
Rain asked .
“
Barely , ” I said .   
“
She blinded me once or twice .
”
“ Okay , ” he said .
March joined us .   
She put out a hand for me to shake .   
I hesitated a moment , paranoid , then shook it .
“ We have things to talk about , ” she said .   
“
People we both know .   
Power things .
” I nodded .
“ I ’ll go in to get her , ” she said .   
“
I ’m immune .
”
“
So am I , ” Rain said .
“
This is personal for you , ” she said .   
She put a gloved hand on his shoulder .   
“
It ’s the objectivity that makes us valuable to each other .
”
She winked at me , then sauntered indoors .
She bothered me .   
I did n’t like whimsical and show - off in someone that could easily kill .   
The mask and the marching band outfit only marked out the contrast .
“ Immune ?
” I asked .
Rain indicated the two capes with gray hair , a young man and woman .   
Both had eyepatches , the steel - gray hair , and costumes with white and black .   
Chris’ age , or a bit older .   
“ Dino and Enyo .   
They ’re multi - triggers , and they ’re also twin triggers .   
One of their powers is that they can transplant body parts , with some special rules .   
I ’m borrowing someone else ’s eyes and ears , and a few other bits , so she can touch me and make it hurt , but it ’s dulled , and she ca n’t do anything else .   
The transplant recipient is back at our base , sedated .
”
“
All multi - triggers ?
” I asked .
“
She … collects them .   
I guess .   
She studies them .   
It ’s supposed to be important .
”
Rain was looking back in Erin ’s direction .   
She had the little boy with her , and two adults .   
From the resemblance , a sibling and her parents .   
She and they all looked like anyone might after having seen things that had them screaming for ten or fifteen minutes straight .   
Weary , eyes wide , defensive .
But , all that in mind , she seemed to find refuge in her parents .
“
What- ” I started .
“
This power I lost .   
Do I get it back ? ”
“
Yeah .   
I got mine back after ten minutes or so .
” Rain nodded .
“
What happened with Erin ?
”
“
The Fallen ruined it .   
I ruined it .   
She would n’t leave .   
I could n’t stay .
”
“
I ’m sorry .
”
“ Do n’t let me hurt Mama .   
I ’d do it in a stupid way that might get people hurt , ” he said .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
I nodded slowly .   
“
One day , maybe you return the favor on that .
”
He made a small , amused sound .   
Aside from a laugh here or there , at the bad cape names , or a good moment with Tristan , I was n’t sure I ’d ever seen that from him .
“
Sure , ” he said .
“
All set , coming down !
”
March called out .   
“
We ’re taking this slow .
”
“
What would you have done , if she had n’t called it off ?
”
Rain asked .
“
Controlled collapse of the structure , ” I said .   
“
If she had hostages in there , I ’d set it up so she ’d have to tell me .
”
The whiteness in my eyes flared up .   
I rubbed at one eye , uselessly .
“
There ’s a chance she ’d throw their lives away to fuck with you , ” Rain said .
I drew in a deep breath , sighed .   
“
Yeah .   
That was a risk .
”
“ With some people , you do n’t get to win , ” Rain said .   
“
She ’s that kind of person .   
Be careful .
” I nodded , folding my arms .
“ I like the costume , ” he said .   
“ March told me I should n’t be so negative all the time , so I figured I ’d say it .   
I feel like I ’ve missed a lot .
” I winced .
“
What happened ?
” he asked .
“ Damsel happened .
”
“ Damsel ?
” he asked .   
“
Is she okay ?
”
“
She ’s alive and mostly intact ,
” I said .   
“ Damage to her prosthetic .   
But someone else is dead .
”
“ Shit .   
Is it-
” I could hear March .   
“ I ’ll catch you up on particulars later .   
But you should know , because we ’re going to have to explain it to Looksee .
” Rain nodded .   
“ Shit .
” March emerged .   
She had Mama Mathers wrapped in a bedsheet , which was bound with cord that had tassels on the end .   
Something from her costume , it seemed .
I did n’t know or trust March .   
“ Is it her ?   
That ’s Mama Mathers ?
”
“
It ’s her , ” Rain said .   
“
I ’ve seen her enough to know .
”
“ You and I need to have a conversation about your power , ” March said .   
“ The emotion power .
”
“ I forgot to turn it off while you were inside .
”
“ I know what it does , ” she said .   
“
It ’s not strong .
”
“
It ’s never strong .
”
“
But it ’s not useless either .   
Nearly useless , ” she said .
March walked the Fallen leader out to the street .   
From the other end of the fight , Sveta had Valefor , the wig stuffed in his mouth and tied in place with lengths of hair knotted together .   
Her head seemed slim without ears or hair to bulk it out .   
She looked more intense in expression and demeanor , her ‘ scalp’ , the sides of her head and her neck formed of the muscle - like gatherings of tendrils .   
Everything was bound down firm with the metal rings , only the shortest of tendrils curling up and out , an inch or two long , each .
The boy of the eyepatch pairing had a syringe with him .   
He looked grim as the girl
-his
sister , I was assuming- reached out to wrap her fingers around Mama Mathers’ arm .   
She flinched back .
The boy held out the syringe , and the girl depressed the plunger to squirt some out .
They inserted the syringe and injected the contents .   
Mama Mathers slumped , and then collapsed into waiting arms .
Rain nodded , watching .   
Capricorn and the others were catching up , with Capricorn reaching out to grab Rain ’s hand as he reached his friend .   
The soldier from before was shackled , the pair with eyepatches went to March ’s side .
The civilians were a herd of people , wounded and scared .   
Some approached us .   
Others backed off .   
I had to wonder about the latter group .
“
We ’ll reunite with Narwhal ’s group , to give or get backup , ” Capricorn said .   
“
Then we cut across … just about everything , and we evacuate out .
”
“
Sounds good , ” March said .
“ We ’ll help Weld if he needs it , ” Capricorn said .
I weighed the alternatives .   
There were n’t any great answers .   
Going it alone and trying to get to Gilpatrick ’s group meant we could be intercepted , and it left the others fighting a nasty sort of fight , where guns were being brought into things .   
Going to the others meant possible problems could complicate things .
The practice of getting ourselves to the western edge of the wider settlement was a bit of a herding game , keeping a dozen traumatized people moving , while simultaneously managing our hostages , Valefor and Mama Mathers .   
Half of the group kept gravitating in the pair ’s direction , and the other half seemed scared of them , even when they were bound and tranquilized , respectively .   
Erin seemed to do more with an active focus , so she took on some of the cheerleading duties , especially with the younger ones .
One of the Fallen groups was led by a cape with a horse ’s head and a dozen shadowy duplicates in his company , all connected together by a mess of black lighting with weirdly curved arcs .
In any other circumstance , the Fallen would have been losing against the Wardens’ bench team and young members , but there were twenty or so civilians with them , and the civilians had assault rifles , and the Fallen capes in their group seemed both confident and costumed enough to be of some importance .
There was a flanking group of the Fallen who ’d fallen back and were taking cover by a building .   
Some Clan capes were mixed into the group .   
Guns were pointed in our general direction as we emerged , but the guns immediately pointed skyward as they realized who we had with us .
That effect seemed to sweep over the Fallen .   
I made special note of the Fallen who were n’t immediately going still and quiet .   
There were ones in elaborate costumes , many with tattoos of text or numbers down their arms .   
They ’d be the leadership .
The one with the horse head mask was n’t backing off , either .   
He just gathered his shadowy clones around him .
I kept my distance from the rest of the group , floating out in front , the Wretch active .   
March was doing much the same , but without the benefit of invincibility .   
The rapier was extended out , pointing at the people with guns .
Hollow Point ’s capes were on the fringes , gathered like they had when Advance Guard had turned up in Cedar Point , with a divide marking the distinction between Prancer ’s side of things and the others .   
Beast of Burden
’s group , minus both Beast of Burden and Damsel , a twenty foot gap with only three capes in it , and then Prancer ’s assembly , with an injured Moose , an injured Velvet , Bitter Pill
’s group with Bluestocking frothing at the mouth , and the Speedrunners .
I recognized the three capes in the no man ’s land as Love Lost , Snag , and Cradle .   
The clients who ’d paid for this whole thing , with the aim of getting Rain in the midst of the chaos .   
If they had an assassin , I could n’t tell who it was .   
Nobody seemed especially out of place .
It was my first proper sighting of Cradle .   
He wore a bodysuit and an elaborate sculpted mask with a hand worked into it , fingers and thumb curled into claws , worked into his face and around his eyes and nose as if seen from the side .   
His bodysuit had much the same design , white hands against black mesh fabric .
More noticeable was the mech , if it could be called that .   
He stood on a platform that looked like an outstretched hand .   
A framework of six mechanical arms and four giant hands extended out and around the platform .
With our arrival , the gunfire had stopped .   
The heroes’ side was n’t sending any volleys or attacks out , now that the Fallen seemed more subdued .
Someone on the Fallen side said something , and guns were put down .
“
It ’s over !
” Capricorn shouted .   
“ Stand down !
”
They were rule - breakers , killers , child kidnappers , addicts , and worse .   
They included racists in their number without flinching , because it served their ends .   
They ’d celebrated the end of the world , where billions had died .   
Maybe tens of billions or more , depending on how much damage Scion had done to parallel worlds .
If they did n’t listen- if they even got desperate , this would be a disaster .
Please stop , I thought , even as I simultaneously thought about what I ’d need to do if they snapped .   
When they snapped .
I had zero faith they ’d back down .   
By body language alone , it seemed Rain felt the same way .
I watched as the first one stepped away from cover , hands raised .   
Others followed .   
They glared , looked tense , even said coarse things .
What was the catch ?   
The trap ?
Not because they were outnumbered .   
They ’d always been outnumbered .   
That left me considering other traps , along a broader line .   
Access to certain people ?   
Would Valefor reveal his eyesight power when people like Narwhal were close ?   
Did Mama Mathers hope to catch someone important with her power ?
Or was it more mundane ?   
Surrendering and going to the overtaxed courts could be a way for them to get a voice , with a wealth of attention .   
If the lawyers and administration on our side was n’t up to things , and if the Fallen matched it by playing things particularly well , then they could walk away more or less free , with many more followers .
I heard Rain and Capricorn exchange words .   
Rain turned toward Sveta and I and subtly indicated what he and Capricorn were talking about .   
Snag was staring us down from the far end of the battlefield , with hilly , rocky ground between us , the trees and Wardens to the left , and the assembled Fallen and their allies to the right .
“ March reached out to him before she reached out to me .   
He knows who she is , which … is n’t great .
”
“ You think he knows who you are ?
” Sveta asked .
“
We ’ll see , I guess , ” Rain said .
Prancer had emerged from Cedar Point ’s group , and was approaching heroes , hands raised .
If I accepted that things were going reasonably well here , this was a good outcome .   
Civilians had been hurt , people had died , but Prancer had n’t achieved his win , and Snag ’s group was n’t going to get their opportunity .
If I accepted it .   
I could n’t bring myself to .
There were powerful capes here .   
Mama Mathers had n’t had enough people defending her .   
Had it been that she ’d been caught off guard by Rain being prepared ?   
Or was my initial impression of this being a trap correct ?
What did she want and what did she get ?
I heard a commotion .   
Noises of surprise and alarm .
The Fallen who had been turning themselves in were now turning on heroes .   
People were picking up guns .
The number of heroes there had diminished .   
Heroes had disappeared .
What followed was like dominoes falling , as the trap fell into place .   
Narwhal created her crystalline forcefields , only for the forcefields to change tint .   
The horse - head cape sent a duplicate her way , and she was n’t able to get her forcefields up or into place in time .
From that , I knew the culprits of this turnaround .
More heroes were disappearing .   
A member of Prancer ’s group threw something into the midst of their group , and that something exploded .   
The explosions repeated , one after another , at steady intervals .
The other-
From our first briefing on them , we ’d know they had a guy who could appear at our most vulnerable point and catch us off guard .
I turned away from the spectacle in front of me , looking for the one who might be coming after the ones who ’d gotten Mama Mathers and Valefor .   
Behind us , to the sides-
In the midst of us .
Secondhand looked average , with flat , opaque goggles and a flat top cap , but he flickered intensely with afterimages and suggestions of places he might be in the future .   
The images were violent enough he looked ready to burst , and he was right in the middle of our group .   
I swung a punch , and he moved with enhanced speed , ducking it .
The quick movement pushed him over the brink , or so it seemed .   
He detonated , and everything moved like it was slow motion , as I was thrown off my feet , the wind knocked out of my lungs .   
Others were shoved back and away from him too .   
My skin felt like it was tearing apart , because the slow motion was real , and different parts of me were slowed , while others were n’t .   
My lower body was more affected , as was the part of me closer to the front .
It hit everyone except for Mama Mathers , who Secondhand zipped over to , to catch out of mid - air , and Valefor , who blurred , hair moving slightly , but the rest of him remained unaffected .
That would be Final Hour .   
The targeted slow - motion , granting a kind of protection .
I used my flight to keep myself from being thrown back too much , canceling out the inertia and then flying toward them .   
I did n’t have long , and with them this coordinated , they ’d dogpile me in an instant .
I went straight for Valefor .
He was still protected as I brought the Wretch out .   
When I punched him , I could feel the Wretch meet that invisible barrier .   
I could see , in slow motion through both the expulsion of Secondhand
’s detonation and
Last Minute ’s protective effect , the destruction of Valefor ’s lower face as the Wretch passed through the barrier .
I could n’t bring myself to kill , even now .   
I canceled out my power of my own volition , when it was clear that I ’d destroyed his jaw .
As one , the hostages we ’d rescued were taking action .   
They moved in near - unison , some reacting to the movements of others by taking up the call .   
They climbed to their feet , and they reached for us , clutching .   
Their expressions were n’t the ones they ’d worn a moment ago .
The disconnection in my thinking and the speed of our immediate reality let me connect that dot too .   
Valefor had n’t managed a secret command .   
He ’d planted one on the group before Mama Mathers had laid them out flat .
Telling them to attack us when we were off guard , or when he gave some signal .   
Erin was coming after Rain .   
So was her little brother , who could n’t have been older than nine .
The slow was wearing off .   
I had only a moment .   
I flew to the others , grabbing them , dragging them away .   
Sveta and Capricorn .   
Capricorn had a grip on Rain ’s arm , so I brought Rain too , my fingers straining as I tried to hold onto three people for just a moment .   
I ’d never tried or even thought about it , but in the instant , I pulsed my forcefield on and off , to try to keep the Wretch from getting enough of a presence to reach out and hurt anyone .
I just needed to carry them for a few seconds .
Capricorn disappeared from my grip , and for an instant , I thought I ’d lost my grip on him .   
and my hand crackled as he did .   
I turned to look , and saw the man with the goggles and mustache pointing his finger at us .
End of Days , I thought , as I headed toward the ground .
He was n’t even a time manipulator .   
I felt deeply offended at that fact , or I must have-
it was a poignant enough feeling that I could feel it even as I took in the magnitude of just how the tides had turned , and how bad a thing that was .   
They ’d hit each of our groups , and they ’d hit us hard .
I heard an assault rifle fire , and others took up the call .   
It was more one - sided , this time , not two sides shooting at each other , but one side shooting at the rest .
I landed on the far side of a slope , with just Sveta .   
I took the moment to try to gather my senses .   
I hurt all over , and I had blood in my eyes .   
The slow - motion effect from Secondhand .
Sveta had a rip in the edge of her face , but she barely seemed to care .   
She was more focused on getting to her feet .
Capricorn had disappeared .   
Damsel was n’t here .   
Chris and Looksee were on the fringes or not even in the area .
I could feel droplets of moisture on my bare skin .
Rain .
I flew close to the ground , using the hill as cover , Wretch out in case a stray bullet came my way or cut through the dirt .   
I peeked around the edge of the hill
’s slope .   
My eyes took in the scene at a glance , and partway through that glance , the scene changed .
Darkness .   
No sun shining through overcast clouds .   
Only darkness .   
Light leeched in through some other way , giving just enough to outline the surroundings .
The air smelled like ash , and it was dry enough that it felt like my mouth and body were being leeched of moisture .
End of Days .   
He ’d caught me , seeing me before I ’d seen him .
My heart was pounding .   
I could n’t bring myself to speak , because I was afraid I ’d scream .   
The best case scenario was that at this vital , critical moment I ’d been shunted out and away , to some strange , dark place .
The worst case scenario was that it was a permanent shunt .
A small sound escaped my throat as I looked around .
A minute passed .
Two minutes .   
When my eyes played tricks on me through the darkness , I saw Valefor ’s jaw shattering .   
I imagined the battlefield , as it had been .
Anger took over the devastation and surprise .   
I fidgeted .   
I adjusted my costume .   
I flew around in circles , trying to get a sense of what this place was like .   
I stopped when I flew into a tree
I could n’t see .
I watched as the light grew brighter , as if it shone in through invisible cracks that were widening .   
The cracks soared tall and wide , and the light flooded in , blinding .
I was hauled out of that dark , strange world and back into my reality , and I felt the change in air pressure , the moisture of the drizzling rain .
and I saw that things had happened in the meantime .
Sveta and Capricorn were fighting side by side , with Love Lost and a crowd of controlled civilians between them and Rain .   
The presence of the mob of Valefor
’s
affected hostages kept Sveta from getting to any of us , and complicated her skirmish with Love Lost .   
Two of March ’s group members were part of that same crowd , trying to fend the civilians off , and they were n’t trying to be gentle about it like Sveta was .
Rain , meanwhile , was trying to fight Snag .   
Snag was above him , pushing him to the ground , knee on Rain ’s stomach .   
He ’d destroyed one of Snag ’s arms and his two good arms were at the remaining , damaged one , which had a slice taken out of it .   
His other two mechanical arms were gripping Snag ’s normal arm , no longer encased in the giant , oversized prosthetic part .   
Even with their combined strength , the two mechanical arms were losing , cracking and splintering under the pressure .
This was the chaos Snag had wanted .
I flew to him , praying I would n’t get another End of Days timeout .
I was halfway to him when Rain ’s arms broke .
The blades fixed in the midst of the breakable shells continued up and out , piercing Snag ’s forearm and scissoring the space between them as his weight came down and made them shift .
Snag hauled back , pulling away , swinging his damaged prosthetic arm , while holding his damaged regular arm out .   
Blood poured from the ragged wounds in his arm .   
One of the blades had gone in one side and out the other .
In any other day , any other circumstance , I never would have imagined I ’d have let this go .
But others needed help .   
Rain was mostly in the clear , as he and Snag parted .   
Sveta and Capricorn were n’t .
I flew down to where Sveta had been pulled to the ground .   
Her balance was n’t good , and when she was brought down , it was hard for her to find her feet again .   
Once I touched down in the middle of the pack of people , it was a question of getting people back without hurting them too badly .   
I grabbed her and used flight as much as anything to haul her up and away , so we were above the fighting .
It was a vantage point for me to see Rain facing off against Snag .   
He ’d hit Snag with a crescent blade , and the man had a line of silver across face and shoulder .   
He did n’t move , and blood continued to seep down his arm and hand .
Sveta reached over , grabbed grass , because it was the only thing to grab , and hauled herself to the ground over there , to where she could talk to Rain or help Snag .
I flew down to Capricorn .   
Love Lost leaped up at me , intercepting .   
Her initial contact broke through the Wretch .   
Her mover power let her connect to me despite the interruption in her course .   
I felt her claws scrape my breastplate .
I punched her , and she dropped down and away , landing amid people .
Rain had hit Snag again .   
Keeping him from moving .
On my second try , I got to Capricorn .   
I pulled him free , holding him with both hands , my arms straining .
I saw Love Lost get to her feet , reaching for her mask .
I saw her sway and then fall , like the lights had gone out .
Snag had already fallen .   
Either he ’d been hit , or he ’d elected to try moving , because one of the silver lines had split .   
His neck was gouged where it joined the shoulder , a wound deep enough it should have exposed shoulderblade and collarbone .   
It did n’t , because the blood was thick , and his beard was dense .
Rain was on the ground .   
In the distance , perched on a hill , Cradle slumped on his platform .
The drizzle became rain , punctuated by gunfire .   
There was fighting everywhere , and even the people that were holding back were hitting pretty damn hard now .   
Not dissimilar to how I had with Valefor .








Capricorn ’s weight tore him out of my grip , helped by the fact that I was lost enough at recent events that I ’d almost forgotten I was holding him .
He fell ten or so feet and landed in a wet field .   
The field was set on a slope and he slid a few feet before his feet found traction .   
Ahead of us , Love Lost had already slumped to the ground .   
Nothing to do with the fact that I ’d hit her-
everyone in Rain ’s cluster had dropped .
I could try as hard as I was able and it was insignificant , whether it was holding onto Capricorn , talking to Ashley , or hitting Love Lost .   
It did n’t feel like I was having an impact on things , and I ’d cornered and help catch Mama Mathers , the one in charge .
I liked things when they were simple .   
I could pick the biggest or most important target , remove them from the equation , and things would be better .   
It was what I ’d done with Mama .   
It was what I ’d done with Valefor , smashing his face in .
It was harder to justify causing that kind of damage to Mama Mathers , when we ’d needed her for a trump card against the greater conflict , and when so many long - duration powers kept running when the user was incapacitated or killed .
Not that it had worked .   
The Speedrunners had her and were escorting her to safety , the hostages were now both hostages and hostiles at the same time , and the fighting was more vicious than it had been before .
“
Get Rain , ” Capricorn said , below me , barely audible over the shouting and the echo of ceaseless gunfire .
“
On it , ” I heard Sveta , just as I started to fly .
Her handling it was faster and safer than me taking action .   
I dropped from the sky to land beside Tristan , crouching to use the slope for some measure of cover .
“
In over my head , ” Tristan murmured , not hunching over so much as he slid down , resting against the slope with his arm back to prop himself up slightly .
“
You mean the scale of this ?
” I asked .
“
Yeah , ” he said .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
I had some more exposure to the really bad stuff than Capricorn did , but I could sympathize .   
I ’d seen something like this with the Slaughterhouse Nine , but I had n’t been there for the duration of it .   
That situation had been fewer individuals , but the individuals had been worse .   
In both cases , it kind of made things easier .
I ’d been there for Leviathan , but that did n’t really translate to a small - scale war .
Sveta returned .   
A moment later , she dragged Rain to us .   
I pulled Rain close , and reached beneath the collar of his outfit to touch my fingertips to his throat .
“ Alive , ” I said .
Something exploded nearby .   
Damp ground was sent skyward , and joined the rain in pattering down around us , speckling everything .
Sveta turned her face skyward , rain running down face and the curling leaves or tentacles of her mask .   
She had n’t collected or put on her wig again , which made her silhouette seem incomplete .   
In contrast , I hunched over slightly , my hood keeping the rainwater out of my eyes .
“ I know
I ’m
kind of the leader , ” Capricorn spoke , his voice quiet , “
But I ca n’t think straight like this .
”
“ I know , ” I said .   
My eyes scanned what I could see of the battlefield , while my back remained to the worst of the fighting .   
March and her group had backed off , the heroes were holding position at the woods to our left , and the Fallen were gathered across two farmhouses and the surrounding structures and fences , the two big buildings about two hundred feet apart .   
They were using them for cover , and as a place to drag their wounded .
Prancer ’s group was having a harder time , further north .   
They had some vehicles they ’d used to approach this area , but battle damage had rendered the vehicles immobile , and the trucks and cars did n’t offer much when    they were trying to protect themselves from both hero and Fallen .   
Compared to the defensive line that Vista and Narwhal could provide , and the actual structures the Fallen had , the vehicles were n’t much , and the group had to work to huddle in the half - circle of vehicles .
Not that we were in a better situation .
The Valefor - controlled hostages filled the space between it all .   
The group was shrinking as hostages charged after one group or another and were incapacitated or trapped .
“
If we do n’t have a plan I want to go to Weld , ” Sveta said , quiet .   
Her expression was grim , her face paler than usual in the gloom , damp with water .
“
It ’s a plan , ” I said .   
I tried to sound confident .   
“
We go to the heroes .   
We back them up .
” Sveta nodded .
Capricorn twisted around , looking at the situation behind us and to our right , where the heroes were .   
Orange lights began to flow across the gap , like fat , lazy fireflies .
Guillotines of ice or hard crystal flew from the heroes’ side into the mass of hostages .   
The guillotines weaved between the hostages , avoiding them , and slammed into the farmhouse the nearest group of Fallen were using for cover .   
A moment later , the guillotines disappeared , and the section of wall sagged without breaking .
Narwhal ’s forcefields .
The Fallen cape with the horse
’s
head mask or helmet was facing Narwhal head - on , again .   
He created shadow duplicates , and they struck out at the forcefields as the things hurtled past or toward them .   
The effect was minor , changing the courses of the fields slightly , but as each construction tore past them , cleaving shadow duplicates in half , seeming to even hit the source of the duplicates , the guy persisted , and he produced duplicates faster than the fields cut them down .
Other capes in Narwhal ’s group were turning focus onto him , and yet he was staying in the fight .
One of the lieutenants or leaders of a sub - family , it seemed .
Capricorn ’s wall snapped into place , blocking my view .   
We hurried along it , using it for cover against gunfire , with Sveta lunging ahead to the far end of the wall with Rain in one of her arms .   
Capricorn lagged behind some , but he had to travel on foot .
We reached the treeline .   
Two capes knelt by Rain .
“
It all went to shit , ” a cape I recognized as Fluke reported .
“
I noticed , ” I said .
I heard a grunt from Bay , a cape younger than me with a tower shield , and saw him struggling .   
A shadow duplicate of the horse - head Fallen was perched on his shield , reaching down to grab him by the helmet .   
Bay ’s mask was meant to open , but the jet black form of the heavyset Fallen ’s shadow was gripping it , holding it closed , and making his weight fully apparent .
Another cape blasted him , and he dissolved into wisps of shadow .
I moved to a tree I could use for cover , and assessed the situation .   
I could see a shadow become not - shadow , at the same time the real Fallen became shadow .   
He could swap places with any of his active shadows , and he was able to make them quickly , with those zig - zagging cords of darkness .
“ Sveta , ” I said .   
“ We might need you to do the flag trick .
”
“ Against a human ?
” she asked .   
“
I ’d hurt or kill him .
”
“ You do n’t have to , but- ”
Two more duplicates appeared .   
The cords of energy were dense enough near the frontline that it seemed like he could create duplicates near us at will .
“
It ’s Seir !
”
Narwhal called out .   
“
He had a kill order .   
If you ’re willing to kill , this is a time it ’s
okay ! ”
Seir .   
I ’d heard something about him some time ago , but not in the context of his powers or position in the Fallen .   
The Mathers family kidnapped people , and Seir had taken a kidnapping victim for a ‘ wife’ , to use a loose definition of the term .   
She was one of the ones who had escaped , and her story had been one of a few things that had marked the turn in the wider public perception regarding the Fallen .   
After that , and some similar stories , the public and started to see them less as detestable pranksters and more as the horrific cult they were .
And from what little I could remember of her story- “ He deserves to die , ” Rain said .
“
Okay , ” Sveta said .   
Quieter , she said , “ I do n’t think I can bring myself to kill again .   
I ’m sorry .
”
Bay was being harassed again .   
Narwhal was flanked by two copies , and a cape used a tinker gun to obliterate one while narrowly missing Narwhal , while a forcefield appeared in a position that bisected the other .
Bullets hit trees and pinged off of the forcefields Narwhal had created to give the heroes cover .   
Each time a forcefield was hit , it briefly became brighter , the edges and lines standing out in bright purples and blues .
“
I think the cords are counting as living tissue !
”
Vista called out , from a point in the group of heroes I could n’t immediately see .
Behind Seir ’s living self , Imp appeared .   
She jabbed out with a taser , and she touched only the shadow that he left behind .   
It swung a punch , and she ducked , backing away as four of the ten active shadows turned on her , surrounding her .
The Undersiders were here .   
I was n’t sure how I felt about that .
Capricorn ’s walls sprung up just ahead of where Narwhal ’s forcefields were , and she canceled the forcefields .
“
Thank you !
”
Narwhal called out .   
When she went on the offensive , it was with more fields and projectiles , less intent on Seir himself , and more intent on cutting through the cords that arced up into the air and down into the ground .   
Seir ’s numbers began to decrease .
A localized storm of power came tearing at us from an angle , like a tornado , but less of a cone and more of a sphere , with a bright green tint toward the center .   
Narwhal had to stop her offensive to layer forcefields between herself and the sphere .
One of Parian ’s stuffed animals marched out into the field just beyond the trees , and was immediately swarmed with three Seirs .
“
I know
I should
, but- ” Sveta said .
“
It ’s fine , ” I said .   
After Ashley , I was n’t about to push Sveta to test a boundary .   
I had n’t known Ashley ’s boundary had been as tenuous as it was .   
I had more of an idea with Sveta .   
I wanted to jump into the fray , but I was n’t sure what I could do .
Rain groaned , to my right .   
I turned my attention to him-
one cape was helping him to stand .
“
Do you know Seir ?
” I asked .
“
He ’s an asshole , ” Rain said .
“ We ca n’t seem to touch him .   
He just dodged an attack from behind , ” I said .
“
What color are his eyes ?
”
Rain asked , too battered and out of it to really stand or focus on the fighting .
“ Yellow , ”
Bay called out .
“
He teams up with another cape in the family , they ’ll be someone in the background with glowing eyes .
”
Narwhal began attacking with a different angle , aiming at one of the farmhouses .   
Seir ’s real self twisted around to look .
Rain filled us in , in a voice that made it obvious he was still hurting from his fight with Snag .   
“
That ’s Ahrima .   
She gives him danger sense and boosted perceptions by giving up hers .   
She was supposed to be one of
Mama ’s helpers , she traded and paid for capes who could protect her if she needed it , but Ahrima did n’t work for her .   
We still kept her around for others .   
Get him while she ’s distracted .
”
Narwhal ’s focus was on keeping the thinker - augment Fallen on their heels .   
I looked at the battlefield .
“ Vista !
”
I called out .   
“ Open space to the right !   
Keep gunfire away !
”
“
Yep !
”
I heard .
I took off .   
I flew low to the ground , my soaking wet costume making me feel heavy enough I might be pulled down into a crash landing , even though it was n’t that big of a difference .
As I approached , I could hear the gunfire and see the bullets hit mud , with the occasional eruption of dirt appearing off to the side .   
Where the light hit the rain in the right way , I could see the odd slant of rain , and I knew Vista had my back .
I used the clear route to get as close as I could to Seir before I changed course and flew at him .
Fighting on the ground meant using footing to get the most out of one’ strength .   
A punch delivered from a stance with bad footing was ineffectual .
Fighting in the air meant using the same techniques one did with a leaping or jumping attack , with whole body movements , use of weight , but it was a constant use .   
Delivering an effective attack meant using twists and whole - body rotations , downward or forward force , and timing all movements of the body to work with the flight and where the enemy was at .
I was out of practice , but I was reasonably happy with how I delivered my kick .
I was less happy that he looked past the eyehole of that hideous horse mask with glowing yellow irises and he turned to shadow the moment before my kick caught him across the small of the back .
My kick tore through his shadow
’s midsection , and the upper half reached out to catch me by the throat with shadow hands .   
It had no lower body , and it was keeping up the fight .
Ahrima had given him a bit of help at the right moment .
I had n’t wanted to use the Wretch to hit Seir when Vista could n’t necessarily protect me .   
Now ?   
I could use it like this .   
I let it unfurl , expanding out from me to cover me and extend into my immediate surroundings .   
Teeth , legs , arms , hands , feet , without much in the way of rhyme or reason .
Fuck you for making me do this
, I thought , and I pushed my aura out hard .
The Wretch tore through the shadow and several of the surrounding channels of Seir ’s dark energy .
The Wretch and I began to go on the offensive , adding to the pressure on Seir by removing shadow duplicates and cutting off his power before it could extend too far out .
A bullet hit the Wretch , and I felt it disappear .
Seconds passed , where the painful weight of the Wretch was lifted .   
The danger of the gunfire and powers around me paled in the face of the danger of the feeling .   
It was deceptively exhilarating to have the Wretch gone , no longer available at a heartbeat ’s notice .   
I knew it was temporary and how temporary it was , but when everything else was so heavy , just that one deceptive moment caught me off guard .
I continued to go after Seir , chasing his real self in a mad , dangerous game of whack - a - mole , where the mole always won and the person with the hammer could be shot at any moment .   
The Wretch returned , and a well - timed punch from a shadow
Seir destroyed it a moment later .
The yellow eyes were n’t there all of the time , or even ten percent of the time , but Seir was evasive , capable of creating doubles and swapping places with them constantly .   
He did n’t need danger sense to give us a one in twelve chance of hitting the real him .
Others were joining the fight now .   
A Fallen cape or one of the bikers was approaching , grown tall , his flesh alternating between something that seemed hard , like calcified armor plates , and flesh that seemed too soft and fluid .   
Another was approaching with arms raised above her head , and she seemed to be the source of pitch black circles that were now dotting the landscape and air around us .
I just needed to tag Seir at the same time the danger - sense cape was distracted .   
I needed to do it soon , before he had help .
Forcefields flew past me .   
Narwhal .   
The forcefields that did n’t hit Seir ’s copies arrived between us and the Fallen capes , then stopped on the spot and rotated , forming a wall of crystal to bar their path .
I heard the impact as the big cape hit the crystals , and I saw the colors flare , brighter than they had when the bullets hit them .   
The portal cape was running around to try to get around the wall , and was stymied when the wall moved with them .
I destroyed two more shadow copies .   
A projectile I only barely saw destroyed another two with one shot .
We ’d reduced it down to three Seirs .   
I went after one before more duplicates could spring into being , hit it , and reduced it to tufts of shadow .
The big guy battered through Narwhal ’s shield .   
He broke into a run , long limbs stretching and heavy feet pounding against the ground , charging me .
A forcefield hurtled into him , but this forcefield had a passenger .   
Narwhal rode it , and she leaped off as the big guy caught the slice of crystal .   
She landed , and her hair was still settling around her when the forcefields sprung into being to her left .
I punched another two Seirs , well aware I was fighting an uphill battle .
They had formed so each forcefield was a foot apart , and the stack of forcefields overlapped with the fluid armor brute , dividing him neatly into roughly eleven slices .
But the distraction had bought Seir time to make more doubles .   
With yellow eyes glowing , he evaded the moving forcefields and changed just before new forcefields could cut him in half .
Two more Fallen and one biker joined the skirmish , jumping onto the black portals , which served to send them flying into the next black portal .   
Each portal was a kind of teleportation gimmick , but they littered the area and were letting the Fallen maneuver with ease .   
I saw their eyes glow like
Seir ’s did , and their focus was mostly on me .
That focus was partially by design .   
My aura still blasted everyone nearby , and that drew their attention .
Still … fuck this .
“ Narwhal ! ?   
Can I leave you ! ?
”
I called out .
“ Go !
”
I flew away from the scene .   
I looked back , saw Vista , and saw her give me the go - ahead .
Ahrima was my target .   
I knew her general location , and she was too dangerous as a force multiplier .
I heard a series of gunshots nearby , and changed direction .   
The first gunshots did n’t hit me , because Vista was altering trajectories , but as I spotted the shooter , I saw them firing recklessly , putting bullets in the air at random .   
By pure luck , the shooter was able to land one shot and hit the Wretch .
My change of direction made me harder to track .   
I flew back and down , touched the ground , and flew toward the sound of the gunfire , trying not to move in straight lines .   
I saw the cover they were hiding behind and flew around it .
Staying low to the ground , I felt the Wretch re - emerge .   
Limbs and digits dug into the ground , and tore up the earth below me .   
My aura roared , the dirt flew around me , and I was within the center , cold and angry .
The shooter had been peering over cover , but the sound of the Wretch carving its way through the ground drew their attention .   
They turned my way just in time for me to get in their face .
I swatted my hand through the air , and the Wretch followed suit .   
The difference was that my hand hit air , and the Wretch hit the shooter ’s gun hand .
The gun was torn from their hand and sent flying into the dark , wet field behind the shooter , and several of their fingers were broken in the process .
I hated guns .
I changed course , flying out toward Ahrima again , rising higher as I did .   
I could see the rank and file Fallen soldiers , and I could see the Fallen with powers .   
There was a concentration that suggested they were defending a car .
I flew at the car , and given how my course went from the shooter I ’d disarmed to the vehicle , I approached at an angle where they were n’t really expecting trouble .   
It let me hit the roof of the car with the Wretch , tearing it off , and between the flying pieces of roof and the aura , Fallen were left ducking for cover .
I saw the girl who could only be Ahrima , eyes glowing yellow , her demon mask featuring an eye on the forehead .   
She was roughly Kenzie ’s age .
My hesitation cost me .   
Fallen rallied , and soldiers opened fire .   
I spun in the air and spiraled down , and not because I was delivering a heavy hitting attack from the air .   
An intense pressure caught my arm , and my first thought was that a power had made a black hole open up in my bicep , with the muscle , bone , and skin being sucked into it .
I landed in the mud , the pressure mounting in my arm .   
I shut off my aura , because I did n’t need to draw attention to myself when I did n’t know for sure what had happened .
My heart beat , and the beat was hard like a hammer hitting concrete , and between that beat and the next , I felt the first hint of pain and realized what had happened .
Just a normal bullet .   
I retroactively strung the events together in my head .   
It had been a burst of fire from something that was n’t a hunting rifle or pistol , three shots , all at once , and Vista had n’t been able to curve the shots away from me .   
One shot had hit the Wretch , and one had hit me .
I remained where I was for a moment .   
While I had the benefit of shock to dampen the pain , I needed to figure out my next step .
I was surrounded by Fallen , I needed to deal with them before Ahrima .
If I was a cop , dealing with people with weapons , it would be okay to shoot first .
These guys had weapons and worse .
My rules were n’t like Sveta ’s rules .   
She never wanted to hurt anyone again .   
I wanted to only hurt people if I thought it through and if it was right , lawful , and if I would n’t regret it .
Fallen were circling the vehicle , approaching me , and I flew at them .   
My aura helped to slow their reactions as I bowled into them .
The collision hurt the soldiers .   
My attention was on the masks in the group .   
I needed to go after the ones with powers .
I saw the first one , and I flew at them , fingers dragging against skin until I touched a strap .   
I grabbed it , brought out the Wretch , and used the Wretch ’s strength to toss them skyward .
Bursts of strength , letting the Wretch start to emerge , but not letting it unfold to its full breadth , reach , and intelligence .
I flew to intercept and brought out the Wretch for a moment , so their legs would hit the Wretch or hit my invincible self as they descended .
If I did n’t break their legs or feet outright , I would at least make it so they could n’t walk for a good little while .
My arm throbbed .   
Each time I became aware of the pain , it was doubly worse than before .
People backed away and used the car for cover against me , and I threw myself at the car .   
I pushed it along wet dirt driveway and I pushed it into the group .
Not that effective , but it did make them relinquish their cover , backing up and spreading out .   
They had guns , but they did n’t fire .
Ahrima was still in the car , which still had its roof torn off .   
She slumped in the driver ’s seat , draped over the wheel .   
Shooting at me would risk shooting her .
I had n’t intended that , but I was n’t about to complain , either .
As a deterrent , it only worked against one select group of people , though .   
Prancer
’s group opened fire on our area , and a bullet hit the hood of the car .   
Mud sprayed as a bullet hit the ground near the Fallen group , and they took that as an indication to retreat toward the house .
I flew to pursue , and someone in the group used their power while the others ran .
A beam , or a column of energy , transparent .   
It enveloped me , and my forward movement stopped when I was only a couple of feet from the group .   
I could fly side to side , and even slip out of the column of energy , but as it centered on me again , I could n’t fly toward the source .
That black - hole pressure in my arm made it feel like the muscles in my shoulder and forearm were being twisted up and wrenched into the wound .   
I pressed a hand against the approximate location of the bullet , and blood oozed between the fingers .
I flew straight down , Wretch out , and I hit the ground with all the strength I had .   
The person shooting the beam lost their footing , found it , and centered the beam on me again .
Even with the Wretch taking the impact , the vibration and the shift in position doubled the pain in my arm .   
For an instant , I wished I could pass out and be relieved of it .
Other thoughts flickered through my mind , almost in the same way that idle thoughts ran through one ’s mind while they drifted off to sleep .   
These were n’t restful thoughts , though .   
It was the people writhing on the ground , and the old conservative woman I ’d rescued .   
It was the graffiti in Hollow Point .
I almost collapsed into that sequence of thoughts in a confused , angry haze .   
I did n’t .   
As I rallied , I felt my thoughts clarify with the images .
I could n’t approach while the beam was locked on me , and I could feel other kinds of pressure mounting , like the head - rush from doing a handstand , but concentrated in my shoulder blades , back , buttocks , calves and feet .
I did as I ’d done when Amy had pursued me , after the barbecue .   
I swung , and I let the Wretch hit the ground .   
Dirt and mud sprayed into the air and sprayed toward the cape with the beam .
The beam kept the stuff from flying into them , but it did n’t stop the clumps and clods from arcing up and over the beam , landing on and around them .
For a moment , they were blinded and left stumbling back by the force of the mud slapping against them .
It was a Fallen woman with a mask that hid most of her eyes and left only the mouth visible .   
Her costume was molded to the body , erasing lines and features in favor of more smooth rubber expanses of ‘ flesh’ like the ones around the eyes .   
Only a few isolated symbols and words were carved into the rubber ‘ flesh’ , painted to be red and angry - looking .
I grabbed her by the rubber between her breasts and lifted her up into the air .   
One - armed , I heaved her around and rammed her into the car
’s hood , hard enough to knock the sense out of her .
A demon loomed in my vision .   
I tensed-
and I saw the demon reach down to the beam demon , applying the taser .
Imp .   
She was the one who had knocked out Ahrima .   
She leaned back , settling into the car ’s passenger seat .
Right .
“
We had the same idea , ” Imp said .   
“ Go after this one .   
I was quicker , y’know .
”
My arm twisted in pain .   
I looked back , and I saw that Seir was dealt with , as were his reinforcements .
“
Oh , you ’re hurt , ” she said .
I was n’t up to talking , so I gave her a curt nod instead .
“ Go get yourself looked after .   
I got her .   
We got her , since you saved me the trouble of having to find out who had the car keys .
”
I winced , in part because of the pain , and in part because it was another thing where it felt like actually changing the course of this greater thing was hard to do .
I ’d broken the Fallen ranks , at least .   
I ’d stalled Seir and then played a part in Ahrima being disabled .   
I ’d have to console myself with that .
I gave Imp another curt nod , and flew back in the direction of the others .
Capricorn had been busy , raising walls between the various fighting factions .   
It was changing the flow of the fight , and for better or for worse , the Fallen were focusing on Prancer ’s group because it was the easiest to hurt .
Weld had reunited with the others , and the other Undersiders , March ’s group , Narwhal ’s squad with Vista included , and my team were all together , hunkered down by the wall .   
I landed , and I dropped to one knee when it turned out
my legs had surprisingly little strength to them .
Sveta and Rain were talking to Narwhal .   
Sveta glanced at me , shot me a smile , and then returned to the conversation .
I was aware that March and Parian were talking , further away from the wall and the group .
Given where I ’d landed , it was really Vista and Foil who noticed and approached me .   
Foil saw the blood , and dropped to my side , reaching to her belt for basic supplies .
“
Thanks , ” I managed .
She glanced back at Parian and March , then turned her full focus to my gunshot wound .   
The wound sucked at my fingers as I pulled them away from the bloody mess .
Vista waved somebody over .   
The wave got Sveta ’s attention , and she     hurried to a spot behind me , where she could support me from behind and look over my shoulder .
“
Sorry , ” I said .   
“
I got reckless .
”
“ My fault , ” Vista said .   
“
I could n’t get something up in time .
”
“
I did n’t leave enough of a gap between me and the people with guns .   
Nothing you could do , ” I said .
The hero from Narwhal ’s group had a first aid kit .
“
That could have hit the artery , ” the cape said .   
“
This is something we can patch up , but you ’re going to need more attention later .
” I nodded .   
“ Thank you .
”
“ You ’re leaving ?
”
Rain asked , voice carrying .   
I followed his line of sight and saw March collecting a bag as her coterie gathered in a group just behind her .
She answered him , “ It seems I ’m not welcome here .   
I ’m
leaving these guys alone , but I ’ll be around until this thing is done .   
We ’ll talk .
”
“
Okay .   
We ’ll talk .
” March saluted , made a sound like she was chuckling under her breath , and ducked beneath a branch as she headed further into the woods .
“
Good riddance , ” Foil hissed under her breath .   
In a different , softer tone , she said , “ It ’s been a long time , Victoria .
”
“ It has , ” I said .   
I did n’t like how my voice sounded , but I could n’t devote the focus to sounding more like a proper wounded superhero .
“
You doing alright these days ?
”
“ Present mess and end of the world aside ?
”
I smiled when I probably should n’t have .
“
Yeah .   
Surprisingly alright , ” she said .   
“
You ?
”
I turned to look at my injured arm .
“
Present situation aside ?
” she asked .
“
Others said you were invulnerable , ” Bay said .
“
Ran into a power dampener earlier , ” I said .   
I turned my head to look over my shoulder at Sveta , who had her hands on my shoulders .   
“
It might have played a role .
”
“ Probably did , ” Sveta said .
I turned to Foil , looking to change the topic ,
“
What ’s the story with this March thing ?
”
“ Long story .   
We ’ll talk later , but- not in polite company , ” Foil said .
I nodded .   
The aborted conversations were rough , when I wanted any conversation at all that could take my mind off the pain .
Capricorn , not in my immediate field of view , reported , “ Threw up some walls .   
Prancer ’s not having a good day .
”
“
Stupid to attack like he did , ” I said .   
I watched as Rachel Lindt emerged from the deeper woods , a mutant dog behind her .
Rachel Lindt was not my favorite person , but Vista raised a hand in a wave , and Rachel returned it , her expression dour .   
I could let this particular sleeping dog lie , if Rachel was willing to do the same .
“
There ’s more to the attack than it might seem , ” Foil said .   
“
The Fallen are growing too fast .   
Thinkers , Tattletale included , concluded they were about to connect with some other groups and lock    up a bigger alliance .   
They would have been too big to take down .
”
“ They needed to communicate with the heroes , ” I said .   
My expression twisted as the hole was pulled closed as part of the stitching .   
They had n’t even taken the bullet out , as far as I could tell .   
I was aware that Rachel Lindt was staring me down with abject antipathy , and it bothered me that I was showing pain in front of her .
“
They could n’t communicate with the heroes .   
The Fallen apparently have allies hidden in the Wardens’ sub - teams , ” Sveta said , her voice a whisper .   
“
By the time thinkers rooted them out , others would have made moves .   
Or at least , that ’s what the Undersiders are saying .
”
“
Yeah , ” Foil said .   
“
This is bad , but the alternatives were worse .
”
“ We did n’t expect it to be this messy , ” Parian added , almost apologetic .   
Foil nodded .
“ You did a good job letting us get Seir , Victoria , ” Narwhal said .   
“ Thank you .
”
I nodded a bit , head bent in a nod ,
“
That was Imp , mostly .
”
Weird words to say .
“ Maybe in part , but there were a lot of Fallen there that were focused on you , not us , ” Narwhal said .   
In a tone that suggested she was n’t going to accept any dissent , she repeated the former , “ Thank you .
”
I nodded my acknowledgement , because saying anything would ’ve meant having to acknowledge it when it did n’t feel wholly appropriate .   
It was Narwhal being a leader and getting everyone in the right frame of thinking .
“
Do we want to take the opportunity to walk away from this ?
” Capricorn asked .
“ You want to run ? ”
Bay asked .
“
No , ” Capricorn retorted , annoyed .   
“ Retreat .   
We have outside resources , ones I wo n’t detail , not when we were just talking about potential Fallen assets in the Wardens , and you guys are Wardens .   
No offense .
”
“ None taken , ” Narwhal said .
“ We can go , hold the wider perimeter , figure out what we ’re doing .
”
A few people talked all at once .   
I was one of them .
The talking died down .
It was Weld who spoke up , clearly enough to be heard .   
“
This might be our one shot .   
Dealing with the Fallen means getting close enough to go after the key members .   
We might not get another chance .
”
“ They have a lot of power synergies , ” I said .   
I swallowed through the pain that radiated from my arm and shoulder , the swallow caught , and I was without words until I could swallow properly and speak .   
I tried to sound normal as I explained , “ The chaos plays a role , because it means they ca n’t coordinate one hundred percent .   
There ’s more room to break up synergies and teamwork than there would be if we pulled back and gave them an hour to talk and sort themselves out .
”
“ I can tell you who the big names are , and who the key lieutenants are , ” Rain said .   
“
I know
a lot- ” “ Rainnnn !
”
The woman ’s voice echoed through the trees , thin and haunting .
“
Cover your ears !
”
Rain said , taking his own advice .   
“
Do n’t look !
”
Do n’t look .
I covered my ears , but I heard whispers even with all sound blocked out .








Narwhal ’s group were some of the more experienced heroes around , hand - picked from teams like Foresight , the Shepherds , and Advance Guard .   
They were veterans with years of experience , many of them ex - Wards who had grown up with their powers .   
The Undersiders had taken over Brockton Bay
’s underworld and had allegedly compromised its overworld , with fingers deep in the pie of government , local business , and the local hero teams .
Now villain and hero sat together , crouching and kneeling on wet grass and in mud , hands over their ears , expressions grim .
We ’d backed off a bit , and now we huddled , with Capricorn erecting more defenses .
Rain had moved his hands from his ears , lowering them .   
Fluke looked at him and then nervously started to lower his hands .   
Rain motioned for him to put the hands back , and Fluke wasted no time in doing so .
Rain had put his hands up only to show us and convey the urgency of it .   
Now he could be our ears , and he had his phone out of his pocket , his fingers tapping on the onscreen keyboard .
The whispers I heard were indistinct , but they came with a return of the white snow in my vision , moving in my peripheral vision and creating shapes that were n’t really shapes , like the way faces could seem to stand out from a pile of leaves or the light and shadow in a cloud .
Rain ’s head turned , and I followed his gaze to look at Rachel .   
Her hands were pressed to her ears , and her mouth was open in an ‘ o’ .   
I saw her stop , mouth closing , her chest expanding as she drew in another breath .   
The water from the branches above poured down onto her , and she did n’t seem to care in the slightest .   
Her shaggy mane of auburn hair was plastered across her face , and aside from rubbing her forearm across the edge of her eye to move the hair so she could peer between the wet locks , she seemed fine with it .
Again , she did the thing with the ‘ o’ shape , and I could tell she was putting a good amount of effort into the sound she was making .
When the mutant dogs responded to her howl , I could feel the low sound run through me , and it was clear the others could too .   
Rain winced in pain , covering his ears again .
Rachel was shouting , but I could n’t hear her with my hands where they were .   
The mutant dogs in the woods moved , running off to our right and left .   
Around the camp .
My arm throbbed , and I was n’t sure I could keep covering my ears , even when the effort was mild and I was hunched over , bringing my head down to my hand more than the inverse .
I chanced a momentary listen , and I could only hear howling .   
Mama Mathers was being drowned out .
Rain typed out his message , and held out the phone for Sveta , Capricorn and I.    Vista and Foil drew close enough , and so they got a look too .
If you see mama you will start to see things . 

If you hear … start to hear things . 

Etc for touch / thinker senses 

She can see / hear / thinker through these things I nodded .   
I ’d known and inferred most of that .
Loose color scheme : white is leader / important Mathers “ Valefor and Mama Mathers , ” I said .
Rain nodded , then typed .
Bamet mutates with a touch .
Permanent physical mental change .
Uses stolen features to alter animals and make them smarter .   
Would be near stables .
“ He wears white ?
” I asked .
Rain nodded .
He typed , and I felt a pang of irritation at the fact that Rain had n’t shared this earlier .   
I could understand that he had n’t been able , but some of this would have been really good to know .
Coronzon pulls himself into portal and builds up strength .
I ve never seen but he comes out messy and big .   
Has cancer / is not active much except in sitting in as elder in council
“
This is the leadership again ?
” I asked .   
“ White ?
”
Rain nodded again .
He was typing more when a dog came barreling out of the woods , straight for us .   
Its mouth was open wide , tongue lolling out the corner , and it howled with the howl momentarily interrupted each time its feet slammed into the earth .
Vista
’s power increased the space between the dog and us .   
The dog might as well have been running on a treadmill , but the treadmill was real ground .
I started to move forward , ready to intercept , and I glanced at Rachel to double check .   
Some of it might have been that she knew her dogs best , and I could use her reaction to know what to do .   
Another part of it was that I knew she had a violent history .
I ’d already made the mistake of letting that go too easily with Ashley .
Rachel , hands over her ears , was approaching .   
She shouted something to Vista , but Vista could n’t hear .
I leaned forward , and I used my good arm to pull Vista down .   
The level of noise the dog was making was unreal , and I could hear shouting and commotion , including Rachel ’s cussing .   
I remained ready to shield the others as the dog lunged forward , faster in running than Vista ’s distortion was extending .
The dog broke free of the distortion and closed the distance .   
I saw the slobber flying , the rain splashing off of its back , and I saw the eyes , recessed in eye sockets framed in spiky bone .
I threw myself to the ground .
The dog leaped over us , and over Capricorn ’s wall .
The Fallen were in the woods , closing the distance to us while we could n’t look or see without risking running into Mama Mathers .
I covered my ears again , and I risked looking .
With my hands over my ears , I could hear my heartbeat , and I could hear the lowest sounds the dogs were making , the impacts when they ran too fast and hit a tree with the broad side of their bodies , and the crashing thumps when they hit one of their targets .
The patter of the rain was gentle and the moisture was cool against my lower face , the light from the overcast sky was mild and softened by the branches overhead .   
But for the conflict , the monster dogs and the mass of people in costume , it could have been a really nice day for a walk in the rain .
It was an odd thought , I knew , but I was struck by the contrast .
I wondered if Chris experienced a bit of this , his headphones muffling the outside world , as he took stock of it .
Strange , too , to have the monster dogs present , but not to be having to deal with them as a horrific kind of opposition .   
I did n’t have to try to get between them and civilians .   
I did n’t have to worry about failing to save a civilian from the dog that had maimed them .
If and when I heard the howling in the distance , I would n’t be reminded that the outskirts of my hometown were being stalked by these kinds of monsters , sometimes with innocents getting hurt .
I really did n’t like Rachel , but … Paradigm shift , I supposed .
Fuck , my arm hurt .   
Pulling me back to reality .   
Civilians were still a concern .   
The first wave looked like Fallen soldiers .   
Others might come .
I took flight , going from a position low to the ground to the upper reaches of the trees .   
I took my hands away from my ears , and the only sound I could hear was the incessant howling of the dogs and the faint static sound of rain against leaves .
Dangerous to use my thinker - one power when Mama could be in the area , but my instinct was that she was n’t .
Now that I was thinking about her , the whispering was back .   
The snow was the same as before .
The power was n’t really a power , but the benefit of flying .   
A bird ’s eye view , being able to see the battlefield from a semi - decent vantage point , provided
I could get up high enough .   
I could see motion through the trees , but I could n’t see much else .
No white .   
Seir had dressed in black – if Rain had continued to talk , would that have been part of it ?   
How set was it ?   
I could imagine the Fallen identifying themselves as closer to the Simurgh sticking to white or silver , while the Leviathan - favoring Crowleys might prefer green .
No
green , no black , no white .   
I was n’t even sure if it was that hard - set , or if my speculations were off - point , but it helped on a level .   
It helped validate my assumption that Mama Mathers would n’t be part of a headlong rush , and I liked even the idea that my enemies’ costumes might be conveniently color - coded .
Valefor and Mama Mathers were scary , or Valefor had been scary , but they were n’t warriors , and they were n’t generals .   
Their weakness in this was that they were subtle players and the small - scale war was n’t subtle .
I descended , aiming for the group where the Fallen were more numerous and the one dog was alone .
One cape , that I could tell .   
She wore a biker helmet , with fragments of helmets worked into her costume .   
Her arms looked like melted plastic , swords with the blades curved into hooks on the end .   
Weld was fond of the design- what the hell had he called them ?   
She was using them to climb the dog , hacking at its face , and missing as it shook and twisted its head away .
There was a limit to what I could do when my arm was hurt to the point my entire body was feeling it .   
I grabbed her by the helmet with the one hand , and pulled her back into a more upright position , until her stomach was exposed .   
I drove my knee into her stomach , and felt some resistance .   
Light armor .
I kept my knee where it was , and flew straight up , twisted around so my bad arm was furthest from her .   
She pulled back , trying to get into a position to hit me or fight back , and I used my grip on her helmet to jerk her head down , until her ass was higher than her head .
My old mantra , from before .   
This was the disorientation .
The issue with her weapons was that they had reach , where the more dangerous part of the weapon was the hook , and I was in too close for her to properly use it .   
Toward the base of the weapon , the melted plastic was sharp in places and jagged , but it was n’t going to gut me .
Hook swords .   
That was what Weld had called them , back when we ’d been on a team together .
She brought the crude base of the hook - sword against my armor , and it caught on the breastplate .   
She used the catch to reposition , twisting around .
I could see that her helmet had changed .   
It had waves and ripples that looked almost like hair , and it had a melted - plastic emblem as part of the visor , appearing where the eyebrows might meet .   
It was no larger than my palm , and looked like a star with the bottom two legs removed , spikes radiating up .
It was my emblem .
The armor I ’d felt at her middle was my breastplate starting to form .   
It was completely formed now .
Faceless , featureless , biker girl wrestled to get to a more upright position , and she leaned back far enough to catch the hook of her right hand on my breastplate .   
She reared back , other arm back , and I did a barrel - roll .
The hook came at me as she fell away , a last - ditch effort to catch herself .   
I brought out my forcefield just long enough to deflect it , and the hook caught on that instead .   
When I put the Wretch back where it belonged a moment later , she fell .
Biker - girl was eerie , because of the black melted - plastic look , the faceless visor , and the fact I had n’t heard her make a sound .
I flew after her , faster than she fell , and I was ready to catch her if she needed it .   
I watched as she used the hook - arms to swipe at the tree branches , trying to find traction .   
She caught one branch with two hooks , and one slipped free of the thinner edge of the branch .   
She swung in a quarter - circle before the other hook came free as well .
She made her descent , hooks finding more purchase , until she found a branch thick and sturdy enough to catch her body weight .
She swung forward , backward , and then lifted the hooks free , performing one flip in the air before landing square on two feet , hooks out to the side .
I hit her a second later , literal flying kick to ribs .   
She bounced off of a tree before collapsing to the ground .   
I winced at the pain in my arm , as the impact from the vibration traveled through my body to the injury .
I flew to her side and checked her vitals .   
The plastic was melting into black ooze , breastplate included .   
I heard and felt her cough and saw her whole - body flinch in reaction .
“ Ribs ?
”
I asked , as I put my hand to her bodysuit - covered collarbone and felt the already wheezy vibration of her breath .   
She nodded , tight .   
I asked , “ Do you have any fight left in you ?
”
She shook her head .
“
You ’re biker , right ?
”
A nod .
“
Stay , ”
I said .   
She slumped back .   
I checked my directions and used Capricorn ’s wall as a reference point , as the wrestling in the air had turned me around .   
I looked down at biker girl , “ Nice descent , by the way .
”
“
Thank you , ”
she said , her voice soft but strangled , before she coughed hard , with more full - body flinches .
“ You guys have got to stop fucking working with the Fallen , ” I said .
“ I- ” she started .
Then I heard her try to scream , and I saw her try to move , as if to get away from something , only for both things to fail .
Mama Mathers .
Rain ’s refresher-
she watched , she heard , and she could pull something like this , to take any of her people out of commission or make them suffer for a perceived failure .
Or to mess with us .   
Like with the breaker .   
Also a biker , now that I thought about it .   
They were expendable in her eyes .
Nothing I could do except deal with Mama Mathers sooner , or pave the way for others to do the same .
I flew to the others , looking for Weld amid the dogs and Fallen , and finding him taking on four unpowered Fallen and one biker .   
The dogs kept their distance while Weld fought , barking and howling with a volume like cannons firing .
“ Go down !
”
I called out .   
“
Getting beat by Weld is better than somehow winning and the dogs coming after you !
”
“ Eat cocks , heathen !
” a Fallen soldier shouted .
I approached at a walk , keeping the guy between Weld and I.   
I saw his agitation grow , as he tried to keep Weld in focus while not ignoring me .   
He could n’t run out to one side either , with the dogs around .
A face in the corner of my eye made my head turn .   
Visual snow .   
The guy ran from Weld and came after me while I was distracted , machete held high .
I hit him with my aura , and I saw his expression change .   
His attack was delayed , thrown off by the surge of emotion , and I flew up a bit to put a foot on his chest , my hand down and ready to smack the blade with the Wretch out if it looked like he ’d cut me .
I used my foot and my flight to push him in Weld ’s direction .   
The Fallen soldier landed on his ass at Weld
’s feet , and Weld stepped on one of his calves .   
I could hear the bone crack .
A young ‘ punk’ Fallen in the group surrendered , dropping to his knees , hands up .   
One Fallen hefted a baseball bat while approaching his surrendering kin , but then backed off as Weld quickly advanced on him .
It hardly mattered .   
Maybe the bat would have been more merciful .   
The surrendering Fallen slumped over and fell to the ground , eyes wide , twitching .   
No screams , only a near - immediate catatonia .
Those who remained looked and saw , and then they turned toward the most vulnerable target they could see- me .
I hit the ground to spray them with dirt and mud , flying back a little , and one of the dogs lunged in , trampling them .
Weld and I remained where we were , checking that nobody was going to get up anytime soon .   
We relaxed when they did n’t .
Well , insofar as I could relax , seeing the person Mama Mathers had taken out .
“ You get Mathered ?
” I asked .
Weld glanced at me , then tapped his ear .   
He turned his head to show me .
No ear canal .   
He ’d welded his ears shut .   
It was one way to do things .
I gestured , and he nodded .   
We headed back to where the others were at the more fortified wall , a short distance into the woods proper .   
Another wall was at the wood
’s edge-
this group had to have climbed it , and beyond it were the two farmhouses that were near .   
The denser settlement was a few minutes of jogging beyond the closest farmhouse .
We ’d have to leave the fallen Fallen where they were .
As I rejoined the others , I could see more signs of fighting .   
Fallen had flanked this group .
Prancer ’s group was struggling , but these capes knew what they were doing .   
Sveta , Narwhal , Vista ,
Capricorn- Rain was just about the only cape present who did n’t have a lot of experience in crisis situations .
Parian was at the far end of the clearing with Foil .   
As she rejoined us , she tossed something at me , levitating it with her telekinesis .   
I caught it .
Cloth set around beads or something hard , with thread binding it shut .   
I saw her tap her ear , and I nodded .
The makeshift earplugs fit snugly , and the cords trailed out a bit .
Rachel looked annoyed .   
She said something , and nobody could hear her .   
Imp laid a hand on her arm , indicating her ear , and she gave Imp a more annoyed look .
I turned to Rain , and waited as he typed his message into his phone .
Missing dog .
I raised a hand , then did my best to indicate with gestures that I ’d look .
If someone or a group of someones was capable of tying up a dog , then there was a chance it was one of the more problematic factors in play .
I used the bird
’s eye view , moving carefully at first , then checking with more confidence as I verified that Mama Mathers was n’t close .
There was movement .   
Something big .   
I flew down to where Rachel could see and indicated a direction .
I flew to the dog .
The dog prowled , the low growls it was making deep enough that I could feel the vibrations in the air , even though I could n’t really hear .   
It was a gangly thing , as Rachel ’s dogs went , and the plates were lighter .   
I wondered if it had started as a chihuahua .   
I was pretty sure breed factored in .
I realized it was focused on something , and flew closer .   
It snapped at me as I got closer , and I flew back and up .
A small movement made the dog jump back .   
It saw me and jumped back again .
I realized what the movement was- a figure , camouflaged .   
The camouflage was dying out , and it was n’t nearly as effective as it had been .
“
It ’s you , ” I said .   
I pulled out an earplug .
“ -get this thing to stop growling at me ?   
You ’re supposed to be strong , ” Chris said .
“
What are you doing this close to the fighting ?
”
“
Get this thing off me !   
What are you , deaf ?
”
I flew down between him and the dog , and in facing the dog , I could see Rachel approaching at a jog .
“
Can you call him off ?
”
I asked , gesturing .
She whistled , and the dog backed off , going to her side .
“
Thank you , ” Chris said .
“
What are you doing here ?
”
“
Keeping an eye on things , trying to be ready with my next form if we need it , ” he said .   
His features were almost visible as he moved and the camouflage shifted .
I looked over in Rachel ’s direction .   
“ Dog spotted him sneaking up on us .   
He ’s friendly .
”
“
Hi friendly
, I ’m
Imp , ” Imp said .
“
Ha ha , ” Chris said , humorless .   
He turned his camouflage - cloaked face my way .   
“
Should I transform ?
”
I considered for a moment , then shook my head .   
In a softer voice , I said , “ The form ’s slow , you said .
”
“
Yeah .   
I could keep an eye on things , though .
”
“ We have someone we ’re trying very hard to avoid keeping an eye on , out there , ” I said .   
“
You should get those headphones of yours on before we go to the others , because we do n’t want to hear her either .
” I heard him rustle .
“
Besides , ” I said .   
“ We might want to move to a phase two kind of approach .
”
“
I did n’t think you guys made that much progress , ” Chris said .
“
Speak for yourself , ” Imp said .   
“ Please .   
I have no idea who you are or what you do , so speak , fill us in .
”
“
Do n’t be annoying , ” Rachel said .
“
You have a really bad gauge of what annoying is , for the record , especially when you bring Yips along all the time now- ” Imp said , indicating the gangly dog .   
“ And
Yips is your worst dog .
”
“
I ’m trying to make him a better dog , like I ’m trying to make you a better human .   
Do n’t be annoying .
”
“
Fine .   
You handle this without my help .
”
“
Fine , ” Rachel said .   
She reached out , then let her hand drop to her side .   
She looked my way .   
“
You found my dog quickly .
” I nodded .
“
Good work .
”
“
Okay .   
Thank you , ” I said .   
There was n’t a follow - up and there was n’t really anything for me to say or ask her , so I turned to Chris .   
“
We did n’t make much headway , but they have a crapton of capes and the Hollow Point guys seem to have crumbled .   
I ’m thinking phase two , but I have n’t brought it up with anyone else .
”
“
Phase two ?
”
Rachel asked .
“
Contain , ” was Chris’ blunt response .
“
Okay , ” Rachel said .
I wanted to explain further , but my eye and ear were somewhat compromised .   
Would Mama hear and adapt ?
That ’d have to do for an explanation .   
I ’d outlined a multi - stage course of action with a list of priorities , and we were already having to skip to the next big phase , without having removed the capes Rain had mentioned .   
Valefor was out of action , but Mama was in play , Bamet the animal herder was out there , Coronzon the monstrous changer was there , and then there were the Crowley brothers .
As far as I knew , they were the only Fallen left .   
The Mcveay ’s were kaput , the Behemoth - worshipers with the strong religious bent had n’t survived the apocalypse .
The Crowley brothers were n’t really water manipulators , by and large .   
They and their immediate family members tended to riff on the duplication theme , often duplicating things that were n’t themselves .
I ’d really wanted to knock out at least most of the leadership before moving on to the next phase .   
Taking out all of the major leaders would have worked too .
“
I recognize you , ” Rachel said , interrupting my thoughts .
“
What ? ”
Imp asked .
She was talking to Chris .
“
You know him ?
” I asked .
“
What ? ”
Chris asked .   
“
No she does n’t .
”
“ I know of him , ” Rachel said .
“
No she does n’t , ” Chris said .
“
What ?
”
Imp asked , again .   
“
Wait , the changer thing-
this kid is the fucked up bird thing we saw and the crawly skull thing we heard about ?   
And the tentacle thing from the video Tats showed us ?
”
“ Video ?
” Chris asked .
“
Is he ?
”
Rachel asked .   
“
Oh , okay .
”
“
What ?   
How is that okay ?
”
Imp was incredulous .   
“
You ca n’t just raise a topic like that and say
oh okay .
”
“
Whatever .   
It ’s not important , ” Rachel said .
“ You have me on video ?
”
Chris asked , sounding as alarmed as I ’d ever heard him .
“
No big deal , ” Rachel said .   
“
Not important .
”
“
It ’s important to me !   
I do n’t like people recording me without my permission .   
I get enough of that with the one teammate .
”
“
Fuck me , ” I said , under my breath .   
Louder
, I said , “ Guys .
”
“
You know him ?
”
Rachel shrugged .   
She laid a hand on her dog
’s neck , and the dog jumped .   
She sounded like she was trying to be soothing as she told Imp , “
Forget I said anything .   
And you ’re being annoying again .
”
“ Guys . ”
“
Rachel , you know I love you in the most hetero of ways , but telling people to calm down never works
and it ’s not working here .
”
“ I told you to stop being annoying , not to calm down .
”
“
It ’s the same thing , with me .   
I get stressed , this is how I deal .   
And I get stressed when you say you know him-
”
“ She does n’t , by the way , ” Chris said .   
“ Needs to be said again .
”
“ -I have a right to be irritated when you do n’t finish the thought .
”
“
Thought ’s finished .   
I recognize him .   
Thought started and ended .
”
“
How ?   
Who ?   
When ?   
Where ?   
When ?   
Who ?   
Explain .
”
“
Too much hassle now that you ’re being annoying , ” Rachel said .   
“
I ’m fine leaving it be .
”
“ I can and will do horrible things to you without you knowing , ” Imp growled .
“
I ’m fine leaving
it be too ,
” Chris said .
“
Good for you two , but I ’m not fine ! ”
Imp retorted .
I pushed out with my aura , getting their attention .
“ We have a job , ” I said .
“
Good , ” Rachel said .   
Imp , meanwhile , only huffed .
We backtracked to rejoin the others .   
Chris stuck by me , adjusting his clothes so that the garment he wore in monster form cloaked him like a poncho , the folds covering his lower face .   
He wore the headphones , but he did n’t have the braces on .
“
You ’re okay ?
” I asked .   
“
Not seeing things ?
”
“
I ’m seeing lots of things .   
I need distractions .
”
“
There are others who are comatose right now because she got to them .
”
“
Emotion powers do n’t affect you as much , right ?
” Chris asked .
“
Yeah .
”
“ Monsters do n’t get to me .
”
I thought about responding , but we were back where the others had gathered .
Sveta was with Weld , Narwhal had most of her team , Foil was with Parian , and Vista was sticking close to her team with Capricorn sitting next to her .   
She was saying something in Tristan ’s ear , while he held the earplug just slightly out of his ear , ready to put it back in at a moment ’s notice .
I needed to say something to her .
Rain was just far enough ahead of the others that I thought he was n’t part of the greater group .   
He was with the stragglers in Narwhal ’s team , Fluke included , and they were coming back from a brief excursion , carrying some of the injured they ’d collected .   
The biker girl with the broken ribs was one .
“
Can you hear ?
”
Rain asked .
“
Yes , ” I said .
“
We grabbed these guys because we need to see if we can shake them free of the effect .   
I wrote up more on my phone , to catch you up .
”
“ Snag did a number on you .
”
He nodded .   
“
But I want to help .   
Take my phone .   
It ’s a resource .
” I nodded .   
I took the phone , then gestured to the others .   
“
Come .   
I want to discuss this .
”
When I approached Narwhal , Vista and Weld , it was with Sveta , Rain and Chris at my back .   
Capricorn was already hanging out with Vista , so he had to take only a few steps to join us and be part of our group again .
We were missing two members .   
We ’d soon have another backing us , if Narwhal was game .
“
I ’m thinking phase two , ” I said .
“ If we ca n’t crack this army of theirs and knock out their leadership , do you really think we can contain it ?
”
Weld asked .
“ I think we have to change venues , ” I said .   
“
We leave .   
We make this a siege .
”
“
That ’s phase two ?   
No , ” Rain said .   
“
They still have hostages , and they have the food to drag this out .   
Hostages .
”
“
We ’re hurting the hostages by being here , ” Narwhal said .   
“
The Fallen and their allies are being subjected to mental torture the moment they fail expectations .
”
“ We can back off , and you can fill us in so we ’re armed with knowledge , ” I said .   
“
The closer we get to them the more we get caught up in their rhythm , so I want to pull back .
”
“
You ’re sure about this ?
” Sveta asked .
“ I think so , ” I said .   
“
I do n’t see a clear other way .   
We ’re pinned down , and that ’s even with us having heavy hitters .   
We ca n’t get close if seeing or hearing one person can destroy us .   
The big issue is that they ’re united in their horribleness , and we ’re … all on different pages .
”
Rain hissed , “ If I can contribute anything at all , let it be me telling you that you ca n’t let these guys have a chance to regroup .
”
“ Multiple buildings are damaged , Prancer ’s group set fire to a number of them .   
They ’re in disarray , ” Narwhal said .
“ They revel in disarray , ” Rain said .   
“ W-
they were the fastest growing settlement to start from scratch .   
They ’re good at kicking ass when they have nothing going for them .
”
“ I know you ’re concerned about the hostages , ” I said .
“ Victoria , ” Capricorn said .
I moved my hand .   
The same gesture he ’d given me , before .   
Flat , angled so it was n’t quite a ‘ stop’ gesture , not facing the grass and mud beneath us either .
“
Fuck , ” Capricorn said .   
“ Rain , I get what you ’re saying , but you left .   
You ’re out of the loop .   
We really discussed this and planned this , and we took it to the heroes .
”
“
Not that it worked out great so far , ” Chris said .
“
Do n’t snark ,
” Sveta said , quiet .
“
We ’ve been accommodating of your situation , ” I said .
“
You ’re playing that card ?
”
Rain asked .
“
We ’ve been accommodating , ”
I said , again , reinforcing it .   
“
We ’re here , and a big part of the reason we ’re here is because you wanted this .
”
“ I wanted to save good people in a bad situation .
”
“
Accommodate us , ” I said .   
“ Please .
”
I saw him make a fist .
“ Please , ” I said .
It took him a moment , but he relented .
“ I ’ll talk to Advance Guard , ” Narwhal said .   
By her resigned tone , I could tell she did n’t want to pull out .
I nodded .
“
We ’re with Prancer , you know , ” Foil said , behind us .
“ I know , ” I said , turning around .
“ If you go , we ’re staying .   
We ’ll do what we can here .
”
“ We ’ll have to dodge March if she ’s still around , ” Parian said , quiet .
“
Yeah , ” Foil said .
“
This is n’t a good day .
”
“ Be safe , ” I said .
“
That ’s the plan , ” Foil said .
Narwhal called out the order .   
Rachel called out another .   
Her dogs were guarding the perimeter , and they drew closer .   
Some capes took up the job of watching for trouble .
I grabbed Rain by the wrist , as we walked away .
With Mama Mathers infecting us , there was a limit to what I could do .   
As it was , I dragged my finger along his wrist , and I spelled out words .   
They were n’t very clear words , only ‘ ERIN’ and ‘ NO- ‘ .   
I did n’t get to write the ‘ W’ , because he pulled his hand away .   
He stared at me through the lens of his mask .
I heard him sigh .
I made sure the others were secure and Narwhal ’s team was ready to go , and then I flew skyward , until I was high enough up to be safe .   
I made a call .
“ Looksee , ” I said .
“
Oh my gosh , you have to fill me in on everything .
”
“ Soon , ” I said .   
“
Can you do me a favor , though ?
”
“
Yes , ” Kenzie said , with no hesitation .   
No qualifiers , either .
“
Tell me how things have gone on your end , first .   
Distract me .
”
Sure enough , I could trust Kenzie to talk nonstop at the slightest provocation , and I could use that in the moment .
I asked because I needed a bit of cover to give me time to type a message that was easily in my top three messages I never thought I ’d write , while not looking at the screen .
Shh .
Find Tattle .
Coordinate with us & undersiders .








No plan survived contact with the enemy , but I hoped it would at least be recognizable in the aftermath .
Phase two .   
Contain and besiege .
We staggered our retreat , with Capricorn walling off the path behind us before the group moved again .   
The Fallen sent some people our way , but I had the impression the people were scouts , figuring out where we were and then getting scared off by the razor - forcefields and antisonic booms .
Rain stuck with Narwhal ’s group , and even contributed some of the suppressive fire .   
As I flew around the treetops to keep an eye on things from above , I saw the occasional tree topple , as Rain ’s power and something else hit a tree around the same time .
Trees falling was good .   
It helped to cover our retreat in the same way Capricorn ’s walls did .
He kept giving me looks .   
I could n’t read his expression while his mask was on , but I could make assumptions .   
He had n’t liked leaving , or even pretending to leave , and I knew he wanted to help Erin .
Mama Mathers was powerful .   
It was n’t that she had the clout some other top tier capes did , but her existence created a blind spot where we could n’t keep tabs on the Fallen ’s side .
Another wall snapped into existence .   
Fluke gave the call to move on , and the group ventured further into the woods , away from the area where the Fallen camp was nestled .   
Narwhal ’s offensive team followed behind the retreat , with Fluke staying back to report to her as she caught up with him .   
Weld was hurrying forward to stay near the front of the group , taking on a semi - leadership role .
With each phase in our retreat , Capricorn ’s walls went up faster and bigger .   
Vista was sticking by him , and from what little I could see as I used my advantage of mobility to check on everything , they were getting along great .
Yeah .   
I needed to have a chat with her .
Sveta was sticking with Weld , even though they had different focuses in the moment .   
Weld was directing people and making sure the coast was clear , while Sveta had Weld ’s phone in hand , a brick of a thing with push buttons that she needed two hands to hold .   
He would have dialed for her , or answered for her while Looksee called .   
Our kid tinker was on the other end .
My phone was in my pocket , the cord of my earphones running up beneath my armor and hair to my ear , where it was covered .   
I was looped into the conversation .
With the rain pattering down around us , cool but not cold , my setup meant I could keep my hands and face dry , without risking that my phone might get wet .
“ I had my moment of heroism , I even caught some bad guys , ” Looksee said .   
“
It ’s probably kind of lame compared to what you guys are doing , but it ’s my first win ! ”
“
Your first win , ” Sveta said .
“
Mine and mine alone , yes !   
I was keeping an eye on everything around the camp and the moment things started , a bunch of people in the town got in cars and raced off in your direction .   
I told my friends here and they told Narwhal and her group , but nobody was in a good spot .   
So I programmed like lightning , and repurposed the projector box .
”
“ Not too many details , ” I jumped in , wincing at the offhand mention of the trap .   
“ We do n’t know who ’s listening in .
”
“ Sorry .    
But I put up projections of police officers and vans and some heroes .
”
“
What I ’m
hearing in this is that you ’ve taken the time to capture and keep images of police officers , vans , and some heroes , ” Chris said .
He was in on the call too , apparently .   
I had n’t known before he spoke up .
“
I did n’t keep anyone ’s faces or anything , and I changed up the hero costumes , ”
she defended herself .   
“
I even asked most of them if I could take their picture .
”
“ Says the girl who could probably make a camera that steals literal souls if she tried .   
Totally innocent thing to ask , and they have no idea at all .
”
“
Could not .   
Souls are for God to handle , numbnuts .
”
“
Be nice , both of you , ” I said .   
“ Tell your story , Looksee .
”
Capricorn was jogging along , with Vista at his side .   
He produced orange sparks , and she distorted the space around them .   
He shook his head , and the sparks winked out .
It was really , really weird to look at the pair and realize they were about the same age .   
I ’d heard about Vista from Gallant before I ever even met her , and I ’d tried my best to take her as a fellow hero first and a kid second , at his suggestion .   
But she was seventeen , now .   
Crazy .
“ I finished picking out the code and put up my projections just before they came around the corner .   
They rolled up and stopped because they had a bunch of guns pointed at them .   
I called the guy Victoria mentioned-
”
“ Gilpatrick , ” I said .
“
Yes !   
I feel bad for forgetting his name .   
He ’s nice .   
I really like him .
”
“ You like everyone , ” Chris said .
“
He ’s likable , ” I said .   
“ One of my favorite people .
”
I heard an audible increase in excitement when Looksee responded , simply from the fact I ’d validated her impression .   
“
I see why .   
They sent a van super quick and took all the people into custody .   
Fallen , hanging back in the town .
”
“ They would have been the ones keeping an eye on things , ” Sveta said .
“ Reinforcements , ” Looksee said .   
“ They had guns .   
The assholes .
”
It was Chris who answered that .   
“
We know about the guns .   
The Fallen and Hollow Point guys have been shooting them all over the place .   
Victoria got shot .
”
“
What ! ?
”
“
I ’m fine .   
Already patched up , ” I said , as I thought ,    I might need physiotherapy , and there ’s a sensation in the center of this mess that makes it feel like the bullet is still in there , but I wo n’t die .
“ I got shot too , ” Chris said .   
“
Not that anyone cares .
”
“
When ? ”
Sveta asked .
“ I was Dark Introspection .   
It did n’t do much of anything , but I still got shot .
”
“ Do n’t talk like that , you guys , ” I heard Looksee .   
“
I ’m
teary eyed even thinking of you guys being seriously hurt .
”
Okay , we needed a distraction .   
“ Looksee .   
I ’m thinking of a plan , beyond what we already talked about .   
You ’re a key part of it .
”
“
What we just talked about , with our reinforcements ?
”
“
Yes , ” I said .   
Our reinforcements .   
Good to phrase it that way .   
Tattletale .
“
I ’m looking into it , ” Looksee said .
“
Good , ” I said .   
“
This is separate .   
If you ’re up for it .
”
“ Reinforcements ?
” Sveta asked .
“ Rain or I can fill you in after , ” I said .
She did n’t respond immediately .   
Down on the ground , I saw her look up at me , her Brute - and - gauntlet - wearer class phone still held to her ear .
“
Okay , ” Sveta said .
“ Looksee , ” I said , hurrying to lay it out now that I ’d cleared some of the obstacles and interpersonal issues .   
“ You may have people coming down the road .   
It ’s the easiest way for them to get out if they want to make a run for it .
”
“ I ’ll be ready .   
With reinforcements , maybe .   
Depends .   
They ’re not answering .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .   
“
How hard would it be to set something else up ?   
Gilpatrick is wrangling an awful lot of people .   
What if those people were waiting elsewhere ?
”
“
Elsewhere ? ”
Looksee asked .
“ Or … in as many places as you can manage .   
I ’m thinking we put the evacuees in one place , or spread them out .   
They ’re people the Fallen have some reason to care about .   
We put images of the evacuees in other places , or we fill out the groups .   
We give them a reason not to shoot the moment they come storming down that dirt road or out of the woods .
”
“ I ’d need to grab images and write some code .   
I ’d have to change the spectrum angle on the- thing .   
There ’s a lot of stuff .
”
“
Can you ?
” I asked .
“ I can try , but it ’s going to be hard , and I ’ll be distracted .   
I might have to hang up
so I can focus .   
Um .   
Is there anything else I need to do or plan for ?
”
“
No , ” I said .
“
I ’m going to hang up then !   
Will call back soo-
”
she announced , hanging up before she ’d even finished the sentence .
There was a pause .
“
Is the world ending again , or did she really just say that ?
” Chris asked .   
“
She decided of her own volition to hang up on friends .
”
“
She ’s excited to help , ” Sveta said .
She was , I suspected , but I was n’t sure I ’d heard excitement , exactly .
Hard to pin down .
Capricorn was building the next wall within Vista ’s distortion .   
He turned blue , and the wall turned to water .   
There were shouts as people near the wall had to jump back to avoid getting sloshed .   
Some could n’t avoid it and were soaked or partially soaked .
Narwhal raised her voice .   
I double checked what I could see of the woods , to make sure nobody was coming or passing by our flanks , then dropped from my lookout position .
I hung up my phone as I descended .
“ -of
you showing off ?
”
Narwhal asked .   
I ’d missed the start of the sentence .
“
No , ” Capricorn said .   
He was back to being Tristan , and he was drawing out the wall even as Narwhal grilled him .
“
This is a serious mission .   
Your team posed it as such , and you were there-
you saw how high the stakes are .
”
“
Absolutely , ” Capricorn said .
“
Yes ma’am , ” Vista said .
“
What were you doing ?
” Narwhal asked .
“ Trying something , ” Capricorn said .   
“ Vista saved me time earlier , I thought we could afford to lose some to try this , because it could save us a lot of time .
”
“
Capricorn , I get the impression you ’re a good cape , the walls are good , you ’ve kept a level head .   
But the people back
there-
they ’re the ones who ca n’t afford for us to screw up or let the Fallen catch up with us .
”
Rain was standing a bit off to the side .   
He ’d been with Narwhal before , and he ’d approached , because Capricorn was his friend .   
He looked at me as Narwhal said the last bit .
Soon , I pledged mentally , without saying it out loud .
“
Yes ma’am , ” Capricorn said .
“
What were you trying to do , powerwise ?
” I asked .
“
Seeing what translates when I change out , if there ’s a way to have her help make it bigger , not just move the sparks around faster , and keep it big even after she withdraws her space warping .
”
“ You were trying other stuff before , ” I said .
“
Yeah .   
Flubbed this one , I think something went wrong .   
The plan was to swap out , swap back a second later , so the wall mostly held … one second .
”
He turned blue .   
Byron .
“ Did n’t go according to plan , ” I concluded .
“
There was a resistance to swapping back , ” Byron said .   
“ Had to push in a way I never have .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .
Back to Tristan .
“ Scary , ” Tristan noted .   
I was already listening for the sound difference between the pair of them , so I was n’t relying on sight alone , and I did n’t miss that he ’d said the word in a voice that did n’t sound like either of them .   
Or maybe it was the voice that fell in the venn - diagram overlap of how they were the same , in the middle of their case - seventy situation .
Narwhal gave me a long look .   
As if I was some kind of judge or voice for the weirdness of the team .
“
It ’s a tricky power , ” I tried answering the look .   
“
If they did figure out a way to save time and let them put up taller , thicker walls , I think you and I would be complimenting them on their ingenuity .   
This did n’t cost us much .
”
Narwhal looked over in the direction of the biker and Fallen we ’d collected .   
Afflicted by Mama , they were dealing with the worst she could deal with .
“
We ’re backing off anyway , and they are n’t pressing hard .   
We ’ll figure out another angle , ” I added , sounding as confident as I could .   
It felt strange to try to convince someone of Narwhal
’s stature .   
“
Maybe figure out how to help them .
”
“
We can try some things once we get far enough out , and that ’s why I ’m mindful of wasted time , ” Narwhal said .   
“ I miss having thinkers , but we could n’t conscience bringing them with us , with the risk .   
They could crack this and help those people .   
It ’s frustrating .
”
“ It is , ” I said .   
I glanced at Rain .
And there ’s Tattletale , ignoring Kenzie ’s calls , doing something out there , I thought .   
I do n’t know if she could crack this , but she does n’t seem too interested in trying .
Narwhal turned to the Capricorn - Vista pair .
“
Right now we need steady and reliable , with no surprises .   
Please , ” Narwhal said , with emphasis on the please .   
“
And no more small talk .   
Let ’s stay focused on the mission .   
I overheard when I caught up to you two .   
We should save the … complex    inter - cape interactions for later .
”
Oh , so she ’d noticed too .
“
Got it , ma’am , ” Capricorn said .
Vista did n’t voice her response , and from the way she held herself , I wondered if it was because she did n’t feel comfortable speaking in the moment .   
She only nodded .
“ Vista , ” Narwhal said .   
“
Can you cover our flank ?
”
“
Narwhal , ma’am ,
” Capricorn said .   
“
She does help me put them up faster and better .   
I ’d like her to keep helping .   
You do n’t need to separate us .   
We ’ll stick to what we know works , and we work well together .
”
“ Vista , ” Narwhal spoke in a lower voice , not taking her eyes off of Capricorn .   
“
From what I know of your power , you do n’t need to be close to make it work .
”
“ No ma’am , but I have to put it between the trees and it helps if I ’m not too far away , so I can see instead of only feeling .
”
“
I ’ve been aligning the walls to work with her on that , ” Capricorn said .
“
No small talk , ” Narwhal said .   
“
You can stand further back and keep an eye on more of our flank while you work , Vista .
”
“
Yes ma’am , ” Vista said .
Fluke grabbed Narwhal
’s attention , and she reached up and over for a forcefield that appeared over her hand , gliding over to him .
“
That sucked , ” Capricorn said .   
He was working on the wall again .   
“
I generally pride myself on being a kickass , professional cape , and I just got told off by someone global in stature .
”
“
I ’m on the exact same page as you , Cap , ” Vista said .   
“
Except I was a Ward , not a shill , and that ’s my actual boss .
”
Capricorn did n’t give a visible reaction to being called a shill .   
Something they ’d talked about earlier ?   
A joke ?
“ I think she ’s nervous , ”
I said .   
“
This whole thing is worse than we thought it would be , and we thought it would be awful .
”
“
She ’s very nervous , ” Vista said .   
“
We ’re all nervous .   
So much going on at the borders between worlds
and we find out there ’s something this rotten this close to home ?   
Things are supposed to be getting better and these guys seem really fucking committed to taking things in the other direction .
”
“
She ’s looking , ” Capricorn said , as he turned his head toward his wall .   
“
And we ’re still talking .
” “ Vista , can we talk ?
” I asked .
She followed me off to the side .
“
I ’m going to be cringing about this for the next five years , ” Vista said .   
“
I goofed and got distracted , and everything went splat in front of my team leader , my team , my old team leader , you ,   Capricorn …
and I think my boss knew why .
” I had been able to tell what was going on when I was a hundred feet in the air .
“ First off , ” I started .
“
Yes ?
”
“
The bad moments ?   
Never as bad as they are in your own head .   
You could n’t predict that .   
Take it from the bystander and friend , do n’t cringe for five years .
”
She did n’t respond immediately , but then she nodded , sighing as she did it , like she was letting something free .
“
Okay ?
”
“
Okay .   
What ’s second off ?
”
“
Second … do you want it blunt or do you want it gentle ?
”
“ Blunt , ” Vista said .   
“
I ’m a fighter .   
I can take it .
”
“ You have a problem , ” I told her , quiet .   
“
You have a thing for unattainable guys in heavy armor .
”
I saw her react , like she ’d been punched in the gut , before she steeled herself .   
I could even work out the thought process , as she noted that others were in a position to see us and her .   
She could n’t react too visibly .
“
Dead son of a cunt , I might actually , ” she said , under her breath .   
“ Unattainable
why ?
”
“ Ca n’t say .   
He ’ll tell you soon , I think .   
He thinks you ’re cool .
”
“ They always do , ” she said .   
“ When things are calmer , you need to help me with this .
”
“ I can try , but before we talk about that- ”
“ We should talk about it another day .
”
“
Okay .   
But on this , just to clear things up in a way I can explain , he has a twin brother .   
The one in blue- ” “
Oh .   
That ’s what that was .
”
“
It ’s not a secret , but it ’s not something we tell the bad guys either .
”
“
Got it .
”
“ I wo n’t say go for it , because … messy .
”
“
We ’re all messy .
”
“
Messy … in a way beyond the cape usual .   
I do n’t think they can date , as it is .   
And a very different personality .   
Brace yourself for that .
”
“ Okay .
”
“ I think he could use a friend , but again , being blunt-
”
I stopped as my phone rang , the earphone still in my ear , cord hidden by hair and armor .   
I held up a finger for Vista .
“
Yes ?
” I asked .
“
It ’s Looksee .   
So I ’ve got a thing .
”
“ Talk , ” Sveta said , on the other line .
“
I ’m getting footage of the Fallen evacuees , two cameras out there , one up close to get the people and one pulled back to track light sources and get another angle .   
My pulled - back is freaking out .
”
“
Freaking how ? ” Sveta asked .
“ Literal ghost in the machine freaking ?
” I asked .
“
Yes !   
Yes , exactly .   
I ’ve never heard that term before but it fits exactly .
”
“ How has a tinker never heard-
” Chris started .
“
Do n’t look at it , do n’t dig into the code , ” I talked over him .
“ Was n’t .
”
“
It ’s Mama Mathers , ”
I said , loud enough for others to hear .   
“ With Gilpatrick ’s patrol squad .
”
“
She was approaching , not with them yet , I think , ” Looksee said .
“ Looksee , call Gilpatrick !
” I warned .   
“
I ’m on my way .
”
“
I ’m coming , ” Sveta said .
I thought of the secret message to Kenzie .   
The plan .   
I ’d pledged something to Rain , too .   
“
Has Mama affected you at all ?
”
“
Barely .   
Ears .
”
“ Rain , how hurt are you ?
”
I moved the hand of my uninjured arm at my side , where only he was really in a position to see .   
A slash , side to side .
“ Really hurt .   
Snag did a number on me , ” he said .
With luck , he was lying , and he got my intent .   
We needed him as the one person who Mama could n’t control , operating in a place she could n’t see- away from those she ’d infected .
“ Situate yourself , cover us to our south , ” I said .   
Again , I made the slash .   
“ Be ready to join whoever , but stay put .   
Sveta , escort him , then come to us ?
”
“
Okay , ” Sveta said , looking at Rain .   
“ Can do .
”
“ Rain ?   
Fill her in on anything you can on the way .
”
“
Understood , ” Rain said , with a slight emphasis .   
Rain jogged northward .
“ C and I will follow , or we ’ll hold down the fort .   
I ’ll call when we can confirm , ” Capricorn said .
“
I ’m pretty mama’ed up , ” Chris said .   
“
I ’m dealing
but it ’s distracting .
”
“
Distracting ?
”
Capricorn asked .   
He sounded slightly incredulous .
“
Seeing the surface of everything peeling away to show the shrieking flesh beneath distracts me .   
Sue me .
”
Capricorn turned his head .   
“ Narwhal ’s fighting .   
I think the Fallen coordinated things so they ’d hit all sides at once .
”
“
She can do that , ” I said .   
“
Seeing what she sees .
”
“ You realize you ’re going alone ?   
Until Sveta catches up with you .
”
“ I realize , ” I said , raising myself up off the ground a bit .
I flew , zig - zagging to avoid the worst of the branches , ducking my head and letting smaller ones graze my hood .
I had a view of the broader landscape , and I could see where the roads formed an almost hammer - and - sickle image , the half - circle of road with forest cupped in it , and
the line stabbing through the southeast or east , leading to the Fallen camp .   
Gilpatrick ’s group was to the northeast .
The wind blew at my hair and pulled my hood back as I flew .   
Something I ’d need to fix .   
My arm throbbed with renewed pain , not because I ’d moved it , but because I ’d changed the angle of my body and that changed how the blood flowed through me .
“
Are you with us , Looksee ?
” I asked .
“ I am .   
I called Gilpatrick , told him .   
You sound windy .
”
I sounded windy because I was flying .   
Looksee , though- she sounded quiet , and not nearly as talkative as before .
“
Are you okay ?   
No effect through your tinkering ?
”
“
No effect , ” she said .
I was especially aware of the fact that she had n’t verified
she was okay , and she did n’t sound okay .
“
What ’s wrong ?
” I asked .   
“ Cut the others out of the call if you need to . ”
“ Already did .   
Victoria- Damsel is with Gilpatrick .   
She ’s sitting in the back of a van .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“
What did I miss ?   
Do n’t leave me out .
”
“
I ’m not ,
” I said .   
“
I have n’t talked with the others about it , they saw , but I do n’t think Rain knows yet .   
We ’re digesting .
”
“
Digesting what ? ”
“
She snapped , Looksee .   
Not quite like we ’ve seen before .   
I think-
she went there because she needed a time out .   
I do n’t know what ’s going to happen .
”
“
Okay , ” she said .
I could see Gilpatrick ’s trucks .   
I could imagine where we ’d last seen Mama , and where she might have gone .   
I averted my eyes from the part of the forest where Mama might be .
“
Did someone die ?
”
Looksee asked .
“
Someone died , ” I said .
“
She looks like someone died , ” she said .
“
I ’m at Gilpatrick , ”
I said .   
“ I ’ve got to focus .   
Step back .   
Get away , phone her , or-
”
“ I want to help .
”
“
Then work on projections , or try again with our ‘ reinforcements’ .   
Throw yourself into this if the distraction helps .   
Just do n’t look at Mama on camera , do n’t dig into code
she ’s affected , and listen to the little voice inside you if it has doubts about doing something .
”
“ I ’ve got your back , ” she said .
Below me , a few people fired into the trees .   
There was no returning salvo .
I dropped out of the sky , landing more softly than I usually did , on account of my arm .
No Mama .   
The Fallen were remaining in the trees .
“ Victoria , ” Gilpatrick said .   
“ Thank you for the warning .
”
“
No trouble ?
”
“ We had a sudden influx of evacuees .   
No guns , no problems .   
We cut it off , told them to stay back .
”
“
And ? ”
“
And if Looksee is right , I think your problem cape thought she ’d conceal herself among hostages and catch us by surprise .
”
“ If you hear or see her , she can affect you , ” I said .
“ Great , ” Gilpatrick said .   
“ Master - stranger !   
Noise protection , eyes down !   
Yellow for open fire , you better remember the rest !
”
People scrambled to listen .
“
Hey !
” came a male voice from the woods .
“ How fast does it take effect ?
” Gilpatrick asked .
“ Fast , but limited exposure is n’t too bad .   
Hallucinations , auditory and visual .
”
“ I risk exposure , to know what ’s going on ?
” I nodded once .   
“
I do n’t see a better way .   
Unless you want me to deal with it alone .
”
“
No . ”
Gilpatrick looked like an entirely different man , with the tension in his face and neck .   
He ’d ceased being the tough - but - fair teacher and had become the soldier who had fought real - as - shit monsters .
He held his gun in one hand and a small remote in the other .   
The active squad members who were n’t managing the Fallen that had already evacuated were standing with ear protection on , caps pulled down with brim blocking some of their fields of view , their heads bent so they stared at the ground a few feet in front of them , instead of looking forward .
Some of them looked pretty fucking scared .
In the background , I saw Ashley emerge from the back of one of the trucks parked on the road .   
Not repainted schoolbuses , but a heavy metal van that might have transported money once .   
She walked around to the side and leaned against it , one hand over the wound on her arm .
I nodded once .   
She nodded back .
Well , some sort of backup , in the event of a dire situation .
And the guy in the woods was still making noise .   
“
Hey ! ” “
What ! ?
”
Gilpatrick called out .
“ Do n’t shoot !
” the guy said .   
“ I ’m unarmed , she wants to talk .   
I ’m talking for her .
”
Gilpatrick looked at me .   
I was n’t sure what response to give .   
I knew this might be safe in the technical sense , with emphasis on might .   
This guy could have powers and he could have powers from the same branch of the family , but odds were that he was unpowered and unarmed as he said .
“
She might want to talk , but she ’s going to use the chance to threaten to do something horrible to hostages , ”
I said .   
“
And she ’ll do those horrible things .
”
“
Better to open dialogue , ” Gilpatrick said .
I nodded .
“ You and you alone , come out !
”
Gilpatrick called out .
The Fallen was a skinny shirtless guy with a beard , tattoos up his neck and tattoos on the whites of his eyeballs .   
He stood at the edge of the woods .   
We stood on the road , a ditch with tall grass just in front of us , a hundred feet of uneven ground with rocks and weeds spanning the space between the ditch and the guy .   
Gilpatrick ’s group had made a makeshift bridge with two stretchers side by side , for the evacuees to cross the ditch .
The bearded man paused .   
“
She says her son needs medical attention .
”
“
We can negotiate , ” I said .
“
She says you need to think about the long term .   
You might not like her , but you want her in power .
”
“ I somehow doubt that , ” I said .
“ The Crowleys ca n’t and wo n’t accept peace .   
The guns were theirs .   
She only wants to be left alone with her congregation , ” the man said .   
“ They are attacking Advance Guard right this moment .   
If you stop her and you do n’t stop them or wipe us out completely , they will gather up the remaining Fallen and go to war .
”
“
The hallucinations stop now , and they stay stopped , ” I said .   
“
We ’ll take Valefor to a hospital .
”
“
She says he ’s your leverage then .   
To keep the hallucinations gone .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
I glanced at Gilpatrick , and he nodded once .
“
She says she expected to see Rain here .
”
“
Let ’s stay focused on one topic at a time , ” I said .   
“ You want Valefor to get help .
”
“
Same topic , she says .   
We were talking about leverage .
”
Erin stepped out of the woods .   
She moved slowly , and she stopped , standing just behind and to the right of the man with the beard .   
Her expression was drawn .   
She met my eyes , and I saw the recognition .
I saw her look at Ashley .
“ Give us Rain , and we ’ll give you her , ” the man said .   
“ Tell Rain , and he ’ll agree to it .
”
The trading of hostages , less valuable for the more valuable , maybe .
Rain had powers , so he counted as valuable , and he was immune to her powers , so he was a threat .   
Hopefully he was a threat who was operating in the background now .
Yeah , I was n’t about to tell Rain .
The man continued , passing on
Mama ’s words , “ Prancer
’s group is done .   
They ’re a non - threat now .   
They ’ll leave with their tails between their legs if we let them , and we ’re not ready to let them .   
Agree to leave us be , and we ’ll call back the Crowleys .
”
“
And you keep your ‘ congregation’ , ” I said .
“ Even if you killed the leaders of each family , the congregation would remain , ” the bearded man said .   
There was a feral look in his eyes .   
“
We ’re here to stay , unless you ’re willing to kill us to the last man , woman , and child .   
Learn to deal with us .   
Negotiate .   
Do you want peace , or do you hate us so much
you ’d prefer a mindless war ?
”
“
It ’s not my place to make deals of that scale , ” I said .   
“
I ’d have to pass it up to the people at the top .
”
“
There ’s nobody at the top except God , ” the bearded man pronounced .   
I wondered if he was a preacher , with that passion .   
He was a   little less enthused as he went on to say , “
No government , no law , no kings or queens .   
You can decide what happens to Rain and Erin here , you can decide the little things , and we ’ll all keep your secret .   
That will be the shape of our negotiations today .
”
“
Hi , Erin , ” I said .
“
Hi .
”
“
You okay ?
”
“
Not very .
” I nodded .
“ Time matters , ‘ hero’ , ” the bearded man said .
“ Back off , ” I said .   
“
We need to talk a minute .
”
“
Your loss .   
The Crowleys are winning .   
Our offer stands .
” I looked at Gilpatrick , and at the row of his soldiers that were ready to shoot .   
Erin was among the targets , and there were presumably others in the trees behind .   
Indiscriminate fire would be disastrous .
I looked back at Ashley , who leaned against the van , almost crushing her forearm in her grip , the grip was so tight .
“
You ’re right , ” Gilpatrick said .   
“
This is n’t our call to make .
”
“ They are n’t about to wait and let us call up Chevalier and wait for him to finish whatever he ’s got scheduled today , and they are n’t going to let us try to track down someone in government who might have the clout to
okay this .
”
“
No , ” Gilpatrick said .
I wondered if this was even something we could possibly do .   
To compromise with a group that was uncompromising and unwilling to change its mind at its core .
“ Tick tock , ” the bearded man said .   
Using tactics to make us feel rushed to make a decision .   
My mom had employed that on me , once , as something illustrative .   
I ’d been too young to appreciate the lesson , at the time .   
I ’d mostly been pissed off .
“
There ’s no clock , ” I said .   
“ Advance Guard can hold their own .   
They ’re good .
”
Stupid on a macro scale , but I ’d liked how they functioned in a scrap .   
I could trust that .   
I would n’t get pulled into their tempo .
“ They ’re outnumbered .
”
“
They ’re good enough that does n’t bother me , ” I said .
“ Tick tock , ” the man said , again .   
It irritated , which might have been the point , but it irritated me because it was so stupid and unintuitive .
“ Valefor has to be dying , with that wound .   
If anyone ’s feeling the clock , it ’s you guys , ” I said .   
“
No mother wants their child to die .
”
“
She says lots of mothers do , but they keep it to themselves , ” the bearded man said .   
“
We have time on our side in more than one way .   
He ’s dying slowly , she says .   
Slowly .
”
Slowly .   
The Speedrunners .
They were operating in the background and every time they intervened , they made this whole situation vastly more difficult .
The old side of myself wanted to kick their asses .
“ Tick tock , last chance , ” the man said .
Last chance ?   
What was I missing ?   
My eyes scanned the surroundings .
“
And it ’s done , ” the bearded man said .   
He turned to walk back into the woods .   
Erin looked bewildered , but he motioned for her to stay .
“ Stay put !
”
Gilpatrick called out .
The bearded man froze in his tracks , his back to us .
“
I ’m
okay with dying , motherfuckers ”
the bearded man said , but he stayed put .   
“
She ’s telling me that one of our powered just got your Rain
… and
Rain was n’t where you told him to be .   
He was coming up on us from behind .   
Secondhand caught him and now your girl in the armor is cornered .   
Four against her .
”
I drew in a breath .
“
Erin here has outlived her usefulness .
”
Erin bolted and I flew .   
Nothing to lose .   
I flew to where Erin had been , and raised my forcefield .   
I felt it drop as a bullet hit it , and dropped to the ground .
It was because I was at a weird angle and because my peripheral vision was untouched that I saw it .   
Two streaks from above , straight down .
I heard the metal crash , and saw circuitry and metal housing scatter .
The gunman behind Erin had lost his rifle and he held his hand in an awkward way as he used the other one to reach down for the rifle .   
Gilpatrick shot him before he could claim his weapon .
The metal- pieces from Looksee ’s camera .
One dropped from the sky to hit the gunman ’s hand .   
The other- Children and other unarmed individuals emerged from the trees .   
A wall of bodies .   
the woman behind them was supported by two Fallen .
The woman was bloody , a scrape down one edge of her forehead and a messy patch of skin and blood toward the top end , hair already matted into it .   
Blood streamed down her face .
The blood meant I had n’t immediately recognized it as Mama Mathers .   
The moment meant I had n’t even realized the hallucinations had stopped .
Kenzie had dropped one of her flying cameras on her .
And the Fallen – there had been a good number in the woods .   
Possibly the bulk of Mama Mathers’ faction .
They were charging forth , a wall of hostages goaded to stay in front of them , and they brimmed with all the fury and menace of the legions of hell .
Gilpatrick used the remote to flash .   
Two red flashes , bright enough that the people looking down at the ground would see the color change .   
I knew the code from my training with the patrol block .








With the rain we ’d had , there was a degree of slipperiness to the dirt and grass .   
Twenty five , maybe thirty people were coming at us-
it was hard to count when the allegiance of some of the hostages was so unclear , and some had guns .   
All had a loose arrangement of hostages in front of them .   
Some of the hostages slipped as they ran , and they were trampled by those behind .
Gilpatrick gave me a worried look over his shoulder .   
He was using the remote- three green flashes .   
I was left to back up , letting Erin go ahead of me .   
I crouched by the front tire of one bus .   
Erin climbed up onto the bar at the side , so her feet would n’t be sticking out below the bottom of the painted bus .
The color coding of Fallen came to mind-
two were in white , with Mama Mathers being one , held up by two people at the treeline .   
Another wore white and hung even further back , peering through the woods while wearing a pale leather animal mask .
There were two options there , if I went by what Rain had told me , and both were messy .   
Animal Master , likely , and the Changer geyser .
One in black- a Fallen that was holding Mama Mathers up .   
From the way they were handling her , she was still alive .   
They were trying to take her to safety .
One pointed at me , lifting his gun as he turned to his buddy , who had slipped in mud and fallen a few paces behind .   
I pulled my head back behind cover .
People opened fire , but they were our people .   
Gilpatrick stood on the wheel of a bus , and fired over the hood .   
I peeked at the result with my defenses up-
the Fallen who was n’t in black that was supporting
Mama Mathers had created a wall of white - blue material with faces embossed on it .   
The material cracked as the bullets hit it , and the cracks closed up almost as fast as they appeared .
I ’d peeked too long , and one shot me .   
It pinged off of the Wretch , and I ducked back behind the front of the bus , where the wheel at least partially protected me .
I knew the Mathers were notorious for their involvement in kidnappings and their connections to other families .   
It was what defined them as a sect of the Fallen .   
Now I was seeing the long term results of that kind of operation .   
Rain had already spelled some of it out .
Mama Mathers was a nightmare to deal with , and she ’d traded for multiple capes who could protect her .   
Layers of defenses , and Looksee had slipped past those layers to take her out of action .
Rain dripped off of the front of my hood as I hunched over .   
My arm was limp at my side , and it hurt all the more because of my position .   
Even crouching , somehow , made my arm hurt more , because the angle was different , or because the blood flow had changed .
“ Captain Gilpatrick !
”
I heard the voice .
Ashley .
“
What is it ?
”
Gilpatrick replied .   
He had his back to a truck much like I did .   
Many of his students were crouched in the ditch , the road , another ditch , and a bit of mud and grass between them and the Fallen .
“
I want your-
”
A series of gunshots from a handful of the oldest patrol block members interrupted her .
“
-your permission to fight !
” she finished .
He hunched over , back to the wheel rim , reloading .   
He called back , “ I ’m not going to do that !
”
“
It ’s not easy for me to ask !   
I ’m trying to respect- ”
He looked at me , not her , and interrupted , “ You do n’t need my permission to fight !
”
I did n’t hear the start of her sentence , as someone else on our side fired a gun .   
A Fallen returned fire and shot the bus .
“ -want
it , ” she said .
“
Too bad !
”
he called out .   
“
You choose , I ’ll be a witness and I ’ll testify how you handled it , good or bad !
”
I looked across the far ditch , furthest from the Fallen , and saw where a stone had been rolled away to make way for the dirt road .   
It was large enough a tractor or team of horses would have been involved .
They ’d be close in a matter of seconds .   
I put one hand out , pressing it against the stone , and brought out the Wretch .   
I pulled back , and the Wretch held on .   
Together , we heaved the stone free from the earth that surrounded it .
“
Do n’t fuck me , ”
I whispered to the Wretch .   
I could hear the fingers and teeth biting into the stone , arms wrapping around it and squeezing until it threatened to break .
Two hundred and fifty , three hundred pounds of rock .   
The dirt road was constructed so it formed a hump , with vehicles traveling along the raised portion , with rainwater flowing into the ditches on either side , to be reabsorbed or to run off into some larger water source .   
It was the cover the patrol block people were using , and it was cover I could use , albeit in a different way .
I left the scene , flying low and hauling the rock with me .   
The Wretch continued to wrestle with it , mindless , carving into it .   
I worried it would break in half .
Once I was far enough away
I could n’t see the people , I flew over the road , and flew at them from the sides .
Fights were about information first , positioning second , action third .   
It was why I studied parahumans , and it was why I favored the faux thinker - one power I had in my bird
’s eye view , when I could use it without being shot .
Without information , people could n’t know where they needed to be .   
If they were n’t in the right place at the right time , they could n’t act .   
Positioning was second .
I was fast , silent , and approaching from an unexpected angle .   
I looked for where the people with guns were , and I released the stone .   
It hit the ground with no sound but an impact that saw them react .   
I pushed out with my aura for good measure .
With momentum , it rolled a short distance .   
It rolled into the group , and four people toppled , a stone that came up to almost hip height hitting their legs with crushing force .
If I was a police officer , I would have been clear to shoot , faced with people that had rifles and handguns .   
I considered myself clear to demolish anyone who was armed .   
The Warrior Monk would have been fine with it .
I saw one person who had a gun I could make out , a rifle painted a dark green with a coarse , grippy texture .   
The Wretch and I relieved him of the burden of having to carry a rifle and having unbroken hands .
I knew I was risking getting shot by the first person with the presence of mind to point a handgun at me in an casual way , instead of drawing the thing and sticking their arm out .   
Risky too , to fight when I did n’t have the use of my left arm , and a good hit to my arm when I was defenseless could bring me to my knees with the pain .
The aura helped make people stupid , and I could use positioning in another way , moving fluidly and unpredictably as I ducked and darted between people .
I was n’t about to back off when they were this close to Gilpatrick , potentially Jasper , and others I ’d worked with .   
Even the pissy anti - cape types deserved to come out of this
okay .
Handgun ?   
I brought the Wretch out and slapped at arm or weapon .   
Knife ?   
I did the same .   
Bat ?   
Easy to hit the weapon and send it back toward the wielder ’s face .
A few braver members of their group pressed in , trying to dogpile me , grabbing instead of punching or swinging .   
Harder to deal with , until I brought the Wretch out a bit longer .   
I could see them react as it unfolded , like an irregularly shaped bubble around me .
I withdrew the Wretch before it could get a grip on anyone or anything .
One pointed a gun at me , and I flew past the gun to drive my forehead into his face .   
Instinct , not pre - planning , but I was thinking the Warrior Monk would forgive me on that .   
My arm hurt , inexplicably , from me delivering a hit with my head , and my forehead hurt .   
I was n’t wearing my mask-
it still dangled from my waist , the curve allowing it to rest against my thigh .
I did n’t let it show .   
I watched the others back off , the recent damage and the aura being ample reason .   
One had four bloody marks swelling on his chest , and I realized I ’d been too slow to dismiss the Wretch , or it had been too quick to unfold .   
She had managed to stab her fingertips into flesh .
Hate .   
The feeling hit me so suddenly and so unexpectedly that I thought it might have been one of Rain ’s cluster - mates .   
Hate like when I had been in middle school , arguing with a classmate who had spewed out insane , vile rhetoric that would have made them a perfect fit for Empire Eighty - Eight or the Fallen , and he had refused to listen because I was a ‘ pretty , privileged white girl’ and that had somehow meant my experiences and opinions were n’t valid , even though he was an okay looking , privileged white boy .   
I ’d hated him
and I ’d hated that I could n’t talk or shout sense to him and make him stop or even pause in being such a shitty person .
Hate like I had channeled at my sister , because she had broken something intrinsic in me .   
Because she had torn open emotional doors I had really wanted to protect and be tender with , so soon after I had lost Dean .   
She had violated that and staked her claim to what lay beyond those doors , and it was only by twisting devoted , passionate love into devoted , passionate hate that I had briefly been able to retain something of myself and my boundaries .   
Only briefly .
I hated the Wretch , in that same way .   
I hated the blood spots I could see where fingers had dug in , the guy now on his knees , fingers at his chest with blood seeping between them .   
I hated the scratches on Moose ’s face .
I hated the ones with broken hands , arms , and legs , the ones who were lying on the ground screaming .   
I hated that when I ’d had the ability to be gentle , I had n’t been , and now that I wanted to be gentle , I could n’t .
To top it off , I hated the Fallen .
“
Stand the fuck down !
” I shouted .   
“
Or I wo n’t hold back anymore !
”
Rain fell all around us .   
In the ditches by the road , the water made small trickling sounds .   
I could hear gunfire in the distance , and I could hear the patrol block .
My aura burned dark and intense , and I knew that they would n’t be feeling the pause or the odd mid - fight peace of rain and the ongoing violence being more distant .
One of them looked at the hostages , who ’d made it to the dirt road and now crouched there .   
I flew straight for them , pushing past the people in the way with enough force to knock them over .
My thought , my instinct , was that if they had a gun , I wanted to already be there , ready to stop them .   
They did n’t have a gun , so I went easy .   
I kicked them across the lower legs , the Wretch momentarily active .
“ Stand down and do n’t even fucking look at them , ” I said , pointing at the people they ’d used as human shields .   
“
And do n’t fucking think of raising a weapon .   
I will shatter you , and you can see how well they take care of you here , or you can go to the hospital , get fixed up , and they ’ll send you back home .
” I paused .   
I stared at them , meeting each one ’s eye in turn .   
Roughly half their number were on the ground .
“
Do you really think the Fallen are going to look after you when the weather gets colder , food is short , and you ca n’t be a farmer or a soldier ?
”
I saw movement .   
A blur .   
I moved away , ready to raise the Wretch , and as much as I could raise my defenses as fast as I could put my thoughts together , the attacker was fast and I had n’t anticipated being blindsided .
The hit was hard , and the only reasons it was n’t harder were that it hit my armor , at least partially , and I was moving back and away .
I winced , my hip aching .   
Maybe it was telling , that I ’d been driven to get back and away before I ’d thought to make myself impervious .
Mama Mathers had kept bodyguards close , but she either had reinforcements from the other family , or this mob had more powered Fallen in it .
It was a Fallen woman .   
She was younger than me , going by stature and frame .   
A Leviathan theme to her mask , but with a fin on top and at the sides .
She came at me again , and this time I had the Wretch up .   
She hit it hard , winced , and turned pitch black , freezing in space .
She got me from behind , a cord encircling my neck , pulling tight .   
With my breastplate set up the way it was , there was a little flare of spikes , a few inches in front of my chin , pointing slightly outward .   
The cord or wire caught on that , and
I brought my good hand up , gripping the wire .
I pulled to get free , and I met resistance- at the same moment
the obsidian black figure in front of me resumed motion .   
She hit the ground with one foot , and launched herself at me .
I activated the Wretch and tore through cord , catching on something solid enough that the Wretch flickered out .
Metal wire , it seemed .   
A garotte , no association with my friend and teammate .   
In the course of moving away from the attacker , I moved closer to the unfrozen woman , and put her off her rhythm .   
She changed , freezing in place , and the attacker I had n’t yet seen attacked me from behind , hit me sufficiently hard to make me crash into the frozen woman .   
The hit was enough that I ’d bruise , but the residual impact made my gunshot wound explode with pain .
I twisted around , exerting force against the immobile obsidian statue , and she came to life , stumbling back , just as I saw the attacker behind me freeze .
One attacker , with two bodies .   
Whatever one was n’t active was immobile and apparently invincible .   
Whichever one was active had enhanced speed and the strength that came with hitting things very fast .
The scholar in me wondered for a moment about just why so many Fallen were such massive pains in the ass , with such a solid crop of powers .
Conflict drive ?   
Close associations with other powers ?   
Careful selection and sharing of powers through breeding , insofar as powers were inherited that way ?
Wretch out , I punched one woman- hit statue .   
I pulled the same arm back , elbowing the one behind me- only for her to become statue just in time .   
The one in front was already moving out of the way of any follow - up attack , the Wretch grazing her , making her stumble a little .   
She still moved too fast for me to give chase .
She attacked relentlessly , and with a speed sufficient that the Wretch only blocked one in three hits .   
I could use some basic fighting sense or flying away to protect myself against another one in three , but it still left a gap .   
One or two hits made me stumble .   
Another cracked me hard enough across the side of my head that I momentarily could n’t make sense of what I could see .
I connected one hit , then followed up with a swing , Wretch active , hitting the ground hard enough to send a spray of stones , dirt clumps and mud at her .   
She went statue and attacked me from behind with her other self , but when I retaliated , the original self had to shake off the residual mud .
I heard Ashley use her power .
She sailed over the heads of Fallen , landing with a bit of a skid .   
Her hair was wet and slicked back , and her eyes were wide with the extent of their whites showing .   
No pupils .
I was n’t sure what to say , so I stated the obvious .   
“ You came .
”
“ R needs help .
” He did .   
That he ’d run into trouble had been the window Mama Mathers had needed .   
I would have helped him already , but I could hardly leave my patrol block .
Sveta had been with him , too .
The lizard - demon Fallen came after me .   
I fended her off , flying a bit away to position myself closer to Ashley .
“ Is it alive ?
”
I asked the Fallen .   
“
Your other self .
”
The lizard - demon Fallen charged after me again , in lieu of answer .   
I lashed out , and she became statue .   
It was like hitting something Clockblocker - affected , from my hometown
’s old Wards team .   
No result , nothing got through .
“
I ’m giving you one chance to-
”
Ashley ’s power misfired .   
She stumbled .
The lizard Fallen went after her .   
Another cord .   
Harder to get it around Ashley ’s neck , when Ashley was bent
double- Ashley brought her injured hand up , and the wire pulled against her forearm , cutting into flesh .   
Blood welled out .
Power welled out too .   
The power flared , and the cord broke .   
The Fallen stumbled back , and became statue as Ashley turned to look at it .
“ If you ’re a pair and not one cape with a gimmick , you ’ll both want to stand down , because my friend hits pretty darn hard .
”
“ I do , ” Ashley said .   
Long , wet white hair had fallen across her face while she was bent over .   
It stuck there .
The lizard Fallen cackled , but did n’t respond .
She went after Ashley , instead of me .   
Two of her at once , but never acting at the same time .   
One became a statue the moment Ashley looked like she might have her bearings and be able to respond .   
I flew over , and the Fallen girl moved around behind Ashley , shoving her in my direction , maneuvering to never give either of us a clear shot or angle .
She hit Ashley in the midsection , and Ashley reached out , putting a hand on the Fallen
’s collarbone to steady herself .   
She was hit from behind , one hit to the kidney .
She used her power , and it tore through the statue , ripping it apart .   
Ashley was thrust away by the blast , and she landed not very far from where the lizard Fallen had dropped to the mud and grass , sitting there in shock .
Ashley had n’t been lying when she ’d suggested her power could hurt me .
It had been the final test , in a way .   
The group of Fallen soldiers were hanging back , the patrol block having emerged , guns held up .   
One or two in the Fallen still had guns as well , or had picked them up , but they were badly outnumbered .
Had the lizard Fallen won , I wondered if they would have pressed the attack , even faced with equal numbers and more guns .   
I wondered if they would have had a choice .
Choice .   
I looked for the instigator and leader .   
Mama Mathers had disappeared into the trees , along with the Fallen in black , the one who had conjured the blue - white wall of faces , and the beast - masked Fallen in white .
Gilpatrick ’s group began to disarm , arrest and manage the Fallen soldiers , some tending to the wounded , others hanging back and keeping their guns raised .
“ R is in trouble ?
”
“ I overheard , ” Erin said .   
“ One of Bamet ’s animals came to relay information .   
R was attacked .
”
“ Rain , ” another of the human body shields said .
“
I was leaving the full name out , dad .
”
“
Do n’t betray your own , Erin , ” the man said .
“
Our so - called own betrayed us !
” Erin shouted .   
“
Fuck !   
They never cared .   
We were only tools to use .   
Shields to get in the way so they could get up close .
”
“
No , ” I heard his response .   
I cut him off before he said anything else .   
There were other priorities .
“ Attacked where ?   
How ?
”
“ I- I do n’t know .   
I ’m sorry , ” she said .   
And in that instant , she did n’t sound like the confident girl I ’d talked to .   
She was shaken .   
“
It- bad .   
Bamet ’s animals , they barely speak English .   
But his situation is bad .
” I frowned .
“ If you find them , do n’t kill the animals ?
” Erin asked .
“
The animals ?
”
“
There ’s something human in there .
” I frowned .   
I had to go .
“
You good ?
”
I asked Gilpatrick .
“
Yes , ” he said .   
“
An awful lot of wounded , but- we ’ll manage .
”
I looked at Ashley .
“
I ’ll stay , ” she said .   
“
Call if you need me ,
but- ”
But she ’d turned herself in ?
Did she cut herself off because she could n’t bring herself to say it ?
“
I ’ll protect these people if they need it , ” she said , instead .
So many people did n’t look like the ones I ’d known .   
Erin and Ashley both lacked the confidence they should have had .   
Gilpatrick looked more like the grizzled soldier than the teacher .   
Even the Fallen-
well , they ’d been threats and now the most aggressive and armed of them were on the ground , defenseless , making noises of pain .
I did n’t look like the me I wanted to be , probably .   
So soon after donning my new , pretty costume .
This other me took to the air , flying against the falling rain , so that the gentle patter became something sharp in the brief ascent .
Rain , Mama Mathers , and the remaining leadership figures of the Crowley and Mathers branches .
Roughly in that order , anyway , as far as priorities went .
I could see Capricorn ’s work , and he had raised walls in a way that left the Fallen with far less in the way of places to go .   
Some reached as high as the treetops , most others were shorter , speedbumps and momentary obstacles , such that going around was probably easier than finding a way through or over .
I reached for my phone and dialed .
“ -n’t
find him , ”
Capricorn ’s voice came through .   
There was a whoosh of air on his side of the conversation , stopping as he finished talking .
“ I ca n’t do much , ” Looksee said .   
“ Victoria ’s on the line now .   
She was fighting .   
Are you okay , Victoria ?
”
“ Fallen to the Northeast were arrested .   
One powered among them .   
Erin ’s okay .
”
“ Rain will be so happy to hear that if we can actually find him , ” Capricorn said .   
Still with the whoosh .
“ Mama Mathers got away .   
But she ’s out of action , ” I said .
“
She ’s alive ?
”
Looksee asked .
“
Last I saw , ” I said .
“
Okay , ” Looksee said .   
She sounded funny .   
“ Damsel ?
”
“
She ’s staying behind .   
Protecting them , she said .   
But she wants to stay in custody , I think .   
I think it ’s a good idea .
”
“ Okay , ” Looksee said , barely audible .
“
It makes sense , ” Capricorn said .   
I heard Vista ’s voice , and still with the whoosh .
“
Are you flying ?
” I asked .
“
We caught a ride , ” Capricorn said .   
“ Traveling Narwhal style .   
We ’ll be coming around your way soon .
”
Narwhal style ?
“
Okay , ” I said .   
“ Sveta , Chris ?
”
“
Gone , same as Rain , ” Looksee said .   
“ And changing .   
He thinks Keen Vigilance might be able to hear something .
”
“ Traveling up the east perimeter , ” Capricorn said .   
“ Vista says she would appreciate a lift down to solid ground .   
She ’s not super confident of her ability to land .
”
“ Land ?   
You ’re actually on a Narwhal forcefield ?
”
“ Doing loops .   
They travel in straight lines , but Vista can bend straight .
”
Okay .   
I was n’t just catching my two friends , then .   
I was doing it while they were surfing on a flying , crystalline cleaver .
Fuck me .
“ I ’ll use my power .   
Tell me when you start to feel it , ”
I said , my attention all over the place , as I looked for any sign of Rain , Sveta , Mama , Capricorn , and Vista .
“ Feeling it , ” Capricorn said .
I spotted them , and flew to match my trajectory to theirs .   
“ Only one working arm .
”
Vista
’s power warped space around us , slowing their speed .   
It took me a second to adjust .   
I let the thing catch up to me , and rested my foot against it , leaning back and moving with it .
“ Catch him , catch me after , ” Vista said , her voice briefly doubled on both phone and in person , slightly out of sync .
I caught Capricorn
’s hand .   
I could n’t use the Wretch , and the strain of my arm carrying him reached across my shoulder to my injured other arm .
“
I ’m
okay
if it ’s rough , ” Capricorn said .
It was rough .   
He landed hard , clipping a branch on the way down .   
He did n’t react or seem to mind , letting go and pointing .
Vista had jumped , and she was descending slower , the space between her and the ground extending .
I flew to intercept .   
I caught her hand in mine .   
Again , my arm complained .
Not as heavy as Capricorn .
“
Thank you , ” she said .
I lowered her to the ground .   
Capricorn put his hand out , catching her by the upper arm and helping with the final couple of feet .
“ Mama knew where Rain was .   
If we track her , we might be able to find him .
”
“
I ca n’t help , ” Looksee said , through the phone .   
“ Both of my active cameras broke .   
I ’ve got another covering myself and Tattletale , I could send that .
”
Vista seemed confused .   
I motioned for her to come closer , fished in between my armor and my top for my other earphone , rubbed it against the edge of my hood , and offered it to her .
“
It would take time to get here , ” Capricorn said .   
“
Do n’t worry about it .
”
“
Should n’t I very worry about it ?
”
Looksee asked .   
“
I should send them now in case they ’re needed .
”
“ Cameras broke ?
”
a voice came through the phone , hissing .
“
Yes , ” Looksee said .   
“
Do n’t get on my case about it , vigilant dumbnuts ,
I ’m not in the mood .
”
“
Wondering … how ? ”
“ I dropped one on Mama Mathers and I dropped another on someone with a gun .
”
“
It worked , ” I said .   
“
I do n’t know how you aimed that without looking through the camera-
”
“ I did n’t .   
My cameras were already fritzing out , so I sent them a slice of program , with facial recognition .   
I centered it over them , accounted for wind , and when things sounded worst I had my cameras stop hovering .
”
“
You weaponized … cameras ?
”
“ I told you not to get on my case about it , ” Looksee said .
“ Am not .
”
“
I did n’t weaponize the cameras , just so you know .   
I ’ve said I ’m not good at making my cameras function like weapons .
”
“ I remember , ” Chris’ snakelike voice came through the phone .
“
I weaponized the off switch , obviously .
”
“ Obviously , ” Capricorn said .   
“ Send your camera .   
If Mama Mathers is out- ” “ Pretty sure she is , ” I said .
“ We can use all the help we can get .
”
“ It ’s not like Tattletale is responding , ” Looksee said .
“ Victoria , can you give us another set of eyes from above ?
” Capricorn asked .
I nodded , taking back my earphone from Vista .
“
I really hope he ’s okay
, ” I heard Capricorn , the tail end of the sentence almost inaudible as I was already flying .
The weather seemed to be easing up .   
I noticed the precipitation was n’t as sharp as I flew up into it .   
Not like it had been minutes ago .
Capricorn ’s walls to the southern end of the camp had served to funnel the Fallen in other directions .   
The road seemed untouched , the settlement was almost half and half for buildings that had been abandoned and leveled , and the fighting seemed concentrated at the north end , Crowleys and Advance Guard , and where I ’d been helping the patrol block to the northeast .
The northeast was a starting point .   
I imagined they would want to go to where there was help .   
That meant they ’d either head for the center , through open space where I would have to be able to see them , or they ’d cut north .   
The latter would let them move through the trees .
I reported it to the others .
I spotted the first of the animals .   
A man with a hunched back and the head of a pig , his body heavy with muscle that did n’t match an ordinary person ’s .   
There was a horse , too , but its normal long face had been replaced with a human ’s , folding around at the sides in a way that distorted the mouth and made the eyes bug out .   
Mama Mathers was draped over the back of the horse .
My pulse pounded as I approached .   
I turned sideways to appear less threatening and held my good hand up for the animals , trying to get them to ease up .   
My only experience with horses had been at Dean ’s family ’s place .
The pigman made noises , and I winced .   
It sounds like a stuck pig .   
An animal in pain .
I ’d wondered how the barnyard cape had blended in with the Fallen aesthetic .   
I was n’t wondering anymore .
“ Is she alive ?
” I asked .
“
Uuuuuhrh , ” the horse moaned , in a halfway sound between a moan and a whinny .
I held my hands up , easing them as I drew nearer .   
I hesitated , then put a hand at her neck .   
I felt for a pulse , felt one , and then pried open one of her eyes .   
I watched it dilate in the light .
I did n’t consider the administration of first aid or medical know - how a strength of mine .   
I ’d taken a class in first aid , and I ’d learned it , a long time ago , and I ’d refreshed myself when I had joined the patrol , but … Suffice to say , that base had been covered , for most of my hero career .
The animals reacted , heads turning .   
I glanced back .   
the others had arrived .   
Capricorn , Vista , and Chris as a broad mountain of hair and layered plates with massive ears and huge eyes , a foot taller than Capricorn .
“ Mierda , ” Capricorn said .
“ Erin said there ’s something human in there , ”
I said , staring at the animals .
Chris started to approach .   
The animals shied back .
He sighed .
“ We ’ll help if we can , ” I told the animals .   
“
But can you show us the way to the others ?
”
“ You do n’t want to do that ,
” yet another strange voice came through the phone .
“
I ’ve been trying to get in touch , Tattletale , ” Looksee said .   
“
You ’ve been ignoring my calls .
”
“
The fact you ’re saying we do n’t want to do this is a pretty good motivator to do this .
”
“
Do n’t be a child , Victoria .   
You ’ve got the Mathers leader in your hands .   
Good one .   
Now leave .   
Or go help
Advance Guard , because they really need it .   
Your friend Rain is done for .   
He was always going to be done for .
”
“ Even if I was willing to accept
that- ” “
Which we are n’t , ” Looksee interrupted .
“ Our friend was with him .   
Sveta .
”
“ Garotte , ” Tattletale said .
“ Sveta , ” I said , more firmly .
Capricorn and Vista were lowering Mama Mathers to the ground .   
The ‘ animals’ seemed more relieved than anything to have that taken care of .   
The existence of human mannerisms and expressions on animals was disconcerting .
Capricorn began creating a cage for her , to encase her body .
He apparently deemed it better to contain her and risk that she would n’t be okay than to rush to give her medical care and risk other lives .   
We ’d already tried the more merciful route .
“
Okay , ” Tattletale said .   
“
I do n’t think it matters at this stage .   
You do n’t need Bamet ’s beasts .   
I ’ll tell you where you need to go , if you promise not to stir up shit with Cradle and his friend .
”
I glanced at Capricorn , then back at Chris .
“
Promise , ” I said .
“
That ’s a lie .   
Whatever .   
I ’d remind you this is me being nice again , but you do n’t care .   
There ’s a barn southwest of you .   
You overshot when you approached .
” I looked .   
A barn , in the middle of pen fields , with some stone - and - mortar fences separating fields from road , so no car would drive off the road and into the field without meeting an obstacle first .
The rain was only a trickle now .
Vista warped the space , to bring everyone closer .   
It only served to make my trip there even faster , as I flew .
The first thing I noticed was the blood and the bodies .   
Animals had been slaughtered , and their parts made for a macabre , eerie picture , with human and animal mixed and blended .   
The two Fallen bodyguards were dead , and there were a few others , besides .
The second thing I noticed was Cradle in the rafters .   
His robot was large enough that its hands could touch multiple walls , grip the rafters and touch the ground at the same time .   
Cradle was perched on the back of one hand , crouching as he stared down .   
Another parahuman , dressed in black with a red handprint on his mask , was gripping one finger , dangling .   
He had a cleaver in his hand .
And in the corner , almost impossible to see , Sveta was huddled .   
Her body was damaged , and tendrils snaked out , gripping herself , none long enough or positioned well enough to do more than snake around her shoulder and chest , twisting at cloth to reveal the painted shell beneath .   
She was glaring , hate , and in the moment she looked at me , the hate broke , and she looked like she might cry in relief , or in grief .
She held what remained of Rain in her arms , as he gasped out short breaths , like a fish out of water .   
The damage done-
it had n’t been her .
“
Let ’s not make this a thing , ” Cradle said .








The weather had relaxed some , but the barn we were in had a corrugated metal roof , and each drop that hit it snapped against the hard , hollow surface .   
The sound was like dull static , punctuated by Rain ’s gasps .
Nobody around .   
Most of the fighting had moved to the fringes and perimeters .   
Whether it was upside or downside to our secret plan to get behind the fighting and hit them somewhere vital , I could n’t be sure .
Had to admit , after seeing Rain , I really would have liked to hit something .   
It might have been nice to have some regular bad guys around .   
Something told me Cradle was n’t about to let himself get smacked around .
He was smiling slightly .   
Asshole .
I kept an eye on Cradle and his assistant as I got closer to Sveta .   
She adjusted as she could to put Rain closer to me and further from the crack in her shell where the tendrils were licking out .
I knew the rule that the badly wounded were n’t supposed to be moved , less because of any medical knowledge I ’d picked up , and more because I ’d seen an awful lot of people with injuries over the year .
Rain ?   
The rule should have applied .   
It was the kind of badly hurt that made me worry that any further tampering would break him .
He had a cut on his face that parted his mask and the bridge of his nose , extended through his upper lip , through the lower lip , and down to his chin .   
His mouth was open as wide as it could go , bloodstained teeth showing , and the cut on his chin was open wider than his mouth .   
There was n’t darkness beyond that wound-
it was the opposite , with the white of bone showing .
Sveta cradled his head with one hand and arm , even after moving him some , and her hand pressed against the chin , blood getting into the gaps of the prosthetic , the fingers doing very little to hold the wound closed or staunch the bleeding .
I knelt at her side , felt Rain jerk his head as I moved her fingers .   
I pushed the wound closed , then moved her fingers with my hands , positioning them , holding them firm .   
I took my fingers away , and it was sticky enough
I felt her fingers move as mine did .   
They did n’t move so much that the wound opened again .   
Better .
There was another cut at his eyes- eyelid , bridge of the nose again , and the orb of the other eye .   
Shallower , but the damage to the eye made for a lot of fluid .   
His good eye was closed , a mixture of blood diluted in damp settled into the creases and cracks .   
He pried it open , jaw chattering a bit with the effort , and stared at me with one eye that was shot through with blood , but not bloodshot .
More moisture .
“
Come on , ” I said .   
“
Hang in there .
”
“ We should go , ”
I heard the man with the red handprint on his mask say .
“ If you try to walk away from this , we ’re going to have a problem , ” I said .
“ Do n’t be unreasonable , ” Cradle said .
“ Thinker , ” Sveta whispered .   
“ Combat focused .   
Cradle hit me with something I could n’t see .   
It might have been a laser not visible to the naked eye .
” I nodded , trying to divide my attention between the villains and Rain .
What was I even supposed to do ?   
In any other situation , I would have picked up Rain and flown him to the nearest hospital .   
The reason I was n’t was that I was genuinely worried that a firm shake would make what little blood he had in him fall out .
A mercy , maybe , that Capricorn , Vista , and Chris all turned up .   
Less a mercy that they had to see .
“
What did you do ?
” Capricorn asked .
“
And they all turn up , ” Cradle said .   
“
You swapped one member out .
”
“
Oh no , ” Vista said , as she moved close enough to see Rain .   
She hurried to my side .
“
There ’s no point , ” Cradle said .
I was undoing my belt , a faux - gold band that I ’d used to add some color
so my costume was n’t too top - heavy .   
The process was hard , complicated by the fact that my left arm had a hole in it and my hand was n’t cooperating as a consequence .
I needed to refresh myself on things-
I ’d learned about tourniquets from the patrol block , but in the moment it felt like half of what I ’d learned was that tourniquets were a complicated , complicated thing .   
Compartment syndrome , damage from long - term use .
“
You bastard , ” Capricorn said .
“
I ’m not the bastard here ,
” Cradle said .   
“
He is .   
Everyone we ’ve told the story to has agreed it ’s fair .   
When the bad guy is shitty enough , it stops being revenge and starts being justice .
”
“
That ’s not right at all , ” Sveta said .
Cradle sighed .
“ Does ‘ everyone’ include Tattletale ?
” I asked .
“ I do n’t see how that matters , ” Cradle said .   
“
This is done .   
He ’s done .   
Things have come full circle , telling you would only …
”
His machine ’s hands moved .   
Everyone , myself included , tensed .
One hand moved , palm upward , elbow pointed down .   
A one - armed shrug .
“ …
Multiply the grudge , ” Cradle finished his sentence .
Rain ’s hand and one arm were my focus here , as I grit my teeth and tried not to be distracted .   
He was cut up pretty badly- defensive wounds , with the degree of damage hard to discern .   
The way cloth draped and the hand - coverings he wore obscured things .   
Like his teeth , the blood ran between the decorative elements of his glove .
His other hand had cuts , ones I might have called serious , if not for the fact that I was having to look at things in totality .   
If Crystal had cut her hand like that on an ordinary day , in some hypothetical universe where she tried and failed to use a real knife , I would be rushing her to the hospital .   
As it was ?   
Low priority .
There were cuts on his chest-
I ’d look at those after .   
Vista was tending to his leg , which was as bad as the arm .
“
Multiply the grudge ?
”
Capricorn asked .   
He stood between us and Cradle .
“
You ’d walk away wanting to kill against me and against any co - conspirators I named .   
You go after me , after them , and assuming they have friends and contacts , assuming you succeeded , those contacts would go after you .   
Each time , it becomes something bigger , until one side gets wiped out .   
Let ’s end it here .
”
“
What do you think is going to happen , Cradle ?
” Capricorn asked .   
He was incredulous as he asked , “
You really think I ’m going to walk away when you ’ve done this to my friend ?
”
“ What I want to happen , is for Operator Red and I to walk away .   
You walk away , and leave the Fallen asshole here .   
Your friend killed my friend and clustermate , the scales are even , we can resent each other and still never see each other again .
”
Capricorn barked out a laugh .
“
I hate that kind of life - death calculus , ” Sveta murmured .   
Not loud enough to be heard by Cradle .   
Her focus was more on Rain and on herself .   
Her tendrils kept groping at the more ragged edges of her shell , then pulling away , sometimes bending them in or twisting them around .
I focused on Rain ’s more damaged hand and arm as I attached the belt .   
He fought me , struggling as I tightened the belt , which made the pain in my left arm all the worse … but the fight was n’t nearly as intense as I wanted it to be .   
A more intense fight in response to what had to be agonizing pain would mean there was more life in him .
This tourniquet would have to do .   
I was pretty sure I was good to go if the risk from blood loss -real and present - outweighed the damage from amputation .
“ I do n’t think they ’re going to do that , boss .   
They look ticked , ” Operator Red said .   
He was still holding on to one of the Cradle - machine ’s fingers .   
He dropped , and fell about ten feet to land on his feet , legs bent .   
He straightened , and Chris moved forward a step .
Chris looked back with one bulbous , dark eye .   
He had no expression to read .   
There was only armor and coarse hair , and a long snout with eyes set on the side , the head more fishlike in dimension than mammal .   
His eye protruded and narrowed , more conelike than round as it pointed in Rain ’s direction .
“
Let me turn the question back on you , Capricorn , ” Cradle said .   
“
How do you want this to go ?   
A fight ?   
You all fight me and Operator Red , you get your vengeance on behalf of your murderer friend , and this makes it better ?
”
“ Might help , ” Chris hissed the words .   
Broad blades with a swirling damascus - style blend of white bone and steel were emerging from his various armor plates .   
Retractable weaponry , but not in a quick way .
The ‘ Keen’ part of Keen Vigilance .
“ It might , ” Capricorn said .   
“
But if you really think it was justice , how about we … leave ?   
We arrest you , we go talk to authorities , and if you ’re right , if it is justice , you ’ll be free to go .
”
“
Free to go .   
I ’m sure , ”
Cradle ’s voice was quieter , not because he was quieter , but because he ’d shifted position , turning his back to us as he straightened up .   
He turned back to us , and his voice was stronger ,    “ You do n’t see the hypocrisy ?   
How wrong it would be for him to be free while we ’re in custody ?   
He killed people .   
He laughed about it , to my face , to Love Lost ’s , to Snag ’s .
”
“ He turned himself in , ” Capricorn retorted .   
“
He tried .   
At the first opportunity , he left the camp and went to confess .   
He was so twisted up about it
he was n’t coherent .   
They had him talk to people , but he could n’t say much .   
I guess because of Mama Mathers .
”
“
He tell you that too ?   
I was always fifty - fifty on it being a lie , ”
Cradle said .   
his tone was so casual and conversational , even pleased with himself .   
Maybe he was , with Rain bleeding out .
“
It ’s true , ” Sveta said .
I focused on what I could do .   
Cuts marked Rain ’s upper chest , shoulders , and stomach , until there was n’t much of his top that was n’t wet and shiny with blood .   
In one place where the cuts ran in horizontal parallel , the flesh had come away in a ribbon , the ribbon dangling toward the ground .   
I fixed it as best as I could , pressing a hand down on the wound .
It felt futile .
The wounds to his right leg were as bad as the defensive wounds to his hand .   
I could assume they were early wounds , intended to keep him from running .   
Vista was bandaging them with strips of cloth .
There was only so much I could do .   
I could go through two first aid kits and still run out of material to to bandage and tourniquet this .   
I staunched the wounds with my hands , as best as I was able .
“
Capricorn , ” I said .   
He turned his head .   
My voice was tense as I asked , “ Can you use your power ?   
A cast , or something to seal the wounds ?
”
The first orange lights appeared .
Cradle kept talking , like we were n’t trying to save a life .
“
He killed Love
Lost ’s daughter .   
The girl
’s friend died too , and another one is devastated , even after a year .
”
“ He knows !
”
Capricorn said , raising his voice .   
“
He went to the authorities !   
He wants punishment !   
He wanted jail , because it would at least get him away from this , except you all were coming after him , Mama Mathers had him locked down with her power .
”
And because there was n’t necessarily room , I presumed .   
If it was as serious as Cradle was saying , though … “ That way does n’t work , this way does , ”
Cradle said .
“ Tidier .
”
Operator Red clicked his tongue , “ Tidy is high praise .
”
“
Oh , fuck you , ” Capricorn said .
“
This is a fucked up way to go about it , ”
I growled the words , adding my anger to Capricorn ’s .   
“
This is barbaric .
”
Cradle , despite being younger than I was , managed to sound condescending .   
“
The Fallen are barbaric , and your friend was right there with them .   
He locked us in a shopping mall and let us burn .   
Snag lost the last mementos he had of family and the old world .   
Snag was left with nothing , no escape , only his life … and your teammate got around to taking that from him too .
”
“ Move your hands , ” Capricorn said , glancing back at me .
I took my hands away .   
The orange solidified into an encasement around Rain ’s arm and hand .   
I put my hand to the edge , felt the gap- too much space .   
It was n’t a tight enough fit to staunch the blood or keep things contained .   
I looked at Capricorn and shook my head .
“
You suck at first aid , ” Chris hissed .   
He cleaved at his sash , and the contents fell to the ground .   
The containers were like tupperware , but metal , with rubberized lids , apparently color coded .   
I reached for the nearest one .
“
Careful what you touch , ” Chris hissed .   
“ Green lid .   
Open .
”
I grabbed it , prying the lid off .   
It was a tight fit .
Syringes .   
There was colored tape around various syringes , no labels , no words .   
A foam insert had been carved at in a rough way , to give the needles places to fit in .
“
Red band .   
Coagulant .   
Use little .
”
“ What are you doing ?
”
Cradle asked .
“
How little ?
” I asked .
“
Maybe half inch .
”
A half inch as a unit of measurement for a liquid ?
“
It wo n’t save him , ” Chris hissed .   
“ Might help .
”
“ Why do you have this ?
” Sveta asked .
“ One day I change , come apart instead of changing back .
”
I prepared the needle , holding it over Rain ’s heart .
Chris nodded .
“ Stop , ” Cradle said .
“
The man said stop , ” Operator Red said .
“ Did n’t want to use , ” Chris was quiet .   
“
I like him more than most of you .
”
I plunged the syringe in .
“ Operator , ” Cradle said .
“
Yeah , ” Operator Red said .
Operator paced forward .   
Chris put himself in the guy ’s way , the eye I could see opening wide , ears going back .
I pressed the plunger down .   
Half of an inch .   
I pulled it free before anything could happen to make me put in more than was necessary .
“ Combat thinker !
” Sveta called out .
“
Aw fuck , ” Capricorn swore .
“ Cradle has invisible weapons !
” I added .
“
Fuck ! ”
Capricorn said , as orange trails surrounded his hands .   
He gave Cradle a nervous glance .
Cradle , at least for right now , was hanging back , letting his hired assassin do the dirty work .
Operator reached behind his back , drawing another meat cleaver .   
He flicked it around , so it rolled off the back of his hand , and he caught the handle , with the blade beneath his fist .
Capricorn created his weapons .   
Two swords of the stone material .   
He thrust one in Operator ’s direction , and was almost immediately disarmed of it .
He held the other out , to keep Operator more at bay .   
Orange lights danced around us without any seeming rhyme or reason .   
I left Rain behind and took flight , going high above Operator .
“ Put the needle back , ” Chris hissed , more insistent than before .
“
Are you serious ?
”
I asked .
“ I need it , ” he said .   
He put his arm in Operator
’s way .   
The cleaver bit deep into an armor plate .   
Operator ducked low , swinging under Chris’ arm .
A blade at Chris’ elbow extended as he clenched a large , brutish fist , and he drove his elbow back .   
The two cleaver blades caught the elbow - blade , and Operator was pushed back toward the door .
No sign that he ’d lost his balance or been caught off guard in any way .
I reversed course , dropping to the ground .   
I placed the needle in the foam insert , and then started to replace the lid .
“ Victoria !
”
Capricorn called out .
I looked to Operator first- the most immediate threat , and then I heard the crash .   
Metal fingers and hands reaching up to the roof , finding a grip where it had been bolted or hammered to a broader wooden beam , and then crumpling it .
Water poured unevenly throughout the barn as hands that could have wrapped around a small car brought down the roof .   
Beams cracked and split .
I flew for the largest , most pressing part of the roof , and the beam that was attached to it .   
The walls were shuddering in a way that made me think the entire barn could come down .
Cradle had apparently lost patience .
The Wretch and I hit the roof in Cradle ’s machine hand with enough force that it would take a couple of minutes to walk to wherever it landed .
Sveta , Rain and Vista were n’t in the building anymore .   
Sveta had dragged them out through the open door .   
Capricorn and Chris were facing down Operator Red , and Cradle loomed in the hole in the roof he ’d made , looking up at me .
He swiped a hand in my general direction , coming almost ten feet shy of connecting .   
I put the Wretch up anyway .   
I glanced at what was happening below- Vista was distorting space , keeping Operator Red in the building and giving Chris and Capricorn time to escape .   
Chris was delaying his escape .
Something hit me like a truck , knocking the Wretch out and knocking me almost twenty feet through the air , before I could right myself .
Cradle turned , his attention on those on the ground .   
A lot of strength in those mechanical hands .   
There had to be a good fifty feet of armspan when the two longest arms were extended , and he had a lot of arms .   
He hopped over to one of the shorter arms- almost just a wrist that connected to the central hub , and stepped onto the hand , where he crouched with the hand cupped around him .
I flew at him before he could do whatever he planned to do to the others , my aura down .   
A hand came up , intercepting me , and I hit it .   
The building creaked and crumbled as hands twisted and wrenched at wood to maintain his position .   
He turned his attention back to me .
Another swipe of the hands .   
I flew down , away from the direction of the swipe , and again , something collided with me , knocking me downward at an angle this time .
“ Looksee , ” I said , “ Mm ?
” was the response , small and emotional .
She ’d seen Rain .
“
Can your cameras see-
” I flew to evade as the hands moved .   
They were n’t moving my way , but to get him oriented , as he closed on the others .   
I changed course , flying more toward Cradle himself .
Two hands came up , one to either side of Cradle himself , as if they were going to slam together , catching me in the middle .
They did n’t .   
I hit something , a field or barrier between the hands .   
It did n’t hit the Wretch so much as it dashed the Wretch to pieces , with me bouncing fifteen or twenty feet back .   
The hands came after me , and I flew to evade .
“
Can you see what he ’s doing ?
” I asked .
“
I think so , ” Looksee said .   
“ I need the projector disc , and you need to connect it to my camera , it ’s easy to do , and I need to get it ready .
”
Operator Red had exited out the far end of the building , and was circling around .   
I wondered if Capricorn ’s power had given him pause .   
Chris was only just now going out the door that the others had left by .   
He had the cloth bundle with his boxes and things .
A … mess of emergency measures , it looked like , for a boy who thought he might fall apart with any transformation , but who had no choice but to transform .
I had to get past Cradle to get to him , and I had to get to him to get the projector .
Sveta hauled Rain a distance off to one side , his back to her chest as she used herself almost as a sled , for the easier ride .   
She pulled herself to a fence .
I could see Cradle ’s thought process , as he considered going after her , as he turned his mind to the others- to Vista , to Capricorn , and more specifically , to Chris .
The hand came down , a good distance from Chris .   
Chris , a mound of armored , furred flesh , hopped , ducking and rolling , as the entire area around him was demolished .   
Dirt and soil became a cloud of particles and mud , as something smashed into it and sent the destroyed ground up ten feet in the air .
And as it settled , splattering against one outside corner of the barn , and
everything around them , Chris was there , moving slower than an ordinary person might run , with short , heavy running steps .
Vista was using her power to create distance .   
Cradle crossed that distance by leaping , each hand pushing against ground or the edge of the barn , with one hand up and outstretched , ready to come down on top of them .
I flew after him , and it was easier to close the distance when Vista was using her power .
I reached him just as he ’d almost reached them .   
Then his hand came down early , touched ground , and his entire form rotated , a second hand grazing the ground , turning the landing into a cartwheel , one of the longer arms coming around my way .
Whatever he hit me with caught me and knocked me down into muddy field .   
The landing reawakened the pain in my arm , to the point where I felt the sensation swell , my body telling me that passing out was a possibility .
Not a possibility , body .
Chris having run off to one side and Cradle being fixated on Capricorn and Vista meant I could reach Chris .   
I flew to him , landing .
“ You can see what he ’s doing ?
” I asked .
He gave me a single nod , and his eyes opened wide , ears twitching .
“
Of course , ” I said .   
“ Projector disc ?
”
He tapped the sash he ’d made with the cloth bundle .   
The disc was a belt buckle , as large as a dinner plate , as thick as a textbook .
“ Looksee wants it , ” I said .
Operator Red was on the approach , jogging our way with cleavers in hand .   
Cradle- fixated on the others .   
Vista was trying to keep both opponents at bay by increasing the distance between them and everyone else .
Chris managed to get the disc free .   
He passed it to me , then turned toward Operator Red .
The thing with Vista ’s distance power was that the closer two people were to one another , the harder it was for her to utilize the distance that remained .
“ Keep backing up , ” I said .
I flew straight up .
“ We have a teammate who needs help , ” Looksee said , in my ear .
“ I know , ” I said .   
Sveta still had Rain .   
He was n’t moving much .   
She could have left with him , but I was n’t sure that kind of movement was any good for him .   
“
But if I leave with him , I ’m not sure I wo n’t come back to more of the same .
”
It was already so dark out .   
The clouds were heavier , even though there was barely any precipitation anymore .   
In the gloom , Capricorn ’s lights and the glowing points at the joints and knuckles of Cradle ’s robot were eerily bright .
Equally as bright , Looksee ’s camera flew to me .   
Football sized , with a round lens on the front .
“
How do I do this ?
”
“
Attach it on front .   
Press it on , rotate .   
Like a smoke detector .
”
I was n’t sure I ’d used a smoke detector with that setup , but I could guess how it was intended to go .
The entire thing thrummed as the connection was made , the small , quarter - sized lens in the middle of the projector disc illuminating .
“
Not much battery , ” Looksee said .   
“
You can let it go .   
There ’s going to be a time delay .   
It ’s not accurate .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .   
I dropped it .   
It fell a short distance before taking flight on its own .
“ Help- help everyone .
”
“
I ’ll try , ” I said .
“ I wish I could do more , ” Looksee said .
So did I. I flew after Cradle .
I could see it now .   
Cords or cables , normally transparent , were illuminated in red light .   
There was lag , the light tracing one cord that extended from each fingertip , snapping to another position when it fell out of sync .
“
Annoying , ” Cradle said .   
“ Does n’t change anything .
”
He raised a hand , bringing it down from overhead , in Capricorn ’s direction .
I flew in , and I used the wretch to hit and deflect .
Again , that unreasonably intense force , exploding out and away , as the impact hit the Wretch and the aftershock cascaded out to thrust me away in the air .
The attack was off course- not so much it could n’t have hit Capricorn , but he ’d seen me coming and had moved away .
Vista was a short distance off , using her power .   
They ’d decided being split up was better , and I knew her power was best when she was alone .
She was n’t using her ability on Cradle ’s robot .   
Was it immune ?
He kept going after them , trusting his robot to deal with me .   
I did n’t have a lot of tools .   
Some ideas , now that I thought about it , but … I ’d try for the most basic , tried , and true option .
“ Cradle !
”
I called out .
He glanced back at me , but he continued to ignore me .
I grit my teeth , scowling briefly , and flew in .   
His hand came out , and the red lights showed me the rough path of the cables .   
They moved like a flail would , delayed , swinging out in a lazy arc , the five cables fanning out as they cut through the air .
I could evade , draw closer- and the hand itself got in my way .   
As I moved , so did it , staying between Cradle and I.
I was quicker than the hand , and I could change my path and catch him off guard , but other hands moved , complicating things .   
It would be too easy for hands to close in around me .
Above me , cables were swung up , and they connected to another hand , extending from the fingertips of one hand to the fingertips of another .
That ’d be the barrier I ran into , then .
As I flew around , they broke free , snapping out with more force than a swing would provide .   
They hit me- hit the Wretch , and knocked us off course .
I shouted at a volume that made my throat hurt , “ You left yourself out , Cradle !
”
Again , another glance my way , before he turned his focus to other things .
“
He did all that
to Love Lost and Snag , he did n’t do anything to you ?
”
I chose those words with some intent .   
Not just to ask what Rain did , but to imply there was nothing , and invite the retort .
“
He took people and things from them ! ”
Cradle roared out his response , so he could be heard .   
“
He took me from me !
”
With that last exclamation , it was an actual show of emotion- not that he had n’t said emotional things , but it was the first time he ’d put the emotion out there .
Out of the corner of my eye , I saw Chris sit down rather heavily , clawed hands raised .   
He was bleeding in multiple places , and he did n’t have any fight left in him .
Operator Red turned toward the rest of us , and walked away from Chris , cleavers in hand .
Combat thinkers .   
Worse in a lot of ways than fighting someone like my mom , with her energy weapons .   
She could slice a grown man in half with her weapons .   
A combat thinker ?   
There were ones who could hammer at you psychologically by mirroring mannerisms of people you knew or feared , ones who could hit your nerves or arteries any time , with any strike or weapon they had at hand , and there were ones who could win most fights without trying , because they had the fighting skills without working for those skills , combat precognition , or they saw the fight move at a hundredth the speed .
I was mentally slotting this asshole in that broader ‘ win without trying’ category .   
There might have been some of the former , though , if Snag ’s team been drawn to him .   
The awareness of biology and weak points could both help in combat and in torture .
“
He took you from you ?
”
I asked Cradle , keeping one eye on Operator .   
Cradle was looking up at me .
I did have his attention now .   
Objective achieved , I guessed .
“ I was getting everything set up , finally living the life I wanted to live , and he fucked it all up .   
He pulled me into this , he infected me , and now I ’m different !
”
I opened my mouth to respond , to retort , bait out more and keep Cradle
’s attention , so we could figure out a way to get Rain away .   
If Vista could get to Sveta and
Rain-
and it looked like she was heading
that way-
“
He violated my self ! ”
Cradle
’s words were more raw than any others I ’d heard from him .   
Angrier .
My train of thought stopped where it was , as Cradle ’s words entered my head and overrode everything else .   
In those four words , I got Cradle .
There were so many responses I wanted to give , about everything from the preceding events , the event , and everything that followed …
It was upbringing .   
Really questionable upbringing , sometimes or even a lot of the time .
He was in a bad place , desperate , with nobody to turn to .
He regrets it .   
He ’s trying to do better .   
He was willing to turn himself in , even though that was n’t what Cradle wanted or needed .
He did n’t want any of this any more than Cradle did .
It was n’t him that screwed with Cradle like that .   
It was the power , acting according to some alien programming .
No .
There was n’t one response I could give without feeling like I might be compromising my integral self .
Well , there was one response .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
I …
yeah .
”
He was too far away to properly hear me .
I nodded , instead .
“ If you understand , let him die !
”
This time , I shook my head .
“
No , ” I said , knowing he could n’t hear .
That would violate my integral self too .   
Just as much .   
More .
He moved a hand , and the red - highlighted cables swung out , and connected to the ends of other cables , which separated from other fingertips .   
One hand now had cables of double the length .
He repeated the process again .
Arming himself for combat .
Chris was okay , it seemed , limping toward the fight .   
Operator was crawling toward Capricorn and Vista , who had reunited , and who were only a short distance from Sveta .   
Vista was more focused on making the way between Operator and them as steep as possible .
Operator ’s cleavers periodically stabbed into the earth for handholds , as he trudged through muddy field at a forty degree incline .
Cradle swiped his cables at me .   
I flew back and away , evading .   
He swiped again , a backhand , and I barely needed to evade .
Not meant for me .   
He ’d swiped at the camera .
The camera dodged .
The hand shook , and cables reconfigured .   
The one at the middle finger was longer .
One swipe , angled to connect with either me or the camera .   
I hit it with the Wretch , and saw the crimson highlighting twist and distort , as the camera struggled to keep up with the outline of the cable .
The cable hit the ground around the base of Cradle ’s robot , and the soil exploded with the impact .   
Again , that surrounding force .
His version of Rain ’s power .   
Or something he ’d begged and borrowed for , maybe , another tinker
’s tech , modified to work with his gear .   
That was a thing tinkers could do- a thing that drove them into tinker enclaves or the PRT .   
Past tense ‘ drove’ .
That effect meant I could n’t catch it , but I could still deflect .   
Where things got harder was that I was n’t sure of the fallout now .   
The cord was over a hundred feet long now , the arm was twenty five or so feet long , and even if I knocked the cord to one side , I could n’t be sure it would n’t land in a way that put it near teammates .
I closed the distance .   
There were still other cables , and if I could n’t control the whip-
The hand came up .   
I flew to intercept , and hit the back of the hand as hard as I could , before it reached the momentum necessary to flick the whip .   
The impact dented the surface of the hand , but did n’t stop it from raising up , catching me as it rose .   
The movement was too slow for the impact to hurt , but it was an impact , and that impact made my gunshot wound hurt more .   
Again , there was that suggestion that I could pass out if I let myself .
I maneuvered with more care , aura blasting to try to distract Cradle , for all the good it did .
A tinker who ’d had a year to prepare , a team funneling him resources , and apparently a bit of talent to boot .
A hand moved to shield an attack from the side .   
Something crashed against the hand , and Cradle turned his head to look .
Capricorn ’s power .   
Water had splashed against the hand and then turned to stone .
A moment later , there was another .
The hand closed , and the stone broke .
I flew back and up a little , to get a better vantage point .
Capricorn was with Vista and Sveta .   
Capricorn was creating a sphere somewhere between the size of a beachball and basketball , though spikier than either .   
Sveta grabbed it , used her power to fling it from fifty feet behind her to Cradle .
Stone became water , which became stone immediately after impact .
Operator ’s advance had been stymied , as the top of the hill folded up and overhead , creating a ridge he could n’t climb .
He was going around , which only served to give them more time .
Cradle moved his whip hand .   
I smacked it down , then evaded the various cables that swung in my direction , while I waited for the Wretch to return .
Chris was closing the distance , slow as he was , approaching the hands .   
Capricorn unleashed another shot .   
The shot clipped the top of a finger , splashing well over Cradle ’s head , and then the water became stone .   
Each bit of water was now a stone smaller than a fist , raining down on Cradle ’s head .
Vista shouted something .
Good .
Good , this was the part I liked , that did n’t make me miserable .   
Having a team .   
Finding a way to work together and mesh , solving problems .
I just wished it was n’t at the expense of time .
I struck an arm again- getting past the endless barriers was next to impossible , especially when the cables were whipping around and I was vulnerable right after any impact .   
This hit was aimed at destabilizing , putting him on tilt , so he had to adjust , shift weight , and move arms around .
Capricorn and Sveta had been delivering the projectiles at a fairly steady rate .   
Now there was a pause .
“
Above , ” I heard through my earphone .
I got out of dodge .
One shot , larger than the others , fired so high
it had disappeared into the clouds .   
Now it came down , and the descent was guided by my favorite space warper .
Cradle put a hand over his head .
The stone became water at the last moment , but the impact was still enough that the hand came dangerously close to the top of Cradle
’s head .   
Water filtered between the fingers in streams-
and then froze , like the bars of a cage around him .
I flew in , straight for him .
He hurled himself at the bars , at the same moment hands moved apart and the stone shattered .   
The bars had broken just in time that he did n’t collide with them .   
A hand moved to provide footing below him as he descended , bobbed to absorb the impact of the fall .
Was that intuitive sense of how to stay steady on his contraption his mover power ?
It had cost him time , and he was purely on the defensive .   
Chris was climbing up one arm- something Cradle could have easily dealt with , if he was n’t dealing with all of us .
I glanced at Operator , thinker - one bird
’s eye view at work , and saw that he was at the edge of Vista ’s wave - shaped crest of earth .   
A few more steps
and he ’d be able to walk around it and charge them .   
Vista had been too distracted guiding the stone from above to keep tabs on the guy .
“
Operator incoming !
” I shouted .
An arm moved- not the hand or the arm itself , but the elbow that came at me .   
I deflected .
Every second we could n’t end this was a second Rain was bleeding .   
I was worried at how long it had been already .   
I could have flown , but I would have been leaving the others at Cradle
’s mercy .
I renewed my efforts , taking more risks , as I flew in closer .
“
Do n’t dodge , ”
I heard another report .   
Looksee .
Do n’t dodge ?
Capricorn and Sveta hurled another projectile .   
A hand blocked it , then shook off the stone .   
Other hands were warring with Chris , who was slowly climbing , stabbing , and doing a better job than I was at keeping tabs on everything immediately around him .   
It was another distraction for Cradle , but I doubted our changer would manage to get in close if I could n’t , situational awareness or no .
Speaking of-
what was I not supposed to dodge ?
“ Looksee ?
” I asked .
“ One second , fiddling ! ”
Fiddling .
I got within ten feet of Cradle , only for a hand to block me .   
I flew around it- and he was n’t there anymore .
He ’d hopped down to another hand .
The whip hand moved , and I moved to counter .   
I struck it , closer to the elbow than the hand , and the hand slapped down toward the ground .
I went straight from that hit to flying for Cradle , to keep him on his toes and create room for a mistake .
A blur of red in my peripheral vision gave me pause .
The long whip ?   
It was falling down on top of everything .   
Cradle saw it too , moved hands to provide a shield .
I trusted the Wretch , and used the opportunity to hammer him .
The red line passed through everything .   
Projection .   
A feint .   
Cradle had an intuitive sense of where things were , but seeing the red lines had preconditioned him , toyed with that perception as an optical illusion , and with that deception , I could get close enough to make contact .
I grabbed him by the fabric at his back and hauled him up and away .
“ Victoria , ” I heard Tattletale over the phone call .
“
Stop breaking in , please , ”
I heard Looksee ’s reply .
I flew Cradle away from his machine , and dropped him harder than was necessary , relatively close to the others .
Operator was still trying to navigate the Vista - modified battlefield .   
He ’d managed to dodge some traps already , ground cupping over him like a dome , pitfalls .
“
Call off Operator , ” I said .
Cradle was silent .
“
Call him off !
”
“ I need him intact and free , ” Tattletale said , over the phone .
“
Get bent , ” I said .
“ I ’m willing to negotiate , ” she said .
“
Set him in stone , ” I suggested , to Capricorn .   
“
Leave him for the Fallen when they come back .
”
Cradle tensed .
“
You ’re not going to do that , ” Tattletale said .   
“
You ’re too righteous .
”
“ Wah !
” was the distant shout .
I turned to look .   
It was Chris , and Cradle ’s robot was still operating .   
The whip hand was moving-
I flew to intercept , as the whip came around .   
I knocked it away .
“
Again … we can leave you for the Fallen , ”
I told Cradle .   
“
Or you can call Operator off .
”
“ Red ! ”
Cradle called out .   
“ Enough .
”
That meant the assassin was n’t an immediate concern .
“
How ’s our guy ?
” I asked .
“
Not good , ” Sveta said .   
She pressed her forehead to Rain ’s .   
“
He ’s not really breathing .   
He ’s cold .
”
“ Advance Guard .   
They have a healer , ” Tattletale said .
“ I know , ” I said , annoyed .   
“ Go away .   
You led them right to him , did n’t you ?   
Through our video and phones ?
”
“
Yes , but not like that .   
It does n’t matter .
”
“
It matters , ” I said .   
I bent down by Rain .   
Capricorn gave me a hand in scooping him up .   
I checked to make sure the robot was being good .
“
We can handle this now , ” Capricorn said .   
“
Get him help .
” I nodded .
I flew .   
Advance Guard had been to the northern end of everything , where a road exited the settlement .   
There were some sparse buildings in that direction , but it looked to be mainly for logging and maybe some quarrying as well .
“ Victoria , ” Tattletale said .
“ I can kick her off , ” Looksee said .   
“
I think I figured it out now .
”
“
I ’ll talk to her , ” I said .
“
The Crowleys came out ahead in this .   
I know they ’ve got a reputation that makes people underestimate them , but their own people were just attacked .   
They ’ll be out for blood , and the Fallen have far more reach than you ’d imagine .
”
“ I do n’t know what you ’re getting at , ” I said .   
I checked my charge .   
Rain was limp .   
No fight , no response to anything .
“
Let Cradle go .   
I ’ll keep him and Love Lost out of your way .   
He promised to help me after I helped him here .   
Do that for me
and I will help you .
”
“ You were talking about the Fallen .
”
“ I ’ll coordinate .   
I can get you March and what ’s left of Prancer
’s band .   
The Crowleys are already on their way out , they ’re hitting the road , we can hit them before they get where they ’re going .
”
“ I do n’t know what games you ’re playing , Tattletale , but one of mine might be dead .   
Someone I pledged to help and keep alive .   
You pointed the killers to him .   
You were a cog in
Snag and Prancer ’s thing , and that turned out pretty shitty .   
How much of that was intentional ?
”
“
That ’s the kind of conspiracy thinking that gets you put in an institution , ” Tattletale said .
“
Either you ’re incompetent or you ’re malicious , ”
I said .   
“
Neither lends themselves to us working together .
“
Or I ’m
wrestling with bigger things , Victoria , ” she sighed out the words , sounding exasperated , annoyed .
I spotted the first glimmer of color in the trees .   
I flew closer .
“ I made my offer .   
Feel free to accept it , ” she said .
“
She ’s gone , ” Looksee said .
There was a pause .
“
Is he really that bad ?
” she asked .
“ I do n’t know , ” I said .   
I was n’t willing to spare the time to check , either .   
“
But if this does n’t work- ” I did n’t finish the sentence .
If this does n’t work , thinking about all the responses I could n’t give Cradle
… would I be willing to try another route ?
Another healer ?
I dropped down the rest of the way , through the largest gap in the foliage .
Not Advance Guard .   
Prancer and his team- half the size it had been , and that was after the defection of Beast of Burden .
Prancer had no Velvet at his side , and he had no Moose .   
He did have a dark expression on his face , one that darkened further as he recognized me .
“
Advance Guard ?
” I asked .
He pointed .
Northeast .
No fight , no resistance .   
I just hoped he had n’t lied .
He had n’t lied .   
Advance Guard was with the patrol block , and the patrol block was trying to corral a hero team and somewhat hostile evacuees who outnumbered them four to one .
I landed in the center of the camp .
I spotted Mayday with Gilpatrick .
“ Healer ?
” I asked .
I saw the hesitation , and my heart sank .   
The sick feeling was worse .
“
Is your healer hurt ?
” I asked .
“
He’s- he ’s here , ” Mayday said .   
“ Unhurt .
”
“
But ?
”
“
But everything went to shit , ” Mayday said .   
“
Come .
” I followed , giving Gilpatrick a look over my shoulder .   
He was already talking to others , the moment Mayday was gone .   
Things to do , people to coordinate .   
It looked like other leaders of other patrols , that he was helping to coordinate .
One of the buses had the remnants of Advance Guard around it .   
Mayday hopped up and hauled on the lever to open the emergency door of the bus .   
Capes converged , ready to guard
The cape wore a goat mask , golden , and a black costume .   
He sat on one of the benches of the bus .   
There were others in the bus , men and women in cuffs .
Now that I looked , the cape had cuffs on as well .
“
This is Scapegoat , ” Mayday said .   
“
He can heal .   
Sort of .   
It ’s complicated .
”
“
It always is .   
What happened , Scapegoat ?
” I asked .   
I used flight to stead myself as I dropped low .
“ I do n’t know , ” he said .
“
He went Fallen , ” someone supplied .
“
He ’s not the only one , ” Mayday said .   
“
We had one other , who died in the scrap .   
A lot of people were looking for answers after the end of the world , and the Fallen were promising them .
” Scapegoat shrugged .
Reach , as Tattletale had put it .
I wanted to ask him things , to shake him , to push for more than a shrug .   
I imagined a lot of people did .
But I needed his help .
I draped Rain out on the road .   
Scapegoat looked down at him .
“
Hey , ” I said .   
I pressed a finger to his pulse .
I could n’t tell if there was something there or if it was my feeling my own pulse reverberating through .
But he moved .   
His head shifted slightly as he looked at me , eyes flickering as he tried to open them – but one was cut and the other was crusted with blood .
“ I want someone to heal you , ” I said .   
“
Okay ?   
Hey .   
I need your okay .
”
I saw his head move a fraction , then again .
When he tried again , there was more of a nod .
I looked up at Scapegoat .   
He looked away , looked at Mayday .
“ You want to play games
, Scapegoat ?
” Mayday asked .
“
Not games , ” Scapegoat said , voice soft .   
“
But I ’ve helped you a lot already , and it does n’t seem like my situation is any better .   
My power sucks to use .
”
“ I got a message from Tattletale , ” Looksee reported , coming in over the phone .   
“
Tell Scapegoat Tattletale says to , and that he needs the goodwill .   
He needs a lot of it .
”
I did n’t hesitate .   
“ Tattletale .   
She says to .   
You need goodwill , here .
”
He paused .
A tense moment later , he nodded , crouched , and held his hands over Rain .   
He looked up at Mayday .   
“
Can you get him warm ?
”
“ We have blankets , ” Mayday said .   
“ Shortcut , grab some .
”
I did n’t look for my would - be nemesis ; my focus was on Rain and on Scapegoat , making sure Rain was safe , as flickering images overlapped with him .
“ You ’ll need help too ?
”
Scapegoat asked .
My gunshot wound .   
He ’d seen the bloody bandages .
“
No , ” I said .   
“
I ’ll heal it naturally .
”
He seemed to take that in a matter of fact way .
There were more things to handle .   
Tattletale wanted to cooperate to wrap this up in a better way , and I was not ready to forget or forgive her role in this .   
I did n’t want to engage in life and death calculus , as Sveta had put it .
I pressed a hand to my ear , so it was clearer that I was talking to someone .
“ Looksee , I ’m not sure if you can see-
”
“ I ca n’t .   
My cameras are down or repurposed .
”
“ I think he ’s getting the help he needs
, okay ?
”
“ Okay .
”
The minutes passed as the injuries disappeared .   
Ashley joined us , with Gilpatrick standing behind her .   
Her power sparked a few times , and Scapegoat said something .   
She moved to situate herself further back , in a place where she could still watch .
I was n’t sure what to say or do- a smile felt wrong , I could n’t think of what to say that would n’t be too casual , too personal , or too confrontational .
I raised a hand in a bit of a wave .   
She did the same with her good hand .
For now , I could put everything out of mind for the moment .   
At the very least , I ’d stand watch over Rain like nobody watched over me .
“ Looksee , ” I said , hand at my ear .
“
Yeah ?
”
“ Tell Tattletale
I ’m willing to consider it , but I want something else on the table .
”
“
Yeah ? ”








Narwhal faced down the Fallen , standing in the middle of the road .   
A crowd of patrol block soldiers stood behind her , with the buses lined up .
The soldiers with guns were only slightly less intimidating than the array of forcefields she ’d conjured up , arranged above and to either side of her with the blades pointing forward , each one slightly tilted in angle compared to the one next to it , so they all pointed at the one point ahead of us .
I floated above her .
“
It ’s over , ” Narwhal called out .   
“ The Crowleys are running , the Mathers leadership is gone .   
Half of your town was leveled and legitimate authorities are going to be staying there to make sure everything ’s healthy as people move back in .
”
And we ’ll provide some resources to anyone that wants out for good , I thought .   
I hope that pans out .
“
Healthy , ” the Fallen woman in the lead said .   
“
Healthy food is stuff you have to choke down .   
Healthy body means doing grueling work .   
That ’s
you saying it ’s going to fucking suck .
”
Yeah , she did n’t look like someone who ate her vegetables .
“ I ’ve done this kind of thing before .   
I fought warlords , ” Narwhal said .   
“
I helped the villages after .   
I delivered supplies to isolated settlements .   
A lot of people want this to have a happy ending , and experience tells me that ending is possible .
”
A guy called out , “ The only happy ending I want is the kind you use your hand for , bitch !
”
There was some raucous , tense laughter from the group .
I felt such disgust , looking at them .   
It was n’t the joke-
I could imagine Chris or Rain saying something like that
and it being something that pushed the envelope .   
They would n’t have said ‘ bitch’ , though .
I could n’t understand them .
My phone buzzed .   
I flew to the ground , off to the side of Narwhal , and brought my phone to my ear .
“ Tattletale here .   
Can we talk ?
”
“ Standoff with the remaining Mathers Fallen and Narwhal , ” I said .   
I assessed the situation .   
“
I think Narwhal has it handled .
”
“ I ’d think so .   
I ’ve found the Crowleys , they covered their retreat , and now they ’re on the move .   
They borrowed a fleet of cars from a town north of here , and they ’re heading east .
”
“ East ?   
Boston ?   
New Brockton ?
”
“
I ’m betting the Boston district of the Megalopolis , ” she said .   
“
They ’re taking a route using roads that are barely roads , they ’re so rustic .   
If you take the major highway , you could get ahead of them with time to spare .   
Give me what I need and we ’ll help .
”
“ We being ? ”
“ Undersiders .   
I can twist Prancer ’s arm , promise to help him bounce back if he ’ll lend me people .   
I could also give you the information for March .   
She ’d help , but it would have to come from you , not me .
”
“
Do I want her help ?
”
“
She ’d do the job
and she ’d do it well , if she thought it would help Rain .
”
“
But ?
” I asked .   
I was still keeping an eye on the situation with Narwhal and the Fallen .
“
You know the Graeae twins ?   
They ’re part of her group .
”
“ A bit .   
They helped Rain out .
”
“
They were two of three , originally .   
They had another brother , and they ’re triplets and cluster - mates at the same time .   
Big bro went off the deep end .   
Kiss and kill are messy enough when you ’ve got family bonds , but the brother went full kiss , full kill , at the same time , like where the venn diagram overlaps .
”
I felt my skin crawl , and darker thoughts bubbled up , as I drew some parallels .   
I kept my voice level as I said , “ I ’ve read about that .
”
“
Whichever order that goes in , it ’s …
it ’s not good , Victoria .
”
“
Thanks , ” I said , my voice curt .   
“
Let ’s speed along to the explanation .
”
“ With my power , I can usually figure people out .   
With March , I ca n’t .   
When that happens , it ’s because there is no answer , or
I ’m
asking the wrong question .
”
That was more information than I ’d ever had about Tattletale ’s power and its limitations .
“
You should know
I ’m
baring my throat and showing you some weaknesses as a gesture of good faith , ” Tattletale said .
Or as a manipulation tactic .
I watched the Fallen advance a little , but kept up my end of the call .   
In a pinch , I would fly in and stall .   
I drew out the thrust of Tattletale ’s explanation , something that I seemed to have to do with regularity .   
“
You think you ca n’t figure out if March is one or the other because she ’s both ?
”
“ Or neither , but
saying it ’s
neither would mean
it ’s
so far afield
it ’s not sensible .   
Which would fit her .   
Either way , if she really likes someone , that is n’t a good thing .
”
“ You ’re saying not to rely on her , then ?
”
“ Know what you ’re getting into .   
She ’d be useful to have if you pick this fight .   
It ’s a lot of Fallen and they ’ll be going to
somewhere there are friends .
”
“
Understood , ” I said .   
I was distracted as I replied ; the Fallen were more agitated now .
“ We know they ’re projections !
” the Fallen woman jeered .
Narwhal looked at one of her team members .   
I imagined it was the kind of disappointed look that went with a sigh .
She looked at me , and I nodded .
My phone beeped , loud .   
I twisted my head around , burying my eyes in the crook of my elbow , bringing out the Wretch .
The flash was so bright I could briefly see my bones through my arm , with everything else being a mottled pink .
The Fallen were left partially or wholly blind .   
Some screamed , others opened fire .   
Narwhal already had her barrier up .   
The forcefields glowed as they absorbed the fire .
Our trap worked .
“
Sounds like you ’re busy .   
We ’ll meet , and you can bring some of your people this time , if you want .   
You can glare at me , I ’ll fill you in on the why and the what .
”
“
That ’s only if we agree .
”
“
Let ’s keep this simple , Victoria .   
I ’m trying to play ball .
”
“
You were ops for an assassin that came after my teammate .
”
“
I ’m trying to play ball with this .   
If you put him in jail , I might have to break him out , or he ’s going to break out on his own .   
He ’s a tinker , among other things .   
The places they ’ve got are n’t that good , trust me .
”
“ If you or your people help him , we ’re actually going to have a problem , ” I said .   
“
But whether we release him in exchange for your help is n’t up to me .
”
“ I ’ll send you some stuff .   
Use it to convince others .
” ⊙ Captain Marcial scrolled through my phone logs .   
Another captain , Gaymon , was standing next to her , arms folded , watching the screen .
“
Using this phone is a hassle , ” Gaymon said .
“ I ’d have given you better if I had better , ” I said .   
“
She texted all that to me , and I do n’t know how to put texts on a laptop , or where I would even get a laptop out here .
”
“
Whatever , ” Gaymon said .
I frowned a bit , but I did n’t want to make an issue of things .   
I knew some of the patrol blocks were more anti - cape than Gilpatrick ’s , and Gaymon had given me that vibe and cemented it in place with his attitude .
Gilpatrick , Sveta and Chris were next to me .   
Ashley was a short distance away in the company of ‘ Jester’ , the both of them sitting on a rock by the ditch .   
Rain was lying across the long seat at the rear end of a bus , resting and avoiding any and all disturbances after the attention from Scapegoat .
Shortcut from Advance Guard was lurking around the periphery .   
Thankfully , he was staying quiet and sticking to the background .
“
This Tattletale , you trust her ?
” Marcial asked .   
She was a slim woman , with a nose that had been broken at least twice , and a thin old scar that parted her eyebrow .   
Like Gilpatrick , she was ex - PRT .   
She wore a raincoat that was open in the front , because it could n’t close around her body armor .   
The hood kept the drizzle off of her face .
“
No , ” I said .   
“
I do n’t really trust her .
”
“
Not so compelling , then , ” she said , looking back down at the phone .
“
It ’s … not a point in her favor , ” I said .   
“
But I ’d rather operate under the assumption that she ’s telling the truth about where the Fallen are and what they ’re doing .   
I ’m going to go after them and , if she turns out to be right , put myself at risk .   
If she ’s wrong , I ’m flying for a few hours when all I want to do is get my gunshot wound looked at .   
Take that for what it ’s worth .
”
“
So you do trust her .
”
“ I trust that the Fallen are dangerous .   
That trust means I ’m willing to accept the hassle and the risk .
”
“ That Tattletale is yanking our dicks ?
”
Captain Marcial asked , her voice about as uncaring and dry as was possible .
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“ Children present , ” Sveta said , quiet .   
Her arms were folded , and one finger moved , pointing at Chris .
“
I do n’t care , ” Chris said .
“ I do n’t care either , ” Marcial said .   
“
If they can fight , they can hear some bad language .   
This feels like a wild goose chase or a trap .   
We ’ve already been stung a few times .
”
“ We know they went somewhere .   
Our tinker thinks there ’s reason to believe Tattletale is right .   
They used guns today , multiple witnesses can testify they put civilians in the line of fire to use as human shields , and tortured others .   
There ’s a chance they bring that behavior to a settlement .   
I think it ’s worth using the only lead we have , after they slipped our perimeter .
”
“
They being the Crowleys ?
”
“
Yes , ” I said .   
“ Possibly with some scattered Mathers , and the Clans , and the remaining Bikers .
”
I was n’t sure how keen the Bikers would be when it came to playing along , but I was n’t going to bring that up .   
Marcial ’s approach was n’t warming me to her , and I was reluctant to give her fuel for her suspicions and delaying tactics .   
It was her call when it came to her patrol group and what they were prepared to do .   
She had authority over her group in the field like Gilpatrick had for the Bridgeport patrol .
I was keenly aware of Captain Marcial ’s geographical position , as well .   
She was in charge of the patrol block from New Haven .   
They were the closest neighbors to the Mathers camp of Fallen .   
The same town with the shop where I ’d picked up the donuts , and with the people who ’d been camped out watching for trouble , that Looksee had fooled and helped bring into custody .
If anyone was going to turn out to be a Fallen sympathizer , a thing that was happening with some frequency , I would n’t be shocked if that anyone was Captain Marcial .
“ Crowleys are n’t on paper as being a big threat , ” she said .
“ Crowleys are n’t on paper as having gun toting soldiers either , ” I said .
“ We took the same road they did when we came here , ” Chris said .   
“
You can smell the gunpowder in the air , mixed with the smell of cigarettes , alcohol , gasoline and body odor .
”
“ You can , Chris , ” Sveta said , stressing the ‘ you’ .
Gaymon ’s superior approached .   
I ’d caught the man being called Captain Bash , but I was n’t sure if it was a nickname or real last name .   
He did n’t look like a Bash , with a shorter than average stature , skinny physique and a bit of a receding hairline-
I could imagine it being the sort of thing where a tall muscular man was nicknamed Tiny .   
The PRT director in my hometown had confided in me at one point that she ’d been nicknamed Lady , and from her lack of grace and finer manners , it might have been the same sort of thing .
Bash indicated the phone , “
What ’s this ?
”
“ Villain says she knows where the Crowley bunch went , after Scapegoat helped them push past our perimeter .   
Gilpatrick ’s cape says they want to follow up on it .   
If this is to be believed , the Fallen went north , to the Meridian stretch , and then they ’ll go east .
”
“ To a populated part of the city , ” I pointed out .
“
And ?
” Bash asked .
“ We ’re trying to decide if it ’s worth going after the jackasses , ” Gaymon said .
“
It ’s more complicated than that .   
We can get better info , but it costs , ” I said .   
“
And I need the approval of my whole team on this , first .   
I want to make sure we have the other resources we need if we ’re going to pay this cost or convince the rest of my team .   
If we can work with what we ’ve got , though , that ’d be ideal .
”
“
I ’ll defer to Gilpatrick and Marcial , ” Bash said .   
“
You make the call , we ’ll help , whatever happens .
”
“
Again , ” I said , trying not to let the combination of Chris and Bash sidetrack things too much , “ We have witnesses .   
They came armed and they fought hard .   
This was n’t the prankster , pain in the ass , public nuisance Crowleys .   
This was something more vicious .
”
“ Because they were defending their home ?
” Marcial suggested .
“
I trust her , Liz , ” Gilpatrick said , speaking just a moment before I said something I would have regretted later .   
“
If she says it was serious , I believe her .
”
“
This is your girl from the community center ?
” I frowned .
“
She is , ” Gilpatrick said .
“
The wrecking ball .
”
Fuck me , was she trying to push me ?
“
She kept my people alive and safe .   
She protected civilians .   
Considering the fudge - cluster that was , I ’m happy with how she handled it .
”
“
Disaster follows in your heroine
’s wake , huh ?
”
Marcial asked , still in that same dry tone .
I closed my eyes , then measured out my response ,
“
It ’s my feeling that when you have powers , it ’s your responsibility to take action in the face of disaster .   
So
yeah , you ’re going to see me a lot on the scene of bad stuff going down .
”
“ Cluster fudge , bad stuff , ” Chris said .   
“
You do n’t need to censor for my benefit .   
I promise you , I ’ve heard worse .   
I ’ve said worse .
”
“ Do n’t interrupt , ” Sveta told him .
“ I understand that you ’re defensive , Victoria .   
You put a lot on the line , ” Marcial said .
“
I ’m
not-
” I started .   
I clenched my fist .
“
It ’s okay .   
This is how I function .   
Ask anyone who works under me .   
I ’m
asking the questions others are going to ask after we ’re done .   
Why do this , are we sure , was n’t there some indication it was a trap ?   
Succeed or fail , they ’re going to wonder , and I intend to have the right answers for them .
”
“
Okay , ” I said , though I did n’t feel okay with it .   
The annoying thing with how she ‘ functioned’ was that I had a hard time going back and finding the thread of the conversation again .   
Chris’ commentary did n’t help .   
“ Defending their home , you said .
”
“
Mm hmm , ” she said .   
She looked at Gaymon as he nudged her .
“
The supporting images are n’t very clear , ” Gaymon interrupted , holding up my phone .   
“ Especially on a screen this small .
”
“
Yeah , ” she acknowledged him .   
“
I do n’t think anyone has satellite footage that ’s worth three fucks , yet .
”
I pressed , “ They were armed and ready for a small war .   
This is n’t limited to the guns people brought with them and the rifles they had for hunting .   
There were assault rifles and whole groups with a matching gun in each person
’s hand .
”
“
I bet if you asked them , they ’d say it was a good thing they were armed and ready , since a small war came to them , ” she said .   
When she saw my expression , she added , “ I ’m anticipating the responses we ’ll get , that ’s all .
”
I took a deep breath .   
“
Okay .   
Do you have any questions ?   
Do you need anything ?
”
“
Do you want your phone back ?
” she asked .
I started to approach , and she tossed the phone my way .   
I had to fly a bit to catch it one - handed .
“
We ’ll let you know what we decide , ” Gaymon said .
I turned to walk away , and Gilpatrick told his peers , “ I ’ll be right back .
”
He walked with me , as I walked up to Sveta and Chris , put a hand on Sveta ’s shoulder , and had us all walk over to where Jester was talking to Ashley .   
From there , I indicated we should walk a little further away for our pow - wow .
“
Sorry , ” Gilpatrick said .   
“
That is how she operates .
”
“
She make a lot of friends with that ‘ function’ of hers ?
”
“
No , ” Gilpatrick said .   
“
I ’d never pretend she has many allies or friends .   
She was New York PRT , and if you ask the New York PRT , they ’ll say-
they would have said that they were the best in the country .
“
A few PRT teams would have said that , ” I replied , with a sigh .   
“
Does she live up to her own hype ?
”
Gilpatrick gave me a one - shouldered shrug .   
“
Her ass is so covered
it ’s bulletproof , and that ’s a skill a lot of people overlook .   
People who matter trust her when she talks because she is very good at explaining things to people who know nothing .   
Again , a skill .
”
“ That definitely does n’t make friends if she wins important people over to her side when multiple others try and fail , ” I said .
“
I wo n’t comment , ” Gilpatrick said , in a conspiratorial way I was n’t sure someone else would catch .   
I was right .   
It was something that had happened .
“
That ’s politics .   
Is she good at her job ?
”
“
Depends on what you see as her job .   
I ’d like to think I ’m a better teacher and shaper of our youth .   
She ’s better at going after the bad guys .
”
“ Worrying .
”
We met with Ashley , where she ’d found a rock to lean against .   
Jasper put the phone down beside her , then walked over to stand by Gilpatrick .   
I really wondered what he ’d been talking to Ashley about , and why he ’d even gone to talk to her in the first place .
“
How ’s everyone ?
” I asked .
“ Patched up , ” Sveta said , patting her prosthetic shell .
“
Good , ” Chris said .   
“
Did what I wanted , mostly .
”
I raised an eyebrow at that .   
He ’d seemed slightly dissatisfied earlier .   
He only shrugged .
“ I ’ve been talking to Jester and Looksee , getting caught up , ” Ashley said .   
“
It ’s a good distraction .
”
“
Ooh , she ’s into archery , ” Looksee said .   
The phone rested on the rock between Jasper and Ashley .   
“ Badass .
”
Ashley raised a hand , indicating the phone , “ See ?   
Distraction enough .
”
“
Wait , ” I said .   
“
Say again , Looksee .   
Who is into archery ?
”
“ Marcial .
”
“ Why Marcial ?
”
“
Because she ’s our biggest obstacle , and I was looking for clues .
”
“ Looksee , you ca n’t spy on people , ” I said .
“ Please , ” Sveta said .
“
Is it really spying if the information is a mouseclick away ?
”
“
Yes , ” Chris said .
“
Oh , hey , Creepy Kid .   
Tattletale was asking about you .   
I did n’t say anything , of course .
”
“
I ’m apparently Creepy Kid now , ” Chris said , to Sveta and I. “
I told you , you need to pick a name , or it ’s going to get chosen for you , ”
I said .
“ I do n’t have good ideas , ” Chris said .   
“ The good names are taken .   
The shortlist is Dramaturge , Cryptid , Cryptozoo-
”
Looksee snorted audibly over the phone .
“
Do n’t laugh , Looksee , ” exaggerating her name .
“ Looksee is good !   
Victoria said you can make any name work if you do good enough , and I did good today .
”
“
Well enough , ” Chris said .
“ Everyone did well , ” I said .   
“
You included , Looksee .   
I know that was n’t as close to the frontline as you want , but the camera drop , outlining the cables- ” “ Threads , ” Looksee said .   
“ With force around and to them .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .   
“ And
the fake cable coming at Cradle .   
It was good .
”
“
She was telling me about it , ” Ashley said .
“
It was good ,
” I said .
“ If you keep saying that , she ’s going to blow a fuse , ” Chris said .
“
Oh , completely changing the subject , Capricorn is coming back with Vista .   
He ’s a couple of minutes away .
”
“ I ’ll go say hi in a second , ” I said .
“ This whole thing is dizzying , ” Jester said .   
“
I do n’t know how you do it .
”
“
In a way , I grew up with it , ” I said .   
“ Was different , back then .   
I dealt with more known quantities .   
Or I thought I did .   
No Marcials .   
I never thought I ’d miss having my mom as team leader once I flew the coop .   
I considered it a good day when my aunt was the one in charge , and I still found it stifling .
”
“
It ’s not all people like Marcial , ” Gilpatrick said .
“ I know , ” I said .   
I had to make a three - quarter turn to lightly punch him in the arm , because my injured arm was the one closer to him .   
“
We ’ve got people like you and Jester .
”
“
The fact that you ’re using that name and you ’re putting us in the same sentence pains me , ” Gilpatrick did n’t move his lips as he murmured the words .
Jester cleared his throat , looking at Gilpatrick .
“ I ’ll give you one thing , ” Chris was saying in the background , “ The camera thing was a good play .   
Brutal .
”
“
Thank you , nice of you to say , ” Looksee said .
“
It was , ” Sveta said , “
But I do n’t like how that was worded .   
Brutal and good should n’t be put together like that .
” Chris went on , “ I wanted to make a joke before , but speaking takes concentration when you do n’t have the mouth you ’re used to .   
Now it sounds dumb , because I ’d be saying it out of nowhere .
”
“
Say it .   
Say it , ” Looksee said .
“ Looksee ?   
More like look out , ” Chris said , and he chose the most deadpan tone of voice he could manage , in a way that sucked any of the residual humor out of the line .
Looksee laughed all the same .
“ I hate to be a wet blanket , ” Sveta said .   
“
But ,   please , almost caving in someone
’s skull was an emergency measure , not a thing to be encouraged .
”
“
Seconding that , ” I said .
“ You seem to have your hands full , ” Gilpatrick said .
“
Feels like it , ” I said .   
Even if I had perfect control of the Wretch , every hand available would be full .
Ugh .   
I did n’t like thinking like that .
“
You guys talk , ” I said .   
“
I ’m going to go see Capricorn .   
He should be there soon .
”
“
He paused to rest , ” Looksee reported .   
“
He ’s a minute away .
”
“ Good enough , ” I said .
“ I ’ll come , ” Ashley said .
I hesitated .   
I ’d wanted to fly .   
“ We ’ll walk fast ?
”
She nodded .
We skirted the larger meeting , where Mayday had joined the discussion with Marcial , Bash , and Gaymon .   
Gilpatrick took my leaving as an excuse to go , too , but he took a separate path .
Only Ashley and me .
“
What did you talk to Jester about ?
” I asked .
“ We did n’t talk much .   
He brought the phone , and he managed it
so I did n’t have to , asked how you were doing
, we talked briefly about you .   
He was curious about powers .   
Looksee did most of the talking .
”
“
Talking about me ?
”
“ Nothing bad , ” she said .
I looked back over my shoulder .   
The group was still gathered .   
“ They ’re doing better than expected .   
Sveta ’s quiet .
”
“
They ’re relieved that Rain is okay , ” Ashley said .   
“
And they ’re resilient .
”
“
And you ?
” I asked .   
“
Are you okay ?
”
“
You said everyone did a good job .   
I did n’t , ” Ashley said .   
She walked with her hand clasped around the injured portion , but the posture looked defensive .
“ I really liked how you handled things with Gilpatrick , turning yourself in , asking him if you could join the fight .   
They ’re the right moves .
”
“ If I end up imprisoned and unable to see or call her , someone needs to look after Kenzie .
” I looked at Ashley .   
Her hair had dried somewhat , but it still had the wet hair look , where it webbed into thicker locks .   
She was wearing the new dress- the one she ’d bought in Cedar Point , but it had been melted at the side , near where her wrist dangled by her leg .   
Since the capture the flag game , I ’d thought of Kenzie looking after Ashley in a way , but I was n’t so sure I ’d seen Ashley looking after Kenzie .   
Defending her , maybe .   
Being there- “ Being there for her ?
” I asked .
“
It ’s part of it , ” she said .   
“
She does n’t have anyone .
”
“ Does n’t she ?
”
“
I mean someone who will be there a year from now .   
The team is wobbly , none of her classmates want to be her friend , and very few people spend time with her without wanting something from her or having to be with her .   
When I get in trouble for blasting Beast of Burden , make sure she has someone .   
You or someone else .
” I nodded .   
“
Her parents ?
”
“
Go to that dinner at her house or ask the others if you want an answer to that question .
” I tilted my head a little , trying to see more of her face .   
“
Usually I can count on you for straight answers .
”
“ Not about this .   
She ’d be upset with me and things are hard enough .   
She ’s upset with me
and I ’m upset with her .   
The talk on the phone , with a bystander there , we were dancing around being upset with each other .
”
“
Did I miss something ?
” I asked .
Ashley shook her head .   
She moved her injured hand , bouncing it up and down briefly , then clenched her other hand at her arm as a muffled use of her power erupted between her fingers .   
Agitation .
“ I could have screamed at her .   
It ’s why I wanted this talk .
”
“
What happened ?
”
“
I ’m not sure , but she was trying to reassure me .   
She said the situation was bad , there were lots of people hurt , Rain killed Snag
, he was almost killed by Cradle , and even she almost killed Mama Mathers .
”
Ashley gave that last bit some emphasis .
“ You think it was intentional ?   
To connect , or … ”
“ I do n’t know .   
She said it and I ca n’t get it out of my head .   
If it was intentional , even if it was accidental , if she killed someone , if she ruined herself like that , for something so stupid , or because she was careless , if she ’s even capable of making that kind of decision-
” She was getting agitated as she talked .
“ I get it , ” I said , interrupting the speech .   
“ I get it .   
We ’ll figure something out .   
I ’ll talk to her .
”
We walked for a short bit in silence .   
I heard Ashley whisper something , but it was n’t aimed at me .
I chose to ignore the whisper , in the same way I hoped someone would ignore me communicating something to the Wretch .
“
She needs someone to look after her , ” Ashley said .   
“
Now that someone ca n’t be me .
” I looked up .   
The sky was still overcast , the light of the sun fighting to shine through in a way that made it look more like the heavy clouds had faint energy glowing from within them , rather than a distant burning orb sending its light to us .
“ I do n’t know what ’s going to happen to the team , ” I said .   
“
I think people are more shaken than they ’re saying .
”
“ They are .
”
“
There was a lot there that was rough .   
There ’s still stuff out there- angry people with guns , who just saw their own get attacked , or who were forced to act by Mama Mathers .   
Good people got really hurt .
”
“ Bad people got really hurt too ,
” Ashley said .
I paused , feeling the weight of that short statement .   
“
Yeah .   
We ’ll see how that goes .
”
Water pattered against my hood , and I thought the rain had started up again-
it was only the wind stirring the droplets from the leaves above .
I saw the distorted space before I saw Capricorn , Vista , and Chasmal .   
Capricorn had one of his stone constructions over his shoulder , something that looked like a coffin , but was obviously made of Tristan ’s power , with hooks and such .   
Interestingly , though it looked like the sort of heavy something that would have required Tristan ’s attention , it was Byron in the blue armor who was hauling it , holding up the thicker , wider upper end , with the bottom end dragging in the path behind him .
Vista was shortening their path .   
Chasmal would be making the coffin and the person inside light enough for Byron to drag , while simultaneously phasing Mama Mathers partially out of reality .
He had a costume that sported Advance Guard ’s geometric future aesthetic with a deep blue color scheme with orange trim .   
The aesthetic and design seemed to be intended at invoking the dark , vigilante style .
I was really hoping that a measure like that would sever her connection to others , for any point in time that she woke up .
“ You got her ?
” I asked .
“
Yeah .   
We also pointed Mayday ’s cape and the patrol crew to the building we sealed up , ” Byron said .   
“
Hi , Damsel .
”
“
Hi .
”
“
She ’s still unconscious or asleep in there ?
” I asked .
“ Has to be .   
I ’d have felt her struggling , or we would have heard her .
”
“
She could be dead , ” Damsel said .
“
Let ’s hope , ” Chasmal muttered .
“
I ’m hoping she is n’t , ” I said .   
Damsel nodded her agreement with me .
“
I used my power to sweep over the area , ” Vista said .   
“
I can get a general feel for when there are people somewhere and as far as I can tell , most of the town was evacuated .   
We sent some people to rescue and retrieve .
”
“ Armed , armored people , ” Byron said .
“
But I think we did it , ” Vista said .   
She offered her fist out .   
After a moment ’s hesitation , Byron bumped it .   
I was a little quicker to respond .
Vista offered her fist to Ashley , and Ashley shook her head , flashing a small smile instead .
Vista seemed to take it in stride .   
“
There were two groups that left .   
One to the south- ” “ Handled , ” I said .   
“ Projections stopped them , even though they knew they were projections .   
They lined up to face down our defending group , and we blinded them .
”
“
And the second one that tore through Advance Guard and the Hollow Point villains as they left by the north road .
”
I wished I had a better answer for her .   
“
We ’re still figuring that one out .
”
“ I hear Prancer ’s group skedaddled ?
” Vista asked .
“
What ’s left of it .   
They took a few bodies with them .
”
“
Eesh , ” Byron said .
“
Eesh is right , ”
I answered him .   
“
They ’ll go back to Hollow Point and they ’ll probably find one of the Wardens’ teams waiting there .   
The Shepherds or Foresight .   
With luck , they ’ll be so tired they wo n’t want to fight for the territory , or they ’ll lose that fight if they pick it .
”
“ We ’re not invited ?
” Byron asked .
I shook my head .   
“ We were n’t invited , we ’re battered and weary , and I think I ’d rather deal with the Fallen , if we were going to do something .
”
“
Alright .   
That ’s almost a relief .   
Come on , ” Byron said .   
“
Let ’s get this creepy woman somewhere more secure .
”
“ Hardly a way to talk about me , ” Vista said .
“
Ha ha , ” Byron said .
“
We ’ll take her to the patrol block leaders , ” I said .   
“
See if that sways them any .
”
“ I can take over dragging it if you want , ” Vista said .
“
I ’m good ,
” Byron said .   
“ I like getting to pretend I ’m the one with enhanced strength .
”
“
What did you get , if he got that ?
” Vista asked .
“ Resistance to temperature extremes , ” Byron said .   
He grunted as he started dragging .   
“
There was a time I made ice .
”
“
Really .
”
“ Uh huh .   
There have been other things .
”
“
Can you change back ?   
Is that a thing you could do if you tried , or could you change to something new ?
”
“ I could , ” Byron said .   
“
But I do n’t want to go back , and I ’m worried about how I ’d get somewhere new .
”
“
I ’m happy
my power ’s simple , ” Vista said .
“
Gross distortion of dimensions , simple , ” I said .
She smiled and winked at me .
She was happy , it seemed .
I was-
I was almost happy too .
I had my concerns .   
I had plenty of worries about what was going to unfold as authorities decided to go after the Fallen or to let them go , and even the simpler joy of being a heroine had been tainted by Wretch and the horribleness of the people I ’d been dealing with .   
I could ask how everyone was doing , keep tabs on things , and help people out , and there was n’t anyone who was positioned or invested enough to do the same for me .
A reminder to myself that I needed to call that therapist .
But I could put it all aside , put it out of mind .
We had Mama Mathers .   
We had Operator and we had Cradle .   
It was a win , and a win we ’d thoroughly earned .
⊙ Son of a bitch , I should have known .
“
Why ?
” I asked .
“ We could n’t come to a decision , so we talked to the administrators who coordinate the patrol blocks , ”
Captain Marcial answered me .   
“
They said no .
”
“
We ’re leaving the remaining Fallen ?
” I asked .
“
We explained the guns , ” Gilpatrick said .   
“
The degree of violence here , the boundaries that were crossed .   
They ’ll have people on the lookout for violence , if the Fallen lash out or try something , but the sentiment expressed was that they did n’t want to punish others for getting away from a violent situation and standing down .
”
“
They ’re the Fallen , ” I said .   
“ They do n’t back down .
”
“ They do n’t back down , but they do get tired , ” Marcial said .   
“
We have problems today , occupying heroes and patrols .   
The Fallen are a problem for tomorrow .
”
“
That ’s the word from above , ” Gilpatrick said .
I retrieved my phone and checked the time .
According to Tattletale , the Fallen would get off the road in two hours and get into the Megalopolis again , somewhere on the east coast .   
They were obscuring their retreating convoy with powers , allegedly , and once they were in the city they ’d connect with others .   
Again , allegedly .
Two hours .
We ’d have to deal with Tattletale to know what location , or where they were if they did get to the city .    
We ’d have to achieve something of a win , and we ’d have to have a way to deal with the defeated Fallen .   
Here , we could put them on a bus in shackles , or dedicate whole teams to managing the powered ones .   
It helped that most of the powered had injuries that slowed them down .
It was n’t doable .
“
I ’m sorry ,
” Gilpatrick said .   
“
We mitigated the damage .   
We met most of the objectives , even in the face of much greater numbers than we expected .   
Today was a win .
”
“
That ’s not much consolation , ” Capricorn said .   
He was back to being Tristan .   
“
We were there in the thick of it .   
We saw them and talked to them .   
Lives are going to be lost if we let this go .   
They ’re pissed .   
They ’re heading into a population center .
”
“
Our resources are exhausted , ” Gaymon said .   
“ We have limited personnel and that personnel has been tied up for the better part of the day .   
If they go there and stop , we intend to let them .   
Otherwise , it ends up as one prolonged engagement where both sides get tired and sloppy .
”
“
This was already sloppy enough , ” Bash said .   
“ Unexpected numbers , the violence .
”
It was so maddening , that the desire for peace and a stop to conflict would provide the flammable material needed for the fires to spread .
I did n’t let that show on my face .
“
You ’re still standing , ” Capricorn said ,
“
There ’s gas in your vehicles .   
These people are unreasonable , dangerous and desperate .   
You ca n’t let this go .   
Others ca n’t afford for you to let it go .
”
I wished Narwhal was around .   
I wished Mayday would speak up .
I should n’t have been surprised .   
I ’d had an impression of Marcial almost right away , that she was n’t on our side .   
She ’d proven it .   
Gilpatrick-
I wanted to imagine he ’d tried and failed .   
In my time with the patrol block , I ’d seen decisions from oversight that had definitely been this dumb .
“
Thank you , ”
I said , as diplomatically as I could .   
“
I understand your hands are tied , if your bosses are saying no .
”
Capricorn ’s head snapped around .
“ They are , ” Marcial said .   
Had it come from anyone else , I might have been more inclined to believe it .
Capricorn was giving me a hard look through the eyeholes of his helmet .
“
There ’s no changing your mind , ” I said , for his benefit .   
“
We ’ll figure out what our course of action is in the next while .
”
“
It was a good collaboration .   
A good effort , even with everything that went wrong , ” Gilpatrick said .   
“ Be safe , take care of yourselves , and let me know if you need anything .
” I nodded .
I left the scene behind , feeling like I might have said something regrettable if I ’d stayed a moment longer .
“
This is where we part ways , I guess .   
We ’ll meet , talk , ” Vista said .   
“
You have my number .
” I nodded .   
I clasped her hand in mine .
“ Kick some ass , ” she said .
“
We ’ll see , ” I said .
We were a group as we walked away .   
Me , Capricorn , Sveta , Chris , Ashley , and Looksee had joined us , coming from New Haven to our powwow .
One more member to get .
We filed into the bus .   
Rain was awake , a phone that was n’t his in his lap .
“ Cradle ?
” he asked .








Rain had been slouched across the back seat , a first aid blanket over him , a phone there to give him something to occupy himself with .   
As he worked his way to a position where he sat upright , Tristan worked his way past the seats to offer a gentler hand .   
I would have offered help , more to help reduce the stress on Rain ’s body than because the strength was needed , but I was n’t able - bodied .
Not many of us were really up to the task , now that I noticed .   
Sveta was n’t weak but she was n’t coordinated .   
Ashley had her screwed up arm that was misfiring .   
Chris was able but not inclined .   
Kenzie was eleven .
As for Rain- the worst damage had been healed , physically , but he ’d come awfully close to dying .   
A serious impact in the next hour or two could phase out the healed body parts , with catastrophic consequences for both Rain and Scapegoat .   
When he moved , though , it was in a careful sort of way that went beyond someone reeling from physical injuries and going easy with the weird phased - in healing that Scapegoat did .   
We had to be ginger with the traumatized parts of him that were n’t physical .
I wanted to draw on my own experiences to empathize with him and better know what to do , but I did n’t have great experiences to draw on .   
I ’d been badly hurt before , but the only comparable kind of harm had been followed with convalescence and a kind of sedation .   
That had been followed by Amy ’s attentions and some erasure of memories .
A dark , heavy thought to go alongside
how drained I felt in the moment .
My best comparison was being made normal , on the eve of Gold Morning .   
A kind of trauma that was n’t physical , and that was definitely lasting .   
I could remember how I ’d been in those early days and weeks , ginger in how I handled everything , including myself .   
It had n’t helped that just about everyone had been reeling from the loss of Earth Bet , their homes , and loved ones .
“
You comfortable ?
” Capricorn asked .
“
As comfortable as I ’m going to be the next few days , ” Rain said .
“
Sorry that we ’re going to put more stuff on your plate so soon , ” I said .   
“
We ’re trying to figure out what we ’re doing .
”
“
I can take it , ” Rain said .   
“ I ’ve learned to deal with shit .
”
“
Thank you for swearing , ” Chris said .   
“ One of the most annoying things about being a hero is all the goody - goody types who refuse to swear around me .
”
“
Well , ” Rain said .   
He moved a bit , paused to wince , and then finished his sentence , “ I think it ’s firmly established that I ’m not a goody - goody type .   
I do want to help , though .
”
“
It ’s nice that they are n’t swearing , ” Kenzie said .   
“
They ’re thinking of us .
”
Chris scoffed audibly .   
With the seats of the bus being what they were , it was hard to see his face .
“
The worst part about being a hero is n’t anything about swearing , ” Ashley said .   
“
It ’s the untenable bureaucracy .
”
I saw Chris’ hand pop up to scratch his head .   
He said , “ You meant to say interminable or something , I think .
”
“
No , ” Ashley said .   
“
You meant to say yes , Damsel , you ’re right .
”
“
The bureaucracy is definitely a wall we ’ve run into , ”
I said , interrupting .   
“ The patrol does n’t want to pursue the remaining Fallen .
”
“
Who ?   
Do you know ?
”
“
The Fallen ?
” I asked .   
When he nodded , I followed up by outlining them .
“ Crowley brothers , their underlings .   
Bamet is out of action .   
The one who goes changer from a point in space is still out there , presumably .   
Valefor might be out there
but I made sure he wo n’t be able to give any orders for a while .   
We got Mama .
”
“
Oh wow , ” Rain said .
“
I told you before , but I do n’t think you were in a good state to process what I was saying , ” Sveta said .
Rain nodded slowly .   
“
You got Cradle .   
You got Mama .   
Snag ’s dead-
he ’s dead , right ?
”
“
He ’s very dead , ” Chris said .   
“ You should know .
”
“
It all feels like it might break away and reality might hit if I move too fast or look into it too much , ” Rain said .
I thought of the state I ’d been in , at the end of twenty - thirteen , the start of year zero , after Gold Morning .   
“
The way you described things , it ’s as if you ’re dreaming and things are less distinct than the very intense reality that came before the dream .
”
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .   
“
Exactly .
”
“ I get it , ” I said .   
“ I ’ve been there .   
You want to watch out for the moments where you ’re trying to reconcile the disconnect and make the now feel real again .   
It ’s easy to get carried away .
”
“
In a fight , you mean ?
” Capricorn asked .   
“ Throwing yourself at a situation to feel alive again ?
”
“ Not like that , exactly , ” I said .
“ I do n’t get it , ” Looksee said .
I floundered for a moment , then said , “ I guess , just as an example , I remember taking a shower and having a moment where it really woke me up and I felt grounded in reality again .   
There were a few days of painfully cold and hot showers , trying to wake up and stay fixed in the present .
”
Sveta reached over to touch my arm .
There had been other moments , too .   
Scrubbing myself until my skin broke , among other things .   
Too personal and raw to really share .
“ I ’ll watch out for that , ” Rain said .
“ I would really ,   really advise talking to Mrs. Yamada the next chance you get , ” I said , “ because I do n’t think it ’s the kind of thing you can watch out for on your own .
”
“ I left a message for her , ” he said .   
He touched the phone , which still sat in his lap .
Ashley ’s power flickered in the background .   
She adjusted her position , acting like nothing had happened as she leaned against the edge of one seat , a death grip around her forearm .
“
I ’m going to remove my helmet , ” Looksee said .   
“
My breath keeps fogging up the screen .
”
“
Keep your back to the windows , ” Tristan said .
“
Okay .
”
I was n’t sure it mattered-
the windows were in dire need of cleaning and dirt from the road covered them for extra measure .   
It was a good practice to be in , though , for our team members with secret identities .
There was some rummaging .   
Looksee was n’t the only one to adjust her stuff .   
We settled in for a longer talk , with Tristan removing his helmet .   
He set it down on the faux - leather bench of the bus beside him , then blurred , becoming Byron .
Byron , too , removed his helmet , setting it down next to Tristan ’s .   
Red and blue tinted metal , horns and ridges for the former , faint fins and distinct scales for the latter .
I pushed back my hood and pulled my gloves off , being more ginger with my left glove because of the injured arm it was attached to .   
I laid the gloves across my lap , and the metal decorations stabbed upward like a small crown .   
My hands were clammy .
“
The patrol does n’t want to go after the remaining Fallen ?
”
Rain finally spoke .   
His voice was as careful as his movements had been , with a questioning , almost unsure lilt at the end .
“
Tomorrow ’s problem , they think .   
There ’s enough to deal with today , ” I said .
“
That ’s the bad news , then ?
”
Rain asked .   
“
Good news is we got some of the worst of them , the bad news is the Crowleys are going to riot ?
”
“
That ’s the gist of it , ” Byron said .   
His reserved tone of voice was a good match for the quieter - than - usual Rain .
“
You ’re the resident expert , Rain , ” I said .   
“
How do the Crowleys react ?
”
“
Oof , ” Rain huffed out the word .   
“
I know them mostly from visits and once a year events .   
We ’d sometimes get people sent to us from their family , trading people between families , to cement ties .   
I was one of those people , once .
”
Sveta spoke up , “ Tattletale wants Cradle in exchange for helping us stop them .   
The patrol is n’t helping , so …
”
“
So it ’s not even guaranteed we can make this work , ” I finished the trailing sentence .
“ Wants Cradle
how ?
” Rain asked .
“ To go free , ” Sveta said .   
“
The patrol is holding him and the assassin- ” “
They ’re annoyed about it , ” Chris added .
“ -And we wanted to ask for your input , ” Sveta finished her statement .
Rain leaned back , his head lolling back until it rested on the top edge of the bench seat .   
He sighed .
“
I thought I only had Love Lost to worry about now , ” he said .   
“ You want to let him go ?
”
“ I do n’t , ” Kenzie said .   
“ I want you to be safe .
”
“ We ’re unsure .   
Trying to figure it out , ” Sveta said .   
“
It ’s why we ’re asking about the Crowleys .
”
“
Where were you originally ?
” I asked .   
I put the question out there in part to not make this too abrupt or intense for Rain .   
“ Were you Crowley ?
”
“ McVeay , kind of .   
My aunt and uncle were more into it than my parents , I think .   
We had irregular visits to or- or by some intense , religious people that everyone listened to .   
A lot changed as we moved around , sometimes we camped , sometimes it was trailers , but a few things were constant , like religious services , extended family being there , and those intense , scary people .   
Then I was sent to the Mathers , along with my aunt and uncle .   
A bunch of the original people I know from childhood were already there- or here .   
Are still here .
”
“
The community part of it sounds nice , at least , ” Kenzie offered .
“
It really was n’t , ” Rain said .
“
Oh .
”
“
Sorry , ” he said .   
He sighed .   
“
Crowleys … we ’ve been seeing them like I used to see the McVeay leaders when we ’d go visit their compounds or when they checked on us .   
The rest of the family never respected them .   
That branch started because some university kids wanted attention , and then a bunch of brothers with powers jumped in , played along , and took over .   
They almost got killed by the other families before they figured out how to play the politics .
”
“
And somewhere along the way , they started buying what they were selling to keep the group together ?
” I asked .
Rain shook his head .   
“ I do n’t know .   
It never felt like they took this seriously , everyone says they capitalize on the reputation of the other families .   
But they had the guns today , did n’t they ?   
They were for real .
”
“
Yeah , ” Byron said .
“ You do n’t have a good sense of them , then ?
” I asked .
“ I have a bit of a sense .   
The low level guys , there are some that call themselves jackasses .   
It ’s a badge of honor .   
They vandalize , they do the stunts you might hear about on the news , interrupting serious events , getting people offended .
”
“
The people most people think about when they think of Fallen , ” Byron said .
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .   
“
Thing is , when we ’d all get together so every family had enough people nearby to be an army in case something happened , we ’d see the jackasses and they ’d be some of the scariest people around .
”
Chris leaned forward , “ Stay away from those Jackass kids , Junior , they ’re up to no good , I hear one of them was crazy enough to trim his pubes with a weed whacker .   
Be back before eight , because we ’re decapitating a baby for the ritual tonight and we need you to hold it down .
”
“ Not the baby , ” Kenzie gasped .
“
That first part is n’t all that wrong , ” Rain said .   
“
We ’d laugh about it , because parents would tell soldiers to stay away from these loons that have probably never seen a fight .
”
“
They ’re all loons , ” Kenzie said .
“
Well , yeah ,
” Rain said .   
“
These guys specifically were … not all super nuts .   
Some were like you or me .
”
“ You and me are pretty screwed up , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I do n’t think that ’s a good measure .
”
“ I think it ’s right .   
The minor ones were almost normal , except for the part where they were Fallen and they ’d each done something to earn their stripes , like playing death metal over speakers at a remembrance ceremony .   
But there are a lot of them who …
I guess spent years getting celebrated for doing fucked up things .   
No empathy , no fear of death .   
Those are the ones to watch out for , and the ones I can definitely see hurting civilians .   
Shooting people .   
Shit .
”
“
Those are the little guys .   
What about the leaders ?
” I asked .   
“ If they can order their guys around , what are they going to tell them ?
”
“ I do n’t know .   
I never really learned much about them specifically .   
I saw a few of their immediate family members .
They thrive on being unpredictable , I guess .   
They seemed to go back and forth between a ton of infighting and hurting themselves and then suddenly being really good manipulators who would send relatives to other branches and isolated cells and try to get them to collaborate on something or they ’d steer that ship .
”
“ If the patrol knows they ’re that hard to figure out , they could be taking a wait and see approach , ” Sveta said .   
She looked at me .
“
The patrol is overlooking that we have some pretty good ideas about their current direction , with them using the guns like they did , ” I pointed out .
“ People are going to get hurt if someone does n’t stop them , ” Rain murmured .
“ You think ?
” Byron asked .
“
Oh yeah ,
” Rain said .   
“
Yeah .
” I started to lean forward , because the backs of the bus seats obscured so much of the group , found I could n’t comfortably do it without my arm hurting , and sat up straighter instead .
“ We wanted to prevent this .   
A spy in Advance-
”
A noise at the front of the bus interrupted me .   
The door was being pushed open .   
Kenzie and Byron reached for their helmets .   
Kenzie held the front half of her helmet up in front of her face with her hands .
They relaxed when the head popped up .   
Black haired , with jewelry .
“ I ’m sorry to interrupt , ” Erin said .   
“ I can go .
”
“
Stay , ” Rain said .
Erin remained where she was .   
From the height she stood at , she had to be standing on the stair of the bus just before the level the driver ’s chair was situated on .   
The flat barrier with the railing separated her from us .
“
You ’re okay now , ” she said .   
“
I saw you before , briefly , while you were bloody-
I should n’t be mentioning that .
”
She sounded so shaken .
“
Do you guys want to be alone ?
” Sveta asked .
“
Sure , ” Rain said , at the same time Erin said , “ No .
”
The tension in the pause that followed was almost physical .
“
Is your family
okay ?
”
Rain asked .
“ Mom was really upset .   
She got angry , and tried to pick a fight with someone our age , one of the people in body armor .   
I was just talking with her , while she ’s handcuffed to a rail in one of the buses now .   
Dad-
he ’s angry too
but he ’s holding it together
so he can stick with Bryce .
”
“
I ’m glad they ’re alive , ” Rain said .
“ They ’re shaken .   
When we were mind controlled , it shook them .   
There was a moment I was talking to my mom when she asked me for an explanation , and I thought- did she get it ?   
Then she started making up these really thin reasons and getting really angry at me for no reason , when I was n’t saying anything .
”
Erin looked so disappointed .
She went on , and her eyes were damp as she said , “
But I ’m glad they ’re alive too , Rain .   
You gave me something I did n’t think was possible .   
They ’re away from all of that .   
Maybe there ’s a chance .
”
“ I hope so , ” Rain said .
“
I ’m
sorry
I was so horrible to you , ” she said .
“
That night was the kind of night that ’s horrible no matter what , ” Rain said .   
“ Was n’t you .   
Let ’s pretend it never happened .
”
“ I ’d like that , ” she said .   
“
Can we go back to being friends ?
”
“ Friends , ” Rain said .   
“
Yeah , of course .   
Come sit ?   
Keep us company ?   
These guys are going to leave soon , and I ’ll be bored like this .
”
“ I- ” she started .   
“
Bryce did get a little bit hurt .   
I was about to check up on him .   
I ’ll visit properly later .
”
“
Okay .
”   
The one word from Rain sounded anything but .
“
You guys do your hero thing , ” she spoke with a forced brightness .   
“
Thank you , everyone .   
I know you helped .   
You ’re amazing .
”
“ Except for Kenzie , ” Chris said .   
“
She ’s just okay .
”
“ Aw .
”
“
Do n’t listen to him .   
You ’re especially amazing , critter , ” Erin said .   
“ Second only to Rain , and I ’m biased .
” I snuck a glance at Rain , trying to read him .
“
Do your hero thing , Rain , ” Erin said .   
“ Because-
you are a hero .   
Thank you for helping to get us out .
”
“
Say hi to Bryce for me , yeah ?
”
Rain asked .
“ I will .   
I ’ll visit soon , ” she said .   
“ I promise .
”
And then she was gone , ducking her head down , exiting the bus .   
I twisted around and watched through the blurry , dusty window as she walked away , escorted by a patrol student in uniform .
When I looked back in Rain ’s direction , his eyes were moist and getting moister .
I dropped my gaze , my eyes settled on the ‘ crown’ of spikes from my gloves .   
Each spike was meant to run over the top of my knuckles and rest flat against the back of my hand , all in parallel .   
I rested a finger on one of the longer spikes .
Rain could n’t be faulted for feeling vulnerable after his ordeal .
“ Cradle would hurt them to get at me , ” Rain said .
“
It ’s possible , ” I said .   
I was put in mind of Cradle
’s words , and the way his description of Rain had struck home for me .   
Had I been willing to look at Rain , I might have found it hard to maintain eye contact .
“
That ’s not what I thought you ’d say , ” Sveta said .   
Her eyes , like mine , were downcast .
“ You want me to let him go , ” Rain said .
“
I ’m in this to help people , ” Sveta said .   
“
I think we should all want this .   
Even if any of you are more selfish than that , think about where the team is .
”
“
Where ’s the team ?
” Kenzie asked .
Sveta met my eyes .   
I glanced at Ashley , in turn , then at Byron .
“ Kenzie , Ashley kind of killed someone , ” Sveta said .   
“
So did Rain .
”
“ You came very close to killing someone too , ” I said .
“ I had to , ” Kenzie said .
“
Wait , let me talk , ” Sveta said .   
“
I ’ve been thinking about this .   
I talked about this in front of all of you at different times .   
In the group , and in the room with Victoria .   
My first clear memories , I was dropped into the middle of a populated area in Russia .   
I killed a lot of people accidentally .   
Civilians and army that came after me , and then people from the PRT .   
I did n’t stop because I found a way to stop .   
I stopped because they caught me .
”
“
You ’ve talked about it , ” Ashley said .   
“
Deaths stay with us .
”
“
They ’re supposed to stay with us !
”
Sveta sounded plaintive and outraged at the same time .   
“
This is major .   
I got each and every one of those names of the people I killed .   
I learned about them .   
I know
it was n’t my fault , but … ”
“ Saving those people would n’t mitigate that , ” Ashley said .   
“ There are n’t scales that balance because you take one life and save another .   
If you take lives you ’re a murderer and nothing wipes that slate clean .
”
“
That ’s not true , ” Kenzie said .
“
I know that , Ashley , ” Sveta said , upset ,
“
That ’s not what I ’m saying at all .
”
“ What are you saying ?
” I asked .
“ I think it would be really messed up if the deaths were glossed over because things were as bad as they were , ” Sveta said .   
“
And if the team stayed together .   
I do n’t see a good way for things to end .
”
“
End ?
” Kenzie asked .   
“
There does n’t have to be an end .
”
“ Kenzie , ” Sveta sounded apologetic as she said it .   
“
How does this continue ?
”
“ It continues when you accept that the people who died were …
” Chris said , trailing off .
“ Monstrous ?
” Sveta asked , archly .
“ Assholes , ” Chris said .
“
Yeah .   
Let ’s kill every asshole , ” Sveta said .   
“
That ’d be great .   
We ’re supposed to be a hero team .   
I would n’t feel very heroic if this was how we left this .
”
“ We do n’t have to leave anything , ” Kenzie said .   
Sveta moved her hand to reach over the top of the seat and touch Kenzie ’s shoulder , and Kenzie pushed it away .   
“
This is silly .
”
“
An awful lot of us have killed , ” Rain said .   
“
Consequences pending or interrupted .
”
“
You said , once , that you wanted to turn yourself in , ” Sveta said .   
“
You were n’t clear about what happened around that , but it led to your joining the group .
”
“ Time with Mrs. Yamada first , then the group , ” he said .   
“
I heard some of that discussion .
”
“ Mama Mathers kept you from confessing , ” I concluded .
“
Yes , ” he replied .   
“
I ’ve always told myself that I ’d face consequences for what I did .   
There ’s no room in the jails , yet .   
But maybe one day I ’ll face a sentence .   
A lot of people got hurt because I did n’t act .   
Maybe ten , twenty years , with time off because I cooperate .   
That does n’t wipe the slate clean , like Ashley said , does it ?   
But maybe it helps ?
”
“
Ashley-
you ’re cooperating , are n’t you ?
” Sveta asked .
“
Yes .
”
“
No , ” Kenzie said .
“ I think it would be a relief , ” Ashley said .   
“ Incarceration .   
I ’ve been waiting a long time for it
, I think , and there are people waiting for me on the other side .
”
“ I do n’t want to be the bad guy .   
I just want due process , ” Sveta said .   
“
That ’s all .
”
“
How does this relate to going after the Fallen ?
” I asked .
“ I do n’t want this to be all regrets , ” she said .   
“
You ’re certain
this is going to turn violent , Rain ?
”
“ Completely , ” he said .   
“
It ’s the mindset .   
The Crowleys are a bit of a mystery but Fallen as a group are n’t .
”
“
Then let ’s get people to help , ” Sveta said .   
“
The patrol might not help , the Undersiders might refuse if we do n’t give them Cradle , but we made other allies .   
If this is an emergency then let ’s call in favors and do what we can .
”
“ Without getting involved , ” Byron said .
“
Yeah , ” Sveta said .   
“ Not us as a group .   
We ’d be peripheral , coordinating .   
We all know people .   
We can do the right thing here , all of us working together .   
That ’s what I want most- for this to have been a good thing .
”
“
You say that like it ’s already over , ” Kenzie said .
“
This part of it ’s almost over , ” Ashley said .
“
No , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Nuh uh .
”
“ Does not compute with K - z logic , ” Chris said .
“ Fuck off , Chris , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Dickhole .
”
She grabbed her helmet as she stood up , putting it on as the two halves .   
She stopped walking as I put a hand out .
“
Let me go , ” she said .
“ I will .   
One question though , ” I said .
“
What ?
”
“ Are you going to regret not being here for this conversation ?   
I can fill you in after , if you need to get away , or I could come with you , if you needed company or backup .
”
“
You agree with Sveta , do n’t you ?
”
she asked , accusatory .
“
I like the idea of due process and fair justice , ” I said .   
“
I ’m not as sure as Sveta that this machine has its cogs in place .
”
She stood there .   
Even with the parts of her bodysuit that stood out to give it definition and decoration , it was very apparent how small and skinny she was .   
A couple of inches shy of being five feet tall .   
Fragile , in a completely different way than Rain was fragile , right now .
She pushed past my hand , walked down the aisle a bit , and then seated herself on a seat a few rows behind Ashley , her back to us .
“
Outlining our options , Tattletale said she ’d keep an eye on Cradle , ” I said .
“
She says a lot of things , ” Chris said .   
“
I ’m a bit lost , in all of this .   
But she pointed Cradle and the cleaver assassin at Rain , right ?   
She led them right to him .
”
“
It looks like it , ” Sveta said .
“
Then she pointed us at the assassin guy and Cradle .
”
“
Yeah , ” Sveta said .
“
And now she wants us to let Cradle go .
”
“
Yes , ” I said .
“
Contradictory , ” Chris said .
“
She promised an explanation , ” I said .
“
Damn this fragile healing effect , ” Rain said .   
He sounded angrier than anything , now .   
“
I really want that explanation , now , to my face .
”
“
I can help with that , ” Kenzie said , from halfway down the bus , her back still to us .
I looked at Rain , and then I looked at the boy who had forecast so much of this .   
Tristan might have been the type for a victorious ‘ I told you so’ , had the roles been reversed .   
Byron , however , was quiet , his expression unreadable .
My hand moved , and the ‘ crown’ moved with it .   
I ’d exerted too much pressure , and the point of the spike had pierced the bed of my finger , with red blood welling up and a droplet tracing its way down the spike .
I donned the glove , the fabric serving to cover the small puncture wound .
⊙ I ’d met with Tattletale before , in a place very similar to this .   
The city was close to one of the portals , and it was very likely that it was one of the cities that had been supplied with foreign material , and that material was concrete .   
Underfoot , the buildings , the supporting pillars that ran diagonally from the ground to the buildings .
Yellow paint marked the pillars , so cars would n’t drive into gray pillars against a backdrop of gray ground and gray buildings .   
More of the paint had been used to define the boundaries of the road .   
Perhaps because the yellow paint was so prevalent , some enterprising vandals had used a boatload of it to scrawl crude images and words along many surfaces- only some of which had been cleaned or partially cleaned .   
I suspected the cleanup crews were high school students working as part of a morning or afternoon block , because there seemed to be a bias in the graffiti that was partially removed versus the images that had n’t been touched .   
Art was allowed to stay up as long as possible .
Again , I was guided to a food court , this one beside a complicated concrete edifice with extraneous pillars and supports , and a long overhang that kept things dry in the light rain .   
Again , the graffiti , I noted .   
Maybe it was something Tattletale liked or identified with the Undersiders .
This time , though , I was n’t arriving alone .
It was an odd feeling , to have the team with me , when things stood where they did .   
Minus two members , but most of us were present .   
Yes , things were tense and uneasy , but there had been a moment back there where I ’d been damn proud of all of them .   
Against Cradle in particular , we ’d stood together .
Once we ’d figured out where we were going , deciding on a route that avoided the settled areas and roads , Vista had shortened the distance as much as she could .   
We ’d left Kenzie
’s projector cube behind , in favor of the faster trip .   
Even with the shortcut , we ’d had to hitch a ride to get ourselves here .   
Concord Station .
The Undersiders were waiting for us .   
They sat on tables and chairs , or lounged with stuffed animals and mutant dogs giving them something to lean on or sit on .   
Foil and Imp stood , while others sat or leaned back .   
Foil was stock still , on guard , and Imp was restless .
There were others .   
I recognized Snuff .   
There was the boy with the birds .   
Two people were dressed to match Rachel in general style , with heavy clothes that seemed more utilitarian , except for bits and pieces , like a collar here or a spiked belt wrapped around the arm there .   
The guy wore a bear trap decoration around his lower face .
Maybe those were utilitarian too , with ‘ intimidation’ being the sought - after utility .
They would have outnumbered us without the mutant dogs and the giant stuffed animals with the black cloth .   
With them , though ?   
Three to one .
Similar to Snag ’s numbers , now that I thought about it .
“
The Fallen reached the city a bit ago , ” Tattletale said .   
“
They did n’t go in with guns blazing , but they ’re liable to come out that way .
”
“ I see your team made it out intact , ” I observed .   
Off to my left , Chris walked away , traveling the perimeter of the area where the overhang kept the rain off .   
Foil changed position , ready to take a shot with her crossbow if she had to , and one of the dogs that had been lying down stood up .
“ We get by , ” Tattletale said .   
“
We were playing it careful , we even tried to warn Prancer that something was wrong .   
He did n’t buy it .   
That ’s the issue you run into when you surround yourself with villains and deceivers .   
You ca n’t be sure they ’re for real when they tell you something important .
”
“
Is it isolating , Tattletale , sitting there surrounded with your deceivers and villains ?
” I asked .
“
No .   
I ’m
pretty content
right now , actually .
”
“
Weld says hi , Foil , ” Sveta said .   
“
He wishes he could have talked with you while you were there .
”
Foil nodded , but she remained silent .
“
This is kind of a favor , us stopping while we ’re partway home , waiting for you , giving you the deets you ’re so eager for .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
I really do appreciate this .   
I know
it ’s a really difficult thing , acting halfway decent .   
Do make sure you keep pointing it out , any time you do it , and gloss over the parts where there ’s tacit manipulation or something in it for you .
”
Tristan leaned over and murmured , “
Are you sure you ’re good
taking point on this ?
”
“
Yeah , ” I murmured back .
“
She and I , we have a rapport , Capricorn , ” Tattletale said .   
“
It ’s not a healthy rapport , but we are who we are .   
Oil and water .
”
“
Can we be the oil ?
”
Imp asked .   
“
Slick , dark , with wealth implied ?
”
Beside me , Looksee had her camera .   
She hefted it up and set it down on the table .
“
No recordings , please , ” Tattletale said .   
“ Or
this conversation is over .
”
“
It ’s not a recording , ” Looksee said .
“
Strange tinker devices ?   
Not a great way to open this discussion , ” Tattletale said .   
“
At least it ’s interesting .   
I thought this would be the usual predictable thing with you sniping at me and then asking the questions .   
Why did I help you , why did I help Cradle , what are the Fallen doing , what are you missing ?
”
“
No , ” I said .
“ If you ’re not giving me Cradle , this is going to be a short meeting , ” she said .
“ Explanations before we give you anything , ” I said .
“
And we ’re back to the script , ” Tattletale sighed the words , barely audible .   
“
Normally people pay me for my information .   
But for you , and for hometown pride …
”
“
Not me , ”
I said .   
“
The explanations are n’t for me .
”
I looked at Kenzie .
She hit a button on her camera .   
When it did n’t boot , she hammered it with her hand a few times .
The projector came on .   
The two missing members of our group appeared .   
Ashley was projected , her lower body a static black dress .   
She ’d be sitting on a bus right now , a laptop beside her , to capture her face and anything she said .
And Rain .   
For the moment , he was intact , but frozen in place .
“
Ah , ” Tattletale said .   
“
Your Fallen teammate .
”
“
It ’s up to him whether we give you Cradle or not , ” I said .   
“
But we ’re leaning toward not , just so you know .
”
“ Of course .   
Standard negotiation .
”
Looksee hit the camera again .
Rain animated , the image glitching in the moment before it caught up .   
Now he appeared like he was in the plaza with us , the occasional scan line or glitch marking him for the projected image he was .
Looksee ’s camera had captured the images of the wounds .   
The slashes , the cuts and cleaves , and the parts where skin peeled away .   
It simulated the blood .
She ’d even captured the background sound .   
The ragged , rough breathing , like each inhalation and exhalation was an effort .
“ I do n’t need to ask you why you helped both Cradle and us , ” I said .   
“
I think I get it .
”
“
Do you now ?
”
Tattletale asked .   
Her attention was on Rain ’s spectre .   
Damsel ’s spectre moved around the group , standing beside Looksee .
“ I get it because you want the same thing I want .   
You were managing the battle and hoping and praying that people would see the light and play nice .   
You want the old rules and the old ‘ game’ , and you ’re apparently not that stellar when it comes to reading multi - triggers like my teammate , Cradle , or March .   
You underestimated the bloodlust and you overestimated how much my teammate deserved it .   
He got the cleaver , and you felt so darn awful about it , you volunteered help .
”
“
Oh my god , Tattletale , ” Parian said .
“
There ’s a good bit more to it , ” Tattletale said , before turning to tell Parian , “ so do n’t buy too heavily into the theatrics .   
We ’re capes .   
We should be used to this .
”
“ If you want to deal with people like Cradle , you should at least look at the consequences , ” Sveta said .
“
I ’m aware of the consequences .   
I ’m aware of a ton of stuff .   
The reality is , Garotte , there ’s bigger picture stuff .   
There ’re a half - dozen people who are only seeing one or two dimensions of the greater structure and we ’re each trying to keep it from toppling without being able to talk to the others .   
I ’m trying to hold up my end and simultaneously open the channels of communication .   
Kind of important .
”
So she said , but she did n’t like looking at Rain as she said it .
I could work with that .   
Maybe I would n’t take point on this after all .   
I felt a grim kind of satisfaction .
“
Great , ” I said .   
“ Elaborate .   
But do n’t tell me .   
Tell him . ”








“ Snuff ?
”
Tattletale asked .   
She glanced back at the hooded brute .   
“
Can you take Chicken Little for a walk ?
”
“ Can do , ” the man in the hood said .
“ Chicken Little ?
” I asked .
“
That ’s a good name , ” Looksee said .   
“
The sky is falling , the sky is falling !
”
I could hear Chris sigh .
“ I make it fall , ” the boy with the birds said .   
His voice was small and far away .   
On a rooftop to our left , birds took off , flying through the light rain .
“
Perfect , ” Looksee said , giving him a thumbs up .
Chris sighed again .
The birds swooped down to settle at the foot of one of the blocky , concrete office buildings .
“ Bye , ” Chicken Little said .
“ Bye , ” Looksee said .
The birds took off , flying over and ahead of the kid .
The fact that everyone was waiting for the hooded executioner to lead the kid villain away gave me a chance to observe and think-
he was n’t good at projecting his voice .   
His frame was more similar to Kenzie , but he slouched some like Chris did .   
Chris , though , had a natural volume , possibly because of subtle changer effects .   
I felt an urge to coach him , and correct something that seemed so obvious , which might have been why I was fixated on it .
It was disconcerting to picture my giving him some tips , having him standing up straighter , having him put his hands in his back pockets as an example of how far back his shoulders should be , and having him speak .   
My mom had done it with me , once upon a time .
Rain pattered down beyond the lip of shelter that extended out over our portion of the plaza .   
The sound of pained breathing wheezed in and out in the background .
“ Chicken Little , ” I said , again .
“
I was pushing for Hitchcock , ” Tattletale said .   
“
Cardinal was good too , but taken .
”
“ I was pushing for Unkindness , ” Imp added .   
“
It went over everyone ’s heads .
”
“
Then it ’s not a good cape name , ” I said .   
“
It ’s going over my head .
”
“ High bar , ” Imp retorted .
“ I was a pretty good student , actually , ” I said .
“ Were you , though ?   
I was a terrible student
and I got it .
”
“
An unkindness of ravens , ” Ashley said .   
Her voice came from Looksee ’s camera , rather than from the projection .
“
Thank you !
”
Imp said .
“
It ’s not very good , ” Ashley said .
“ Ugh ! ”
“
He controls a swarm of birds ?
” I asked .   
I arched an eyebrow .
“
It reminded me of a friend , believe it or not .   
He needed a mentor , and it seemed natural .
”
“ Naturally , ” I said .
“ Trying to do right by him , ” Tattletale said , “ Letting him pick his own name , which you should never let a pre - teen do- ”
“
Ahem , ” Looksee said .
“
Damn straight , ” Chris said .
“
-Teaching him what he needs to know to get by as a cape in this crazy world of ours , and , you know , not making him stand there while you parade around a projection of a horribly maimed teenager .   
The little things .
”
“
I ’m his age
and I put that projection together , you know , ” Looksee said .   
“ I had to look really closely at the images I was rendering .   
This is good work !
”
“ You appear to have mentors who are fine with exposing you to that kind of thing , Looksee , ” Tattletale ’s reply was as smooth as anything .
“
Maybe I ’m a badass , ” Looksee said .   
“
I took out Mama Mathers .
”
“
Speaking of , ” Tattletale said , perking up and looking past Looksee to Capricorn .   
“
She ’s dead ?   
No .   
Contained ?
”
“
She ’s contained with physical constraints and some power stuff , ” Capricorn said .
“ Partially phased into another reality , ” Rain clarified .   
“
I talked to the heroes .   
She ’s kept an eye on the Crowley clan for years
, twenty - four seven .   
She might not sleep .
”
“ Tranquilizers do n’t work , she ’ll fake it , ” Tattletale said .   
“
You figured that out .   
Good .   
Phasing her out should break the connection as long as it lasts , if it can be maintained .   
It might even force her to reset all the connections .
”
“
That was the line of thinking , ” I said .
Rain spoke up , taking advantage of the fact he ’d had an opening in the conversation again , “ I ’d really like to hear how you can know how she works , know how she keeps people under her thumb , and then sign off on hurting the innocents caught in the mix .   
Doing this to me .
”
“ I ’d like to hear that too , Tattletale , ” Foil said .
“ Please , ” Parian said .
“ Please , ” I said , echoing Parian ’s word , but in my brightest , nicest tone of voice .   
I smiled at Tattletale .
Tattletale fixed me with her best ‘ are you serious’ look .
“
You said you ’d help Cradle , but you did n’t want to know what happened to the kid , ” I said .   
“
We thought you needed to see the consequences of your actions .
”
“
That is pretty ripe , coming from the princess of damage and her troupe of walking disaster areas , ” Tattletale said .   
“
I have looked you guys up , read files , you know .
”
“ Deflecting ?
” Tristan asked .
“
A bit ,
yeah .   
But I think it ’s important for context , because you guys do n’t get to act high and mighty here .   
The Fallen kid locked people inside a mall and let them die from trampling , fire and smoke .   
The junior half of Team Reach crashed and burned after you got up to your antics , Capricorn .   
Damsel of Distress had an invite to the Slaughterhouse Nine .
”
“
So did I , ” Rachel said .
“ Shh , ” Tattletale said .
“
Are you saying you ’d do the same for any of us ?
” I asked .
“
I ’m saying you guys are really not the ones who should be throwing stones here .   
I know how you got together , even if I do n’t have all the individual details .   
The institution that looks after Creepy Kid barely sees him and
they ’re scared enough of him when he ’s there to let him do what he wants .   
There ’s a story there .
”
Something to look into , then .
Tattletale went on , “ Garotte , honey , you had my team ’s back at the Cauldron HQ .   
I do n’t want to sling mud at you , but anyone who knows you knows you ’re dangerous and you ’ve hurt a lot of people .
”
“
Anyone who knows her would n’t fault her for it , ” I said .   
“
I can fault you for knowing full well what you were setting in motion .
” Sveta spoke , “ I have never , not once , wanted anyone to die , ” Sveta said , her voice firm , even tight .
“
You and I both know that ’s a lie , ” Tattletale said .
“ Death happened , ” Sveta said .   
She was glowering .   
“ If I ’d had the choice , I would have spared even her .   
My body was wounded , I was as freaked out as I ’ve ever been , and someone needed to die .   
I ’ve made peace with the fact that I was able to make that someone be her .
”
“
Convenient , ”
Tattletale ’s word was barely audible .
“ Honey , ” Sveta replied , and the word was only venom .   
“
Do n’t say you do n’t want to sling mud at me and then go for the jugular .   
We ’re not stupid .   
If you ’re going to be vicious with someone who has saved the lives of several people here , do n’t coat it in that ‘ honey’ .
”
“
Throwing everything you ’ve got at the wall and seeing what sticks , Tattletale ?
” I asked .   
“ Desperate .
”
“
I ’m tired , ” Tattletale said .
“
You skipped me , by the way , ” Looksee said .
“ I skipped you because you ’re prepubescent
and I ’m not
that big of a bitch .
”
“ I can take it .   
I do n’t want special treatment .
”
“
I ’m tired , Victoria , ” Tattletale said .   
“
I ’ve spent two years trying to do my part to keep the world standing upright .   
Parian , Foil , Imp , Rachel , you guys know the kind of thing I ’ve been doing .
”
“ Ignoring me is bitchier than whatever you were going to say , ” Looksee said .
“
What if I told you there was nothing ?
”
Tattletale asked , exasperated .
“
I ’d say you were being condescending , which is super bitchy .
”
“ Kiddo , you fucking raised the bar by not only blazing an accelerant - soaked trail of destruction through your cape life , but your civilian life too .   
You did more damage casually than some do intentionally .   
There ’s a reason I ignored your calls .   
You proved me right when you bricked my good phone with the incessant attempts to get my attention .
”
“ Can confirm , ” Imp remarked .   
“ Tats went mute mid - mission while she scrambled to get a new phone .   
She was pissed .   
It was great .
”
Looksee paused , digesting that , then answered Tattletale at a lower volume than before .
“
I automated it , so you know .
”
“ I figured .   
Point stands .
”
“
It ’ll unbrick if you reply to one of the messages .   
That was the point , if you read any of the warnings or the last message sent .
”
Tattletale shook her head .   
“
Where was I ?
”
“
You ’re tired , so you took a shortcut by striking a deal with a guy who was really good with blades and the guy who really wanted me cut up , ” Rain said .
I glanced at the Undersiders .   
They were n’t moving much .   
Foil was bending down
so Parian could whisper something in her ear .   
Both of them were fixing their eyes on Tattletale , even while Parian whispered .
“ Not a shortcut , ” Tattletale said .
“
He knew where to place the blades for maximum effect , drawing it out , ” Rain said .   
His fingers touched one of the wounds .   
“
That ’s why they hired him , you know .
”
“
It was n’t a shortcut , and it was never intended that they ’d go through with it , ” Tattletale said .   
“ So please , off the high horses , stop crawling up my ass , and I ’ll explain .
”
“
That you made a mistake , ” I said .
“
Oh my god , ” she said .   
“
If they did n’t hire me , they would have hired someone else .   
The benefit of them hiring me ?   
I had every intention of steering them away .   
I offered Cradle something he wanted more than revenge , last minute , after I ’d proven I could deliver what he wanted .   
Well , it was n’t last minute .   
Last thirty seconds , because I had to take thirty to put my card in a new phone to repopen communication after someone bricked my good phone .
”
Tattletale frowned at Looksee as she said that last part .
“
A mistake , then , ” I said .   
“
You were tired and you made a mistake , is what you ’re saying .
”
“
Someone else got to Cradle in the meantime , I think .   
If we had this conversation in five days , I could give you a definitive answer .   
For now , best I can do for explanations ?   
I figured it out and someone steered him onto a more determined course .   
I did n’t make a mistake , and
no , grab bags are n’t some inexplicable thing for me .   
I was n’t shooting blind , thank you very much .
”
“
Are you saying that because you ’re for real or because you ’re trying to cover your weaknesses ?
”
“ Gee , Victoria , ” Tattletale said .   
“
I could hardly be blamed if it was me covering my ass .   
The last time I gave you a hint about the strengths and weaknesses of my power , you went full offensive with this bit of theatrics .   
But no .   
March was and is an isolated , special case .
”
“
In so many ways , ” Foil murmured .
“ Theatrics are one of the best part of being a cape , ” I said .
“ One of them , ” Capricorn said .
“
Okay , ” she said .   
“
But you ’re wrong
that I ’m covering my ass .   
No , sorry .
”
I was right that Rain had her agitated though .
“
What was the plan ?
”
Rain asked .
“ Had all gone as intended , you would have walked away .   
A lot depended on whether your three fellow grab - bags were there together , or which one or two were there , but there was no way I could make the offer earlier .
”
“ Why not ?
” I asked .
“
How do you think that would go , Victoria ?   
Hey , guys , I ’ll give you this thing if you promise not to go after this member of the Fallen
you have really good justification for hating .   
For no reason , I promise , I ’m totally not on his side .   
Come on .   
They do have some humanity .   
For Snag , a few choice words at the moment he was about to pull the metaphorical trigger , as that tiny part of him screamed that it did n’t want to do it ?   
Would ’ve worked .
”
“ Love Lost ?
”
Rain asked .
“
Angrier .   
Hurting more .   
You would have needed to bleed first , but it would n’t have been nearly as bad .   
It ’s why I told Cradle that if he and Operator went after you , she should n’t be there .   
She would have been too hard to hold back , and what I told him was that she would have snapped and killed you in a very unsatisfyingly quick way .   
I could have steered her away with the right words , right timing , but I did n’t want to gamble it .   
Cradle is pragmatic .   
He got it .   
She was n’t invited along .
”
“ And Cradle ?   
He was there and you could n’t stop him .
”
“
Like I said , I needed to prove I could deliver , to maintain the professional relationship , but I did n’t have to deliver if I could make a better offer .   
I think someone beat me to it , offering him something .
”
“
Who ?   
What were they offering ?   
What were you ?
”
“
I do n’t know who or what .   
They exist in hypothetical .   
As for me , I was offering a way out .
”
“ A way out , ” Rain said .   
“
Of the- the rotation .
”
“
There ’s a cape by the name of Goddess .   
Also the Blue Empress , Blue Lady , the Woman in Blue .   
Once situated on Earth Shin , she was brought here for the fight against Scion by a strange , unnamed player who has since been classified as a threat on par with any Endbringer .   
Or with Goddess , as it happens .   
Unfortunately , this anonymous figure did n’t put her back .
”
“ A strange , unnamed player ?
” I asked .
“
So it happens , ” Tattletale said , with a grin .   
“
With only a select group of top Wardens and major players really tracking what really happened .   
But we were talking the woman in blue .   
She got powers and was relocated to Earth Shin before she could … grow to full potential .   
Relocated by a certain secretive agency .
”
“ Cauldron , ” Sveta said .
“ Yep .   
She proceeded to take over earth Shin , with all other parahumans acting as her lieutenants .   
All other parahumans on that world , mind .   
No exceptions .   
Which the organization deemed fine , because they got to keep her in their back pocket , even while they could n’t control her .   
She is , or was , a grab - bag , she found a way to pull free of her cluster , and she came out of it with a set of powers that would each be world - class on their own .
”
“
What happened to the others ?
”
Rain asked .
“ Dead ?
” I guessed .
“ Alive .   
Four of them , anyhow .   
A fifth killed themselves because they could n’t fill the void where the power and feeling powerful once were .   
None of them were left with more than whispers of power after .   
But they had their lives and their particular dynamic was stopped in its tracks .   
Not all clusters have a schtick , but they did , like the mall group does , and Goddess taking all the power brought an end to it .
”
“ You were going to tell Cradle how to do it , ” Rain said .   
“
How to get all the power and leave the rest of us with nothing .
”
“
Can you fault me ?   
He ’s the most level headed , and out of the rest of the group , one was an raging asshole , my second choice of the bunch by the way , one ca n’t take her mask off because if she does she ca n’t help but scream , and the last member of the group kept the door locked while a mall full of people were trampled , burned , and - or suffocated .
”
“
He would have gotten all the power for himself ?
” I asked .
“
The last time this worked , the parahuman was way more than the sum of the individual parts .   
I ’ve tried to sell Foil on it , but she is n’t too keen .
”
“ I do n’t want to tamper , ” Foil said .
“ I do n’t either , ” Parian said .
“
She ’s happy , see ?   
Cradle , though ?   
He was one hundred percent the type to go for it , all signs pointed to yes , and he said no .
”
“
Because he ’s a cluster cape , ” Chris said .   
“
You had a bad read .
”
Prodding her .
“
No .   
Because then I would have had a capital - N - slash - capital - A , underlined , for my thinker read on him .
”
Prodding her and it worked .
“
There ’s an issue with this , ” Capricorn said .
“
A few , actually , ” Sveta said .
“
The one that springs to mind is that you wanted to repeat the process that , the last time it worked , saw a whole Earth being taken over ?
” Capricorn asked .
“ He would have owed me one , ” Tattletale said .   
“
I do n’t think he would have been as strong .   
Four powersets baseline .
”
“ I think the last thing the world needs is more over - the - top parahumans , ” I said .
“ I think you ’re situated on in your own little peninsula ,    with your own little team , while I ’m the one who has spent the last two years trying to help the peace stay peaceful .   
Like
I said , there are a lot of people trying to keep things upright , but they are n’t communicating , they ca n’t , and the guys on the far side of everything are pushing really frigging hard to keep things from toppling , and something ’s going to give .   
Over here ?   
We ca n’t push back .   
We do n’t have muscle .
”
“
That ’s why you want Cradle ?
”
Rain asked .   
“
To be your muscle ?
”
“
No .   
That ’s my last ditch move , believe me .   
For now , there ’s another player who ’s pushing on things .   
Someone we tried really frigging hard to kick down an metaphorical elevator shaft , as it happens .
”
“ Ha , ” Imp said .   
“
That asshole .
”
“ We broke his legs and we scared him away , and he ’s good at hiding .   
He likes tinkers and he ’s interested in complex powers .   
If I could have a tinker I can trust with the right emotion power for the task at hand ?
”
“ Cradle , ” Capricorn said .
“ I ’d need to have a conversation with him .   
A long one , so I can figure out what went wrong back there .   
If he was n’t too compromised and my idea of giving him all the powers was tempting for him , he ’d go run this errand for me , spend about a year in a completely different Earth with no access to your Fallen boy there .   
I ’d figure out what to do with him by the conclusion of it .
”
“
If he was compromised ?
” Ashley asked .
“ Cross that bridge when I come to it , ” Tattletale said .
Ashley made a gun with the fingers and thumb of her good hand .   
A glitch manifested at a fingertip as she ‘ fired’ it .   
The projected image flickered violently , presumably where her power was kicking in , the effect tracing around her hand as she lowered it , joined by a plume of more artifacting and glitches at the damaged spot of her arm .   
The sound was muted , and the camera whined .   
A dog barked .
“ My dogs do n’t like that sound , ” Rachel said .   
“ Stop .
”
Looksee thumped the camera .
“
Assuming you ’re suggesting I kill him , it ’s not out of the question , ” Tattletale said .   
“
I ’m not as shy as you lot pretend to be .   
I ca n’t push that hard on things as a whole .   
I do n’t have the muscle some of the major players do , and that ’s just reality .   
I can try to open channels and hamstring the ones who are n’t helping .   
I need Cradle .   
Give me him , I can help you guys with the Fallen .
”
We exchanged glances .
“
I ’m not happy you were keeping this secret , ” Foil said .
“ I ’ve offered to rope you guys in .   
You ’re making and distributing clothes and doing your mercenary thing , ” Tattletale said .   
“ If you only join for the big stuff , it gets hard to get you up to speed , especially if I do n’t want to tip off someone like Cradle .   
If you insist this is my thing and that you want no part in it , do n’t get so upset if I do it in a very Tattletale way .
”
“
She ’s lonely , ” Imp said .
“ I ’m irritated , ” Tattletale said .   
“
I ’m tired .   
We ’ve got the lady in blue trying to get up to full strength again , a guy who wears fucking sweaters is pulling at the threads that are holding everything together while maintaining and expanding the institution side of the old Cauldron .   
A handful of others are running the ideological end of Cauldron .   
Both of those groups are strong in their own way and yet they are n’t doing a tenth what Cauldron used to do in forestalling disasters and containing the most … unproductive capes and cape - related messes .
”
“ They ’re rebuilding Cauldron ?
”
Sveta asked , horrified .
“
The day the Cauldron cracked , they were there moving in with what would be hundreds of employees .   
You were there at one point .   
You had to have seen the empty offices and rooms .   
Every last one of those offices have people now .   
Are they doing things on the level of what they did to you guys ?   
No .   
But only because they lack the opportunity .
”
“
Oh my god , ” Sveta said .
“
And again , there used to be an awful lot of really fucked up parahumans , powers and power - related things that would have top tier capes moving in to relocate or destroy , before those things were even a problem .   
Those guys are n’t doing that clean - up anymore !   
I ’ve taken some of that on my plate , in the course of my regular business .   
There ’s a war starting sometime this week , a Machine Army that ’s literally on the horizon if you can see between worlds , warlords , broken triggers , and
yeah , the Fallen are a mess unto themselves .
”
“ They have reach , ” I said .   
“
They ’re hooking people in .
”
“ I know they ’re a thing .   
They ’re a relatively manageable thing .   
Let ’s not forget that , you know , if every single last one of these manageable and less manageable problems I ’ve mentioned were magically handled , this city would not be in an especially good place .   
Okay ?   
That ’s
what I ’m doing .   
Could I have handled this particular thing better ?   
Probably .   
But I ’m not the bad guy .
”
“ Sounds major , ” I said .
Tattletale shrugged .   
She shifted position where she sat on the table , crossing her legs .   
She grabbed her ankles with her hands .
“
Thank you for doing what you ’ve been doing , ” I said .
“
It ’s nice to get that from someone , ” she said .
“
But I ca n’t help but notice that through all of this , explaining yourself , you have n’t actually apologized for your part in it .
”
Rain was very still , to the point that I was n’t sure if he ’d glitched out and frozen again , with the camera needing more percussive maintenance .
But his hair moved .   
The breathing continued .
Tattletale replied , “ Whatever I say , you find fault in it .   
Forget words .   
Look at my actions here .
”
Capricorn answered her .   
“
Your action is that you ’re giving us help , but it ’s help in exchange for this person you need , someone you ’ve shown you ca n’t keep on top of .   
That person wants my friend dead .   
If the tables were turned , would you consider that gracious ?
”
“ Tattletale , ” Sveta said , adding her voice to his .   
“
You have to know those Fallen are going to hurt people .   
You ca n’t want that .   
When everything went to shit and the world ended , there was an implicit trust .   
Can we take a step back toward that ?   
Give us this .   
Then we ’ll talk , we ’ll bring others into the discussion .
”
“ Spies and moles .   
Some with thinker or changer powers , ” Tattletale said .   
“ Have to limit who we bring into the discussion .   
Look at what happened back outside New Haven .   
I ’m deeming you guys , like , sixty percent safe , which I normally would n’t work with , but if I do n’t deal with you then I might lose these guys .
”
She jerked her thumb at the Undersiders .
“ If you think you ’re getting rid of me for good , you ’re deluded , ” Imp said .   
“
Though I have to say I was pretty disappointed at the start there .
”
“
Have I redeemed myself in your eyes ?
”
Tattletale asked , sarcastic .
“
You ’re okayish , ” Imp said .
“
I ’m so glad .
”
Tattletale answered Imp , but I could see that her attention was on Foil and Parian .
Rachel could apparently be assumed to be fine with things .
I could see the pair mulling things over .   
As they whispered , Tattletale ’s focus still pointed in their direction , it became harder to say that she was n’t waiting for a verdict from them .
“
Can we trust her ?
”
Capricorn asked .   
He ’d drawn closer to me , and now spoke in my ear .   
Sveta was already situated near enough to me to hear the question .
I could n’t give an immediate answer .
Looksee approached us .   
She brought the camera , which struggled to keep the projections stable as it bobbed , but it seemed to serve to allow Rain and Ashley to join our conversation .   
Chris was the last to catch up with us .
“
I trust her , ” Looksee said .   
“
I asked her to dish dirt on me
and she did .
”
“
That ’s the worst way of telling , ” Chris said .
“ Being treated crummy is way better than being ignored , ” Looksee said .
“
That ’s not right , ” Ashley said .   
“
Do n’t ever let someone who should care about you treat you badly .
”
“
Yeah ?   
Okay .   
Then do n’t talk to me right now .   
I ’m mad at you .   
I ’m mad at mostly everyone but especially you .
”
“ Especially me ?
”
“
Especially you .
”
“ Fair .
”
“
Everyone ’s
input is important here , ” Capricorn said .   
“
But Rain , you were the one who was hurt .   
Victoria , you know Tattletale best out of all of us .
”
“ We need to help those people , ” Sveta said .
“ I know , ” Capricorn said .   
“
But I think if Rain feels conflicted about releasing Cradle , even with this new information- ”
“
Which may or may not be true , ” Chris interrupted .
“
It ’s understandable , is n’t it ?
”
Capricorn asked .
“ Conflicted is understandable , ” Sveta said .   
“ I had to face down the person who changed me in a life - altering way .   
I know you ’re connected to them .   
You ca n’t get away from them .   
I see it ’s similar in a way
and I understand .   
I really do .
”
“
It ’s a question of what you ’d regret , I think , ” I said .
“
Meaning you think Rain should release Cradle to buy Tattletale ’s help , ” Chris said .
“ I do n’t think that at all , ” I said .   
“
I think … you can help the most people possible , and you can still end up with horrible regrets and serious consequences .
”
“
She got to you .
”
It took me a second to connect to who had spoken .   
Sveta .
She was partially focused on Tattletale .   
Imp , Rachel , Parian and Foil were talking in an animated way , with some henchmen on the very periphery .   
Tattletale had n’t budged from her seat , her attention focused on nothing in particular .
“ Tattletale , ” I finished the thought .   
“ Maybe she did .
”
“
You trust her ?
”
Capricorn asked , again .
“
No , ” I said .   
“
But I think I believe her .
”
“
Fuck , ” Rain said .
All heads turned to face his projection , except Looksee , who looked at the camera instead .
“ If it comes down to regretting deaths five years from now or saving lives and maybe not living through the next five years , I guess I ’ll save the lives , ” Rain said .
“ You ’re sure ?
” Capricorn asked .
“
No .   
But I spent my whole life as a believer .   
I ’ll believe this is the right thing .
”
“ Come on , ” Capricorn said .
As a group , we walked over to the Undersiders’ huddle .   
Tattletale rotated herself on her seat atop the concrete slab table with a push of her hand , to stay facing us .
The Undersiders broke away from their cluster to face us as we drew nearer .   
One of the dogs growled , and Rachel shushed it .
“ Tattletale , ” Parian said .   
“
We think you should make amends here .
”
Tattletale ’s eyes roved over our group .   
She fixed them on Rain .
She knew .   
She knew what we came to say .   
That Rain had come to the conclusion he had .
“ Amends , ” she said .   
“
I ’ll point you at the Fallen .   
You do n’t have to give me Cradle .   
If I really need him , I ’ll discuss it with you and get permission first .
” ⊙ Boston .   
New Boston , but all attempts to make that stick had failed , in a stark contrast to how Brockton Bay had been so ready to rechristen itself as New Brockton .
Boston was n’t a city , really .   
It was more of an Über - neighborhood , one set of tiles in the vast , disappearing - into - the - horizon expanse of city that was the megalopolis .   
It was n’t really Boston , either .   
Attempts had been made to make Boston resemble its former self , but materials were different , everything was new , and the golden patina remained .
Fenway Station .   
A transportation hub , surrounded by quickly thrown - together homes that attempted to stay hidden or camouflaged among the brownstone and brick fixtures with gold - tinted windows .
The Boston neighorhoods had heroes of their own .   
Independents , and small teams separate from the Wardens .   
With Tattletale making the calls , we had their help .   
There were others , but Tattletale felt they were a risk , with a chance of moles and troublemakers , and I believed her .
Everyone was finding a location .   
Looksee had one working camera doing sweeps , and the laptop beside her showed the figures .   
Some were highlighted in red .   
Strange body shapes , statures , or more muscle than the usual .   
When they clustered , we could know that the people on one floor or one set of floors of a building were likely capes .
People from the Clans were out on the street .   
Not many bikers .   
There would be Fallen too .
I sat on the edge of a roof , and Looksee sat with her back to the lip of the roof beside me , her laptop placed where the both of us could see it .   
Sveta sat beside me , and shifted position to rest her head on my shoulder .   
Like old times .
“
Capricorn ?
”
Looksee asked .
A pause .
“
Red pickup , rust at left wheel .   
A bit ahead of you .   
It has guns in the back , ” she said .
Another pause .
“ Sounds good , ” she said .
“
How ’re you managing your end of things ?
” Sveta asked .
“
It ’s pretty easy , ” Looksee said , without turning around .   
“ Facial recognition , tagging everyone that ’s a possible problem .
”
The cooperation of everyone we needed to cooperate .   
We had a secured perimeter , there were civilians inside that perimeter , but if we timed our attack just right , then there was a good chance we could evacuate them out .   
Sveta and I were in the wings .   
Capricorn could bar the path to bystanders .
The team was missing Rain , who was still recuperating .   
Ashley was waiting for proper transportation to a secure facility .
This was , in a way , a microcosm of the conflict we ’d just weathered .   
We were tired , hurting , and pushing forward purely on the energy that came from this being something we really wanted to do .
Sveta , Kenzie , Tristan , Byron , myself .   
We wanted to be heroes .   
I liked to think we were heroes .
Chris-
he was out there , at one of the distant corners of the perimeter , being Chris and keeping an eye on things .   
He ’d told us that he could change twice a day , but he ’d also implied it would n’t be a problem if trouble headed his way , that he ’d be okay .
Hard to tell , sometimes , when parahumans could be so foolhardy .
Chris wanted-
not to be a hero .   
He seemed to want something out of being a hero .
Rain and Ashley-
I was pretty sure they needed to be heroes , but it was n’t a need in the same way I needed to be a hero
or I was n’t living up to some fundamental part of myself .   
They needed to be heroes in the sense that someone who was freezing to death needed to start fires .
Rain had taken a giant step forward in that regard , and Ashley had fallen back .
I knew what I needed to do .   
I ’d keep tabs on them .   
I ’d go to dinner with Kenzie and ensure that she knew that if the team did in fact fall apart , it did n’t mean the relationships were gone .   
I ’d check on Chris’ situation , because what Tattletale had said concerned me .   
I ’d follow up on Tristan .   
I ’d continue to visit Sveta at her place , and see Weld .   
I would check in on on Ashley and Rain , whatever path they had ahead of them .   
If that meant making sure they had visitors in jail , then I ’d handle that .
“ They want the go - ahead to attack , ” Looksee said .
I had a bird ’s eye view of everything .   
I surveyed the situation , checked the laptop .
“
They want it soon .   
People are getting into cars in the parking garage .   
Some of those cars have guns .
”
I gave her a thumbs up .
“
Attacking , ” she reported .
Cars pulled out of the parking garage .   
They skidded through puddles , and the puddles solidified .   
The first truck lost the rubber from three of its wheels , skidding forward on the rims and one corner of the front end .   
The one behind it stopped abruptly , with the vehicles behind it crashing into it , in a three - car pileup .
I saw the colors as capes descended on the scene .   
As more left the bottom floor of the building on foot , and yet others climbed out by way of the fire escape , it quickly became an all - out brawl .
It was weird to be removed from it , to not be leaping in .   
I was reminded of how I ’d felt when I ’d been on the patrol block .   
I ’d handled the research , tutored the kids , gave presentations on key things about parahumans , and I ’d handled the routine errands like taking water out to tent cities and out past the portals .
A part of me had wanted to leap into things , and that part of me had stopped because it had known that leaping in had meant using the wretch , and I had n’t been ready to do that .
I ’d gone from stark nightmare to vague , new reality and I ’d struggled hard in the transition .   
I ’d thought I was getting better , settling for the vague reality , no longer fighting it .   
Staying still and going easy had meant letting myself heal , had n’t it ?
Then the attack on the community center .   
The reality check .   
Then finding out that this world did n’t really have a place in it for me , if I really wanted to be me .
Then the therapy team .
Even that had felt indistinct somehow .   
When I ’d introduced the topic of being heroes , had n’t I talked about the kinds of hero ?   
The ways money came in- we ’d started to do that , but indistinctly .   
Heroes were ideological , or they were about money .   
They could be heroes for a cause or specific mission .
Indistinct because we ’d been a mix of heroes at heart , heroes to serve ends , and those who needed to be heroes , but who , at the time , were n’t .
Looksee was struggling with saying goodbye to people .   
I was telling myself I could keep the people , but I struggled with saying goodbye to the idea .
“ Fire , ” Sveta said .
The jackasses were spreading out , and I saw the orange tint of flame , the black of smoke .   
They were setting fire to the trash that had been set out , to a dumpster , and to the contents of one ruined truck bed .
I heard Capricorn ’s voice through my earphone , even though the earphone was n’t plugged into my ear .
“
He says he ’s got it .
”
I adjusted my earbud to bring the attached microphone closer to my mouth .   
“
Careful of any explosives in the truck bed .
”
“
Got it , ” I heard his reply .
“ Group leaving the corner of the building , ” Looksee said .   
“
It might be major capes , using the big fight for a distraction .
” Sveta lifted her head from my shoulder .
“
Who ’s on it ?
” I asked .
“
Nobody .   
There ’s a perimeter that should catch them , they ’ll get there in a few minutes .
”
“
And nobody stopping them from hurting anyone on the way ?
” Sveta asked .
“
No , I guess not .
”
I lifted off , floating away from the edge of the roof .
“
Keep the camera close , ” I said , putting my earphone in , before adjusting the flap at the base of my hood to hide the cord .   
“
We delay them until others come .   
Looksee ?   
Point those others our way .
”
“
On it .
”
Best to include her .   
Things breaking apart would hit her hardest .   
It was just so hard to do without actually having her in the field .
Sveta grabbed something and hurled herself off the rooftop .
I could see the bright colors , as I drew closer .   
The exposed skin of arms sticking out of sleeveless shirts was heavily and brightly tattooed .
Jackasses , maybe .   
It was almost motley .   
I saw two of them ran with their hands tucked in their jackets .   
Holding something out of sight .
And among them , someone who was n’t a twenty - something in bright color .   
A guy , long - limbed with long bleached hair with dark roots and a goatee , jogging and moving with languid ease that belied something else at play .   
He wore black .
Sveta grabbed onto the light pole near me and pulled herself to it .   
I floated next to her .
“ Grab the tall one ?
” I asked .   
“ If there ’s trouble from others , I deflect .   
If it ’s trouble from him , I hit him hard enough he stops doing it .
”
She nodded .
Her hand grabbed at the guy
’s arm as I got to the group .   
I went straight for the jackass with his hand in his jacket , knocking him into the ground with enough force that if he was n’t unconscious , he was broken enough to not be a threat .
The other one whipped out a gun .   
His eyes widened as he saw me flying , and then he turned , pointing the gun down the street .   
There were people .   
Distant , but people .
I caught his arm and shoved it down as he pulled the trigger .   
I leveraged the wretch , used the strength , and snapped the bones of his arm .
The tall guy-
Sveta had grabbed him , but now the other four jackasses were splitting into ghostly images-
each was distorted , and each pulled away from the source jackass with an acrobatic leap or flip .   
They were massing on Sveta ’s arm and glove , weighing it down .
She pulled and she drew the guy in , but it was slow and sluggish .
Instead , I grabbed the guy from behind , hauling him backward .   
She let go of him , and with her hand free of that grip , it began to pull and slip back through the group .
The duplicates .   
This was one of the Crowley leaders .
His eyes were wide and showing too much white as he turned my way .
His own faded duplicates swarmed me , hands and faces and the press of the physical .   
They came at me hard and fast , like they were propelled away from him by some motive force .   
When they made contact , they were n’t strong .
But I felt myself losing even though the strength was n’t all that .
Where they overlapped .
I met them with the Wretch , pushing them off and away with some violence .   
I struck at the overlapping portions , where one swing could hit multiple .
He ’d broken free of my grip in the midst of the storm he had created .   
Now he backed away .   
He moved his hands , and all around me , mailboxes , light posts , trash and individual pieces of a nearby car broke away , becoming a storm of shadowy projectiles .
Were it one projectile , I could have dodged .   
Were it a handful of meaningful ones , it would have been easier .   
As it was , it was a hundred inconsequential projectiles , and where they converged or overlapped , they were solid or more solid .
I was forced to fly at an odd course , up , back and away , so I would n’t fly into any of the incoming images .   
The stream changed course , everything flying toward my new location .   
I moved from point to point , to make getting a bead on me as hard as possible .
And between me and him , it was a veritable wall of flying images , concrete and glass peeling away from the sidewalk and nearby windows like paper from a stack that never ended .   
Only these papers crashed and shattered on impact .
“ You think you ’ve won , ” the Crowley leader said .
Sveta was free of the jackasses , as she clung to the wall .   
She ’d grabbed a gun from their midst and held it on one hand .   
She seemed to have found herself in a bind in the process .   
The gun could n’t be dropped without delivering it to the same people she ’d taken it from , could n’t be thrown away because it was a gun , and she did n’t have the dexterity to put it in a pocket where it might stay for good .   
At the same time , while her hand held the weapon , she was limited in mobility .
I put my hands out .
She launched the gun .
“
You have n’t won , ” the Crowley brother said .
I smacked the gun with the Wretch hard enough to shatter it .
“
We have n’t lost , ” I said .   
“
The Fallen are n’t going to have a lot going for them when most of you are in custody .   
Today was a pretty bad day for assholes .
”
“ You think we ’re broken , bitch ?
”
Sveta reached out , seizing him by the neck .
He created shadow - selves , and they pulled away from his body in a way that broke her grip .   
The initial momentum still yanked him back and off his feet .   
He climbed to a standing position , shadow - selves appearing in crouching positions , forming people for him to lean on as he climbed up to his feet .
I ’d known Eric to do the same kind of thing .   
Crystal
’s brother had been good with forcefields .
This guy was more of a forcefield creator than a duplicator , if I thought about it .   
The forcefields were just very detailed simulacra of whatever he was spawning them from , and there was utility in how they emerged and flew out .
It was easier to fly and flow between them .   
Thinking about it all like that , I could fight him .   
A shift in mindset .
He still concentrated a lot of them near him .   
That was the barrier .
I could also wait for the reinforcements .
I would n’t .   
I ’d take him with one hand .
“ The fire ’s handled , but they have friends in the neighborhood , ” Capricorn said , over comms .
“ Noted , ” I murmured .
The jackasses were spreading out .   
Several made a run for it .   
Sveta snatched at them , holding and pulling long enough to break their stride and keep them from getting way .
The Crowley brother saw , and he smirked , showing teeth so white they had to be fake .
“ If this comes down to a fight , you ’re leaving on a stretcher , ” I said .   
“
I ’m all out of patience .
”
“
Can you fight ?
” he asked .
I hit the ground hard enough to crack it .   
I ’d pay the neighborhood back for that .   
But the impact was enough to upset his footing , and as his frame of reference changed , so did the angle and flow of the phantom images .    
He tipped back , and there was a clearance of a few feet off the ground in front of him where the images were n’t .
I dove , flying , and slid through that clearance .   
It was a maneuver that put me within a few feet of him .   
I reached out , striking with my good arm , and I felt the impact .   
No strength , but a smash to the nose .
A phantom ’s nose .   
He ’d projected one out from his face as I ’d swung .
I followed up , hitting , kicking , and then doing the same thing but with the wretch , for the extra force and the ability to tear right past them .   
I could see him press back , until his jackasses were right behind him .   
Sveta yanked on the jackasses , hauling them away , and the Crowley brother tipped backward onto his back .
“ Stretcher or surrender ?
”
I asked , amping up the aura in a subtle way .   
Too big of a push could scare , but it also was a thing .   
Something people could push back against .
I could use it here to play it subtle , drive the moment home .
“
Fine then , ” he said .   
He smiled , and he dismissed the images .   
The transparent detritus , trash , objects and figures faded out .
I remained tense .   
What was the catch ?
“ Bro , ” one Jackass said .
“ We ’ll surrender if you give us a seat to enjoy the show , ” he said .
I did n’t respond , only glancing at Sveta .
She was as lost as I was .








“ Looksee , ” I said .   
“
Are you there ?
”
“
Always , ” came the reply .
“ I have someone with me that I ’m
pretty sure is one of the Crowley brothers , ” I said .   
I noted the slight nod , and the almost satisfied expression from the man .   
It was n’t him faking me out , I was pretty sure .   
Instead , he seemed to like the recognition , even to the point that he was willing to give up information to bask in it .   
“
He says something bad is up .
”
“
Capricorn and Sveta are dealing with people with guns .   
That ’s bad .
”
“
Something big , ” I said .
“ I ’ll call everyone .
”
“ Please .   
Start with authorities .   
Wardens .   
Then the team .
”
The Crowley brother still had his hands up in surrender .   
It did n’t really mean a lot , a lot of the time .   
There was no position or way of being that would make a parahuman a non - threat .
This was where we needed the help of the patrol .   
I had one Crowley and a bunch of Jackasses that had surrendered , they apparently had guns , and …
what ?   
I had nowhere to take them , I could n’t drag the leader off without the others causing trouble or hurting someone , and I could n’t easily cuff them with one hand .
I was forced to wait if I did n’t want to let them go .
“
Writing a text message to send to Wardens since their phone lines are garbage awful .   
I ’ll have Capricorn on the line .   
The connection died when he switched .   
One sec .
”
I could hear the background noise over Capricorn ’s voice .   
Byron ’s voice , against a backdrop of shouting .   
“ Victoria ?
”
“ Something big ’s happening .   
I caught one of the leaders and he ’s smug , ” I said .
The Crowley brother smiled .
“ Bait ?
” Chris asked .   
“
What ’s the context ?
”
Sveta approached , standing beside me where she could keep an eye on some of the Jackasses .
“
I threatened to break his arms and legs .   
He surrendered , arms up , and said he ’ll cooperate if he gets to see the show .
”
“ If you threaten to break someone
’s
arms and legs , I ’m
pretty sure they ’ll say anything , ” Chris said .
“
I like how you say that like you have experience on the subject , ” Looksee said .
“ I ’ve met some shitty people over the years .   
You can learn a lot from shitty people .
”
“
Focus , please , ” Byron said .   
The shouting was louder .   
“ One-
”
“
He cut out , ” Looksee reported .   
“
He changed and the connection did n’t translate .   
I thought I jiggered it right
but this is really not my area of expertise .   
I think it ’s because of my phone box …
”
She went on , saying more , tinker talk .   
While she talked , one of the Jackasses turned to his boss .   
“ We do n’t have to put up with this , Vince .
”
“
It ’s fine .   
Stay put , ” Vince Crowley said .
Middle brother .   
It made sense that he was here .   
The other brothers were supposedly present , but this was the guy who was looped in with the Mathers .   
The Mathers family traded family members to and from other branches , connecting families and cementing ties .   
The Mathers had also kidnapped kids .   
Vince Crowley and his sister had been the ones handling the Crowley end of the deal .   
They were smugglers , thieves , and general assholes who had dodged the reaching arms of the heroes , while providing shelter to the real monsters , and implicitly accepting some really fucked up stuff .
The McVeays had been murderers and zealots , the Mathers were kidnappers , among other things , and Vince and Sabrina Crowley had been enablers .   
They were smugglers , they ’d kept kidnapping victims and sheltered murderers while there was too much attention and heat on them , and they ’d almost gotten away with it , despite being up against the whole PRT .
Sabrina had been caught , as were several sub - cells and supporters of that particular family unit .   
They ’d disappeared , they ’d reappeared after Gold Morning , Sabrina back with her brother , and I knew about them because the patrol blocks were keeping tabs on them .
“
Capricorn ’s back .   
I ’m doing stuff , ” Looksee said .   
“
I ’m checking-
I do n’t see news .   
No rise in phone activity .   
No posts online .
”
“
He said tonight , ” I said .
“ We ’re getting closer to ‘ night’ , ” Capricorn said .   
Tristan .
“ Looksee , ” I said .   
“
You had something keeping an eye on the phones in Hollow Point .   
Your phone box ?
”
“
Yeah .
”
“ Can you go backward ?   
See who these guys have been talking to ?
”
The Jackass next to Vince whipped his head around .   
Vince did n’t react much , but it was telling .   
I added , “ We know where they were in the building .   
Can you use that to place the calls ?
”
“
Yup .   
Well , not to who .   
But I can figure out where .
”
“ Perfect , ” I said .   
I met Vince ’s eyes , trying to gauge what he thought .   
Too hard to read .   
“
How hard will it be ?
”
“ Not hard , ” she said .   
“
It ’s already set up .   
I punch in the location data .   
Already half done .
”
“
Already half done , ” I told Sveta , my thumb on the switch to the microphone on the earbud ’s cord .
“
Good job , Looksee , ” Sveta murmured .
“ And done .   
Gimme a minute .
” I smiled .
Part of the intent of my statement and the whole intent of the smile was to see what reaction it got from Vince Crowley .   
It was provocative ,
yes –
I knew I might push them to do something .   
The real reason was to try and assess how serious of a thing this was .
I could see the agitation of a couple of the Jackasses’ .   
Whatever they were , borderline sociopathic , brave to a fault , dangerous , they were n’t actors or bluffers .   
Vince tried , but I could see a faint frown line between his eyebrows that had n’t been there before .
“
Calls were made from the building they were in , just after they arrived .
”
“
To ? ”
Chris asked .
“
To … there was a flurry of them to a place
that’s-
it ’s not far away .   
I ’m trying to find a map online to overlay and the webpage is glaaaacial .
”
The heroes who ’d been at the perimeter were approaching now , jogging our way .   
They would ’ve been the final line of defense had the Crowleys kept running .   
Three heroes local to Boston .   
All wore bright colors and impractical costumes with extra flaps , layers , and extraneous bits of cloth that made them very ‘ costumey’ , in a way that made me think of a superhero in a kid ’s show .
Magic Knight Crash wore a high - collared top that hung off of him , leaving everything from armpit to pelvis exposed , while his front and back were covered .   
He had four belts , not including straps at his arm and thigh , and he had a spiked shield mounted on the side of an engine that had a handle at the back and other side .   
Seafoam and purple .
Mystic Magic Impaler was similar , but she wore an eyepatch with a smiley face on it , a drill bit running through the smiley ’s head .   
The same icon was painted on the bare skin between cleavage and collarbone , and her outfit and hair were predominantly blue with some orange .   
The entire setup had far too many ribbons for someone with power drill lances mounted on her wrists , the bits columns , not cones .   
If the color scheme did n’t sell the image , the combination of power tools , long hair and loose clothing did .
Dynamite Warrior Dash Fantastic was the most sane of them .   
She at least avoided having twenty - plus things on her costume that her enemies could grab , and had some body armor , as paradoxical as it was to have her belly bare beneath a crop top with armor panels on it .   
She was curvy , with a round face , and war paint on her cheekbones .   
Her hair was short and pulled back in pigtails that were only an inch and a half long .   
She did n’t have a weapon ,
unless the assault to the senses from the orange and purple camo counted .
Yes , I had some loose clothing , and I had my hair out , but I also had the security of the wretch , and I ’d made some effort to practicality , with the armor and coverage .   
These guys treated practicality like it was the enemy .
That was n’t me jumping to conclusions .   
I knew of the M.K.C. and M.M.I. pairing from before Gold Morning .   
I ’d been aware they ’d made it through that , and their names had come up during the planning for this thing .   
They ’d been a ‘ we ’ll call and see if they ’ll help’ .   
Despite appearances and past history , Tattletale had insisted they were trustworthy .   
I ’d secretly hoped they flake out like they ’d been known to in past crises , even at the same time I ’d known we needed all the assistance we could get .
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuugh .
“
Working , working , ” Looksee could be heard in the background .   
“
I ’m finding more calls but Cap keeps blipping out and I ’m trying to stay in touch with him .   
I think my phone box is too far away .
”
“
Sorry .   
Keep it up , ” Capricorn said .
I closed my eyes .   
I had to focus on the immediate present , and helping where I could help .
“
Who ’s in charge ?
” I asked .
“
Me , ” Dynamite said .
“
Who did you talk to before coming ?
”
“
Imp .   
She called in a favor .
” I hesitated .   
Sveta nudged me .
“
He says something else is up .   
We ’re chasing it down .   
Can you keep them in custody ?   
At least one has powers .
”
“
It ’s why we ’re here , ” Magic Knight Crash said .   
He had colored lenses that masked his pupils and irises to make his eyes teal from corner to corner , and his mask covered his eyebrows , making it hard to read his expression .   
He sounded confident , but the problem with these guys was that their entire persona was over the top confidence .
“
The guy with the beard is Vince Crowley .   
Duplication of self and objects .   
The duplications launch out , and he can put out a lot of them .   
They do n’t have much substance unless they overlap .   
He ’s usually not far from his sister , Sabrina , and we have n’t seen her .   
She ’s a mover on a mass scale .   
Raider and getaway .
”
“
That ’s Empusa , ” Dynamite said .
“
Yes , ” I said .
“
She ’s been seen around here .   
She ’s strong but she has n’t done much .   
We can deal with her .
”
“
With a five hit drill punch combo , ” Mystic Magic Impaler announced , floating off the ground .   
She stabbed at the air with her drills .
Fucking why was this a thing ?    
I felt embarrassed and it was n’t even me saying it .
“
You can deal with him ?
”
I asked , indicating Vince .   
“ Flood of projections ?
”
“ Would firepower work ?   
Cut or blast through it all ?
”
Dynamite asked .   
At my nod , she asked , “ Can we kill him if he ’s too much of a problem ? ”
“ Or maim ?
” Impaler asked .
I felt something inside of me die at the question .   
Yes , I ’d threatened maiming , I even used maiming as a necessary tool , when there was n’t a polite way to remove someone from a fight .   
Impaler was trying so hard to celebrate it and make it her thing .
“ Leave him alive if possible , ” I said .   
“
He might be one of the only ones who knows about this thing that ’s going on .   
If you get any inkling about what ’s going on , call us , let us know .
”
“
The deal was that I surrender only if I get a view , ” Vince said .
“
A view of what ?
” Sveta asked .
“ Take us up to any rooftop .   
I ’ll sit , whistle , and wait , ” he said .
“ Any rooftop ?
”
“
Ah , ” he said .   
He looked around .   
“ One with a view of the horizon .
” Of the horizon .
Shit , no .   
I really hoped this was a head game .
I exchanged looks with Dynamite .
From what little I knew of Sabrina Crowley , who I could remember a little more easily because she did n’t blend in so much with her brothers , she charged up and released a ‘ wave’ effect , about as tall and as big around as a house .   
People in the original ‘ cast’ could fly within the area of the slow - rolling wave , and there was some duplication trickery in there somewhere because she was from the Crowley family unit .   
She used it to hit a location with a whole squad of people who could fly on top of having other powers , or to get her entire team away .
And from what I knew of this team , they might have been just the right people to tackle that particular set of problems .
“
It would make it harder for Empusa to rescue him with her power .   
We ’d see her coming if she aimed at a rooftop , ” Dynamite said .
“ If you ’re okay with it , ” I said .   
“
Okay .   
Give him what he wants .
”
She put a hand out .   
I clasped it for a moment .   
She turned to her subordinates , and immediately began haranguing them in the manner of a no - nonsense prison guard that was used to dealing with unruly inmates .
I felt a bit better about these guys now .
“ We should help Capricorn , ” Sveta said .
I nodded , putting a hand on her shoulder as we jogged away .   
When we were a polite distance away , I took flight and Sveta grabbed my shoulder , using me for the first portion of her trip .
“ Coming your way , Capricorn , ” I said .
“
He ’s not on , ” Looksee said .   
“ I will as soon as I get a stable signal again .
”
“ Not on , ”
I repeated , for Sveta ’s benefit .   
“
Do you have a location for the call recipient ?
”
“
Some .   
A bunch , ackshully , ” Looksee said .   
“ Fenway Station .   
Calls made mid - event , when the brothers left the camp , and when they got to your area .
”
“
We ’re in Fenway station , ” I said .   
“
That ’s the name of the neighborhood .
”
“ Fenway Station Station , ” Looksee clarified .
The issues of nomenclature .
“
Call the Wardens .   
Do n’t brick their phones .   
Good work , Looksee ” Trains , stores , people , parahuman security , a portal to Bet .
Capricorn had Flechette -Foil- and Parian near him .   
Parian was trying to guard the other two , Foil was picking off the members of the Clans and the Fallen that were still lingering near the building , and the Clan were trying to set fire to Parian ’s dolls with thrown bottles .
Capricorn , in turn , was extinguishing the fires with water , and working to trap the Fallen in stone , splashing them with water before turning it to stone .
The idea had been to stay clear of the fight , but I could n’t imagine someone calling themselves a hero with a straight face and not wanting to help those in need .
Or needing to support those who were wanting help , maybe .
The lies we told ourselves , when need trumped reason .
Sveta went straight to Capricorn .   
I went straight to the Fallen .
There was one I recognized .   
He wore a latex demon mask with paint on it , but I ’d seen him a while ago , and he had Fallen flowing out from around him in a way that drew the eye when I was up in the air .   
On the ground , he would have been one masked face in the shuffle .   
In the air , I could see people emerging from the crowd , ducking out from between people when they had n’t been there before .
Maybe a small part of me had been looking for him .   
When I had talked to the Attendant about joining , he ’d been there .
The latex mask being what it was , he did n’t seem to have the ability to see in the upper periphery of his field of vision .   
He did n’t see me .   
I had the wretch up on the descent , to protect myself , and I dropped it just before flying my knee into his jaw , the hit punctuated by a heavy dose of my aura .
Swearing erupted around me .   
His power was flaring up , visible now , with arcs of red - orange light dancing between the people in the crowd he ’d been using to help form his gateways .   
People shrieked and cussed as they were burned .
Shouts overlapped .   
The mob with a focus became a scramble .   
Two people had one arc of portal energy , starting at one person
’s foot , running up the side of his body , along his arm , and out to the other person ’s hand , tracing down the body to the ground again .   
As they parted , the arc stretched and snapped , flailing out and striking the crowd or ground before dissipating .   
No serious damage done , to look at it , but the cracks and snaps were like whipcracks , driving the already retreating group to run more .   
Elsewhere , more portals were breaking .   
Some people were trying to stand still , fighting the tide of the crowd , because they had portals connected to them .
There .   
That was satisfying in a way I could n’t put my finger on .   
I could n’t even stop to contemplate it .   
I had to get to Capricorn , and we had to get to the station with the gateway to Earth Bet .
A flare of light caught my attention , but it was n’t portal light .   
A molotov .
There were people beneath me .   
In the moment , not entirely sure if the bottle would break through my defenses and splatter me or hit the wretch and splatter it , I positioned myself and the Wretch between the bottle and the crowd .
In that moment of acceptance of the fact I might burn , the memory of Crawler ’s venom and the pain that had followed felt so real
I felt like I was already on fire .   
It hit me like a punch to the gut , and my breath caught in my throat .
Idiots , the word flashed through my mind , aimed at the Fallen and members of the Clans .
Idiot , the word flashed through my mind , the singular reserved for myself .
The flaming projectile changed direction in midair , almost disappearing .   
I could follow the path it took , the orange in the gloomy , overcast drizzle tracing a line through my vision like Capricorn ’s power did .   
I saw the explosion , the bottle cast off to the side , landing in an inconsequential patch of road .   
Sveta had grabbed it .
Other heroes from the perimeter were collapsing in .   
I did n’t see anyone who might be the other Crowley brothers .   
Jake and Cutter .
I made two more quick strikes , targeting people who looked like they were giving orders or rallying the Fallen .   
I saw someone in passing who might have been Victor , from Brockton Bay , and in the moment I was trying to decide if it would be wise to try to go after him
, I saw that this was n’t close to over .
I flew to Capricorn , landing while still moving at a speed where I had to run a couple of steps and use a moment of flight to keep from stumbling .
“
Thank you , ”
I said , to Sveta .
“ Anytime .
”
There was no need to ask what it was .   
She got it .   
That-
this , I liked it .   
It would be nice to do the hero thing with her , even sometimes , even if the team fell through .
“
Did you catch what Looksee said ?
” Capricorn - Byron asked .
Had I ?   
No .   
I checked .   
The cord dangled .   
I popped it back in .   
“
Sorry , Looksee , my earphone came unplugged .
”
I could hear her , “ I ’m trying to figure this out .   
There are cameras at the station .   
I ’ve notified security .   
I ’m getting other stuff through the camera feeds .   
They ’re in a restaurant , I think .
”
Byron became Tristan .   
Tristan pointed , and we walked as a group .
I turned to Foil as we passed her .   
“ Thanks .
”
“ I wish we could talk more , ” she said .
“ Soon .
”
Capricorn stopped in his tracks .   
“ We should tell Tattletale .
”
“ Looksee ?
” I asked .   
“
She ’s looped in , is n’t she ?
”
“
I ’m talking to her when I get a chance , ” Looksee said .   
“
She ignores half of what I say .
”
“ She ’s running ops , ” Parian said .   
“
Besides , I think she ’s worn out .
”
“
This is big , ” I said .   
“
The Fallen said he wanted to see the horizon when this hits .
”
“ I ’ll call , ” Foil said .   
“ I ’ll make the gravity clear .
”
“ Thanks , ” Capricorn said .
“ Good fighting beside you , Cap , ” Foil said .
He gave her a nod .
The station was n’t far .
“
You could have gone without me , ” Capricorn said .
We could have .   
Just as Tattletale was worn out , so was I.   
I was hurt and that hurt was a dull ache with a more intense pain at the center that made it feel like it had a core or something lodged in it .   
Apparently a phantom symptom , with my nerves trying to process the damage .   
My focus was slipping a bit .
But I needed to be here .   
This whole thing , others might have needed us to be here .   
People still needed us , if there was anything to this attack or event tonight .
“
We … ”
I started , trying to voice my thoughts aloud .   
“
I hit things .   
Sveta grabs things .   
We can do other things , but … against a bomb ?   
Or whatever this is ?
”
“
You wanted a toolbox , ” Sveta said .
“ I wanted more of a team , ” I said .   
“ Looksee , listening in ?
”
“
Half listening .   
I ’m tracking these calls still .   
If we can figure out who , we could figure out how or what .
”
“
Good , ” Capricorn said .
“
Can you defuse bombs , Looksee ?
”
“
Maybe .   
I ’d have to see the bomb .
”
“ If you can , can you come ?   
Follow ?
”
“ I ’ll head there .
”
“ Chris ?
”
There was a wet sound over the phone .
“ I think he ate the phone , ” Looksee said .   
“
I hope he un - eats it before he changes back , or he ’s going to need either surgery or a slot shaped butthole .   
He ’s near the station .
”
“
Can we get him ?
” I asked .
“ We can try .   
I ’ll have my computer ping him until he listens .
”
“
I ’m running , ” Capricorn said .   
I was close enough to him that I could hear him on both phone and in person , with a bit of an echo .   
“ You guys move .   
The kids can follow behind .   
Keep an ear out for any calls to get away .
”
“
Yuh huh , ” Looksee replied , in the rushed kind of way that suggested she was too active or enthused to even form full words .   
She ’d been hurt and as close to sullen as Kenzie ever got , and that had faded into the background , almost forgotten .
Capricorn broke into a run .   
Sveta used her power to pull herself ahead .   
I took to the air .
“ Hanging up for a sec , ” I said .   
“
Wave at me if you need me on the phone .
”
“
Got it , ” Capricorn said .
I used my speed dial .   
I heard the phone ring twice .
Droplets of moisture touched my skin as I flew .   
Too far apart to be even a drizzle , it was moisture in the air .   
Half of the sky was dark .   
Too early for sunset , but the clouds were thick and the smoke and industry of the areas on the coast were contributing to the haze .
“ Victoria ?
” was the response .   
Gilpatrick ’s voice .   
I could hear the bus in the background .   
“
What happened in Boston ?
”
“
It ’s happening .   
The Fallen have guns .   
They were ready to shoot people .   
Heroes are intervening .   
It ’s not important-
”
“
It sounds important .
”
“
No .   
The Fallen have something big going on .   
Retaliatory , I think , or it ’s someone who ’s talking to them and using the attack today as a distraction for other things .
”
“
What kind of big ?
”
“
There ’s a possible attack hitting Fenway Station .   
We ’re on our way there .
”
“
We ’re too far away , Victoria .
”
“
The guy I ’m hearing this from is saying he wants to see it .   
On the horizon .   
He said it while a few blocks away from the target location .   
That could be him trying to mislead , but it could be …
”
“
Other attacks ?
”
“
Call , please ?   
This is an all - hands on deck thing .
”
The station .   
The building was made to look like an old building , even though it really was n’t .   
It was shaped like a plus sign , with a squat domed tower in the center , a red stone exterior , and arching entrances set at below ground level , with broad stairs leading down into them .   
There was infrastructure around the building for refugee intake , but the buildings were locked down and shuttered .
“ You guys are there ?
”
Looksee asked .   
“
I ’ve got them on camera .   
Sitting and drinking coffee while eating raspberry pie .   
I ’ve never had either of those things but that sounds like a bad combination .
”
“ Just so long as they ’re not doing anything , ” I said .   
Sveta caught up with me .   
I pointed at one entrance while walking to another .   
She nodded .
“ We do n’t want to scare them , ” Capricorn said .
“ We do want to be in a position to stop them , ” I said .
“ Go in , stay put .
”
There were kids from the patrol in the building as I entered , more alert than they usually were .   
They looked alarmed at my appearance .   
Had word traveled this far in the past couple of minutes ?
I pushed my hood back and held up my hands , approaching at a walk .
“ Stop , ” the junior captain said .   
She was black ,
a teenager Rain ’s age , her hair shaved at the side and brushed back and away from her face at the top .   
She had the ‘ cop’ look down one hundred percent .   
The technique too-
she ’d already had her gun in hand , out of sight , and she raised it to point it my way without hesitation .   
I could admire that kind of fluid confidence , as someone who ’d once had the same position .
“
We ’re on your side , ” I said .   
“
You just got an alert , right ? ”
She nodded .
“ I gave the info to Captain Gilpatrick at Bridgeport .   
I ’ve worked with him .   
He passed it to others .   
Something big is up , and we think the culprits are in the restaurant with the pie .
”
She did n’t ease up .
“
You ’ll want to evacuate , ” I said .   
“
Do it soft , we do n’t want to tip those guys off .   
Do n’t let people enter , encourage them to leave if you can do it quiet .   
Let the place naturally empty .
”
A light flashed at the desk , at a point I could n’t see-
but I could see the green LED reflected on the glossy black body armor she wore .   
Nicer quality stuff than we ’d had ,
but I supposed that came with the big city .
“ Ben , ” she said .
One of her squad members reached for the phone .   
There was a pause .
“
Bosses and cops say there ’s someone at the other door .   
Obvious parahuman .   
We ’re supposed to send one or two that way for numbers .
”
Bosses would mean captain .   
Cops would be the local authorities .   
One of the two should ’ve been making the real decisions .   
There should have been one close by here .
“
That ’s Sveta , ” I said .   
“
She ’s a case fifty - three .   
My friend and teammate .   
With the current emergency , we approached from two angles .
”
“
Yeah , ” the Junior Captain said .   
Her voice was level .   
“ Tell them we ’ve got one too .
”
“ We ’ve got one too , ” the guy said , into the phone .   
“
We ’ve got two , actually .
”
I looked where he was looking .   
It was Capricorn .
“
Oh , I know you , ” the junior captain said .   
“ Capricorn , right ?
”
“
Yeah , ” Capricorn said .
“
You ’re a hero .   
You ’ve been active out there .   
Somewhere near Fairfield ?
”
“ Cedar Point .   
She ’s a hero too .
”
“
And Sveta , ” I said .
“
Yeah , ” he said .   
“
If my word counts for anything .
”
The suspicion wavered , and then it gave .   
She held the gun in one hand , and reached for the phone with the other .
So many hurdles .   
But the captain communicated the situation , and she communicated my suggestion about the people being evacuated .   
The patrol squad went for another patrol , and they talked to people .
“
All stations are evacuating for now , ” Junior Captain Eads said .   
She ’d eased up considerably , after her superiors had gotten the okay .   
“ Trains are stopped , emergency staff is being called in .   
Heroes are in .
”
Looksee arrived almost ten minutes later .   
We were still lingering near the doors , so Looksee sat on the bottom stair , getting out her computer .   
Capricorn crouched by her in a position I would ’ve been hard pressed to maintain before my legs started complaining , and I was n’t wearing plated armor .
“
No word from Tattletale ?
”
“
Two words .   
She said ‘ on it’ .   
I do n’t think she likes me much , ” Looksee said .
“ I did paint her as a pretty horrible person , did n’t I ?
”
“
Ha , ” Looksee said , without humor .   
“
We ’ve got our targets on camera , see ?
”
Capricorn spoke out of the side of his mouth , while crouched near Looksee .   
“
Maybe do n’t announce that we ’re tapped into their security while their people with guns and cops are ten feet away .
”
Two women and six men at two separate tables .   
No costumes .   
The restaurant was emptying .   
There was one member of the staff walking around , cleaning tables .   
Maybe a manager .
Keeping up the facade ?   
Heroes came in all forms .
What the hell were they up to ?
A private message window popped up in the corner .   
Tattletale .
Tattletale : 

call logs .
ur right .
they r hitting every station with a portal 

I let people know .
Every station .   
My heart skipped a beat .
I looked over at Captain Eads .   
She was staring at me , looking alarmed .
“
They ’re hitting all of the stations .
”
“ Every one with a portal , ” I said .
“
They ’re shutting us down .   
Closing us off .
”
“ Capricorn , ” Looksee said .   
“ Victoria .
”
She had our attention .
Tattletale : 

tinkr devices .
they all have one .
under chairs in bags .
hit them b4
they can use It was a message to us , but from the reaction , I had the sense the message was going out to every team and station .
I adjusted my costume , flipping up my hood .   
Capricorn stood .   
Looksee drew her flash gun .   
Patrol soldiers had their weapons out .   
Older soldiers were jogging over from one of the other entrances .   
Leaders for this particular exercise .
“
Their parahuman wants to be the one to make the first move , ” one soldier said .
“
Who ?
”
“
The girl with the painted armor .
”
“ Sveta .   
Let me set up , and I ’m all for it , ” Capricorn said .
The minutes that followed were silence punctuated by bursts of movement so intense that it felt like the situation had just erupted .   
Boots on the ground , as patrol officers went to one wing or another .   
Then laughter , somewhere , eerily out of tune with the feeling we had near the entrance .   
Fake , to create a sense of normalcy , when the groups at the table might be noticing how quiet things were getting ?
At every station , there had to be a situation like this unfolding .
We had no idea who these guys were .   
They might ’ve been friends of the Fallen , but that was open - ended .
“
Going , ” Capricorn ’s voice came over the phone , a whisper made loud .
I was looking around the corner as Sveta went around the corner across from me , entering the hallway , snapping over to the entrance to the restaurant , and disappearing inside .
Capricorn came back in from outside at a run .   
I flew in , and the officers were ready behind me .
I was just in time to see Sveta skidding on the floor .   
She spied the target and grabbed it where it apparently sat on the booth seat beside one of the people at the table , and hauled it to her with enough force that it produced a spatter of blood when it clipped the face of the guy sitting by it .
Then she was out , case in hand , and we were in .   
A restaurant with red , white , and black tile , black booths , and pretty looking tables .   
It was cold on the one side because windows were open , and noticeably warm on the other because heat radiated from the kitchen .
Sabrina was one , or another Fallen with Crowley genes was .   
When she used her power , she clarified the point- a shimmering bubble around herself , wet with waves rolling , overlapping and crashing around it .   
Energy shimmered and danced wherever two waves met .
Beside her , someone was using a changer power , manifesting bone armor and a long limb at their right hip .   
Possibly a whip .
Someone shot Sabrina .   
I carried right past her to the changer , and hit it hard enough to shatter the bone armor and send them sprawling .   
Capricorn used his power , and water came in through the open windows , flooding the restaurant and knocking just about everyone at the far end off their feet .   
All members of the other group .
It was n’t a pretty fight .   
It was n’t even an exciting fight .   
It was a trap closing , where I was the jaws of the mousetrap slamming down , Capricorn was the pitfall and the bucket of water they were unceremoniously forced to deal with .   
Sveta was the snare .
Even with a bullet in her , Sabrina used her power anew , surrounding herself and her teammates .   
Her teammates rose up , each one flying within the bubble , with double images forming around each .   
Other things were lifted as well- tables and chairs .
People took shots .   
Most hit the strategically placed and doubled furniture .
Sabrina fired a handgun from behind cover .   
One shot , and I heard four impacts as the shots landed .   
Passing through or traveling through the bubble , the bullets were multiplied .
I had the Wretch pick up a table as I flew .   
It was my shield , above and beyond what the Wretch offered .   
I rammed into the floating cover Sabrina had erected around her people and drove that cover into them .   
One flew back and away , stunned , and had a tentacle grab them from the window behind them .
It was my means of taking Sabrina ’s booth that she was using as cover and , overturning the table that had been damaged by wretch and bullet alike , place it over her head , capping her in the booth .
She had to fly out , floating in her bubble , moving low to the ground .   
Anticipating her , I flew to meet her , diving and putting my foot where mirror images overlapped .   
I kicked her chest - first into the floor , and I could hear the clack of her teeth as her chin met the floor a fraction of a second later .
We ’d left little room for counterplay .   
No room for proper reactions , beyond the wild and desperate attempt to fight back .
Just like that , it was over .
Nobody who knew anything relaxed .   
The captains called in that we ’d succeeded .   
The confirmation came back .   
All looked good .   
All clear from Looksee and Tattletale .   
Sveta handed the tinker case to a professional .
Everyone who knew something about the situation remained ready , waiting for the next shoe to drop .
“
Good work , ”
Junior Captain Eads said .
There was nowhere to go .   
Nothing to do .   
We ’d done our job , the people with the know - how were interrogating who they could find , and answers would come soon .
But the answers had to wait .   
The other stations- well , they had to handle their own stuff .   
The closest portal to us was really Brockton Bay , and Brockton Bay was n’t that close .   
Our station was busy with cleanup , with questions and no answers .   
We were in the way , and we could n’t go elsewhere to help because things would be over before we arrived .
We had nowhere to go except- almost by silent agreement , we made our way outside .
As Vince Crowley had wanted to do , we found a vantage point to watch the horizon .
The messages began coming in on phones .
“ Norwalk station , ” Kenzie said .
“
That ’s your neighborhood , ” Sveta replied .
Kenzie nodded .   
She was typing quickly .   
“
My parents look okay .   
Reports are coming in .   
The sky- a slice of pink ?   
I do n’t get it .   
Things seem mostly fine .   
What happened ?
”
“
Hey , ” Capricorn said .   
He touched Sveta ’s shoulder .   
“ Look .
”
Off to the north .
Brockton Bay could n’t catch a break .   
It was like a shard of glass or a torn piece of painting .   
I could see the sky on the other side .   
The world beyond .
They were opening the portals wider .   
Taller .   
A portal that large- it had to have sliced Brockton Bay in half .   
What did that impact ?   
What did it do ?
We ’d have to take off-
where ?
We had somewhere to go now , yet we were paralyzed .   
The phone had a list of portals , now , and one by one , the gray rectangles turned green with checkmarks , or were marked with red ‘ x ’s .
One by one , places were deemed okay or thrust into new crisis .   
The city had barely been holding up as it was .
Green .   
Green .   
Green .   
Red .   
Green .   
Red …
I stopped focusing on the successes and failures , and turned my attention to my contact list .   
Crystal .   
Gilpatrick .   
Dad .   
Mom .
I sent the messages and waited for the replies .   
In the times between waits , I typed out hurried explanations , as far as we had any .   
It seemed like hours were passing
and it seemed like no time at all was passing
and we were stuck in a horrible , unresolved moment for an eternity .
On the horizon , another slice of sky that was n’t overcast , in the midst of sunset .   
A spear or blade of the wrong light , cast across a community .
A reply from Crystal .   
Her team would be out and helping , as soon as they knew what was going on .   
If this opened the doors wide for Earth C … what would we even do ?
Fight .
Mom was okay .   
She told me that Amy was okay , and I let her .   
Dad was fine .   
Gilpatrick , Jasper , Ashley and Rain were okay .
No response from Weld .
New York was the central hub because it was the place with the densest cluster of portals .   
The phone noted several failures in that area .
No response from the Wardens .   
They would be getting bombarded .   
Maybe it was that .
Hard to convince myself of that ,
but I tried .   
If three portals failed , what happened ?   
Did they open so wide that each intersected with the others ?   
What happened to something caught in the middle ?
No response from Fume Hood or Tempera .
Crystalclear was well .   
He ’d been manning one station , and his group had succeeded in finding and catching the person who had brought the tinker device there .   
The portal widening device .
I stood , unable to keep sitting , my phone still in my in hand .   
Sveta sat with Kenzie , the two of them looking at the same phone .   
Capricorn was off to the side , sitting against a wall .   
Chris typed .
A response from Weld , brief , and Sveta burst into tears .   
I sat down next to her to hug her .   
When she stood up a minute later , pacing , I remained where I was , keeping an eye on Kenzie and an eye on my phone .
There was an agitation that was taking over .   
I could see it in everyone ’s body language .
Phones here
and there beeped , people scrolled .
Only the anxiety .
It was n’t quite true , I knew , but I imagined it all the same .   
That we could n’t bring ourselves to raise the subject , but we were all doing the same things at the same time anyway .    
We sat and we poked at our phones , and we convinced ourselves it was n’t true
, we stabbed fingers at the phone with more vigor , as if that could somehow get through and evoke a response .   
We searched , told ourselves it was a congested network , and held off on sending messages while hoping for one more .   
The realization settled in , and it was n’t the good kind of settling .
Each and every one of us had one name in common , someone they cared about , and for some , one of the only responsible adult figures who cared about them in turn .   
She had every reason to be right at the epicenter , which did n’t make it better .








I gripped until my fingernails threatened to penetrate the skin , squeezing , strangling , until my hand hurt and my bullet wound hurt more .   
The pain in the bullet wound intensified , until the muscle started to cramp .
“ Relax .
”
Relaxing my grip was a thing I had to tell myself how to do , more than pushing on through the pain had been .   
I released the stress ball with the doofy character face on the front .   
Bloodshot eyes receded into sockets and the mouth closed to settle into the infuriating little grin .   
My handprint remained as an indent on the ball ’s thin skin , slowly disappearing .
“
Agh , ”
I made a sound .   
The cramping feeling in my arm was n’t going away .   
It was like a charlie horse , but more intense than any I ’d had .
“
Are you okay ?   
Was it too much ?
”   
She gingerly touched my arm , being shy of the wound , and felt out the muscle .   
“
Let me know if this hurts .
” I nodded , because I could n’t really talk .   
The massage helped .   
It did hurt , when the fingers pulled against skin closer to the bullet wound , but the massage soothed the cramp enough that the pain was worth enduring .
“ I was n’t sure if you were using super strength or if it was you , ” she said .
Then ask , I thought , the pain sharpening thoughts that might not have been so sharp five minutes ago or five minutes from now .
“
Well , it seems like you have good strength in your hands .
”
“ It does n’t feel strong , ” I said .
“
Okay .   
Not to worry !   
That ’s something we can work on .
”
Anne Lynn was my physical therapist with a first and middle name that she ’d insisted were to be used together because she was not an ‘ Anne’
and she definitely was n’t a ‘ Lynn’ .   
Okay , fine .   
Going by first impressions , she seemed to be a lovely , warm , caring person who was painfully new to what she was doing .   
She went to her mentor , who was in our mostly empty activity area , for things I did n’t imagine really needed clarification or reassurance .   
She did much the same for me , double - checking what I said in a way that made me think she was n’t taking me at my word .
It seemed she also did n’t ask for clarification at times she needed it .
She was a hard person to really dislike or resent , though .   
She was shorter than average , cute and bubbly , and her smile seemed persistent and genuine .   
That was a hard thing to find , given recent events .
“
No super strength , for the record , ” I said .   
“
I turned it off .   
It kind of defeats the point , does n’t it ?
”
“ We should make sure that works as you heal , ” she said .
“
It ’s not a concern , ” I said .   
“
I could be the strongest or weakest person in the world and it wo n’t affect how my super strength works .
”
“
Oh ?   
Okay , got it .   
If you ’re sure .
”
There it was .   
The vague impression she doubted me .   
Was I being unfair ?
“ If you keep me talking about this
I ’m going to go full powers geek on you , ” I said .
She snorted .   
“
That ’s convincing .   
Oh no , please do n’t tell me about your power or show me anything neat !
”
“ Ahhh , ” I said .   
So she ’d hoped to see something .   
I thought about how much she did n’t want to see my uncontrolled forcefield in action , and I smiled anyway .   
“
Maybe sometime .
”
“ Sometime , if you ’re comfortable doing it .   
But not today , our session is just about over .    
How ’s your arm feeling ?
”
I tried moving it .   
The cramp had mostly subsided .   
“ Better . ”
She smiled , reaching for the shelf under the bench I was sitting on .   
Papers and plastic bags rustled .   
She put a pile of stuff beside me .   
“
I have stuff for you .
”
“ Homework .
”
“
Some !   
Papers , this one has your instructions for your physiotherapy you can do at home .   
We want to keep up your hand , wrist , elbow and shoulder strength while letting your arm recover .   
This paper here has some recommended tips for recovery and pain .   
On the backside , we have some things to watch out for .
”
“ Neuromas , muscle cramps lasting for long periods of time , persistent fever , swelling that appears suddenly or does n’t let up .   
Got it .
”
“ If any exercises are too painful for you to do , make a note .   
I ’ll see you in two days and you can tell me then .   
We ’ll figure out if there ’s something wrong or if it ’s something we want you to work through .   
If I do n’t know for sure then I ’ll talk to someone who does .   
We ’ll meet two days after that session , then scale down to twice a week after that , and once a week toward the end .
”
“
My doctor told me I should expect two to four more weeks recovery .
”
“
That ’s for the muscle damage .   
Longer with the bone healing , but my notes say that was minor .   
I printed this out for you .   
Bone fracture healing is explained on this sheet .   
I included a copy of the list your doctor gave for the supplements to take .   
Okay , that ’s all the papers .   
We have some slings for you- various colors and styles .
”
A sling .   
Ugh .   
“ Great .
”
“ And finally , a bag of rubber bands for some of the hand exercises
and-
” she paused , raising a bag filled with colorful stress balls .   
“ Stress helpers !   
We have a variety !
”
There was a part of me that wanted to groan at the forced cheer , and at the even more forced use of ‘ helper’ .   
I went with it , maintaining a smile and peering at the bag .   
It was n’t worth making her an adversary .
“
We have the faces , Grimace Gus , Dopey Dan , Pinhead Pam , and a few others .   
I have a few of these myself .   
You can pick one to represent someone you hate and channel that emotion into getting better .
”
No blonde Smug Susans .   
Too bad .
Hearing Anne Lynn get so excited over little toys helped me put my finger on her image and way of presenting herself .   
She made me think of a kindergarten teacher .   
I could imagine her hyping up a class of munchkins with the same attitude she ’d shown around me .
I poked the bag .  
It was a resealable bag , but it was old enough that it had crinkled and scuffed to the point it was foggy .   
“
You have a few of these , huh ?   
Do you have a Grimace Gus in your life ?
”
“ I do , ” Anne Lynn said .   
“
But it ’s mostly the Dopey Dan and Pinhead Pam that give me grief .   
Family .
”
“
Ah .   
I hear you on that .
”   
I liked her a little more than I had , hearing that .   
I peered at the bag .
“ We have other things , like the animal balls .   
Let ’s see … beetle , ick , the bird , the snake ,
the lion- ”
“ Lion , ”    I said .
“
Do you want to check the bag ?   
There are others .
”
“
The lion would be great , thank you , ” I said .   
“
I had a childhood toy that was a lion .
”
“
Perfect , ” she proclaimed , while retrieving the lion .   
It was just a head , with two black dots for eyes , no mouth , and the mane taking up three quarters of it , with ears poking up on top .   
“
Your therapy partner for when you ’re not with me .   
Treat each other well .
”
There was a part of me that felt like she was treating me like a kid , but that might have been her usual demeanor .   
I could have rankled at it or said something , and I did n’t .   
Another part of me that felt very tired , and that part of me welcomed having a stress doll that reminded me of the stuffed toy I ’d loved to the point it had looked monstrous .   
That tired part of me almost welcomed the cheer and the being taken care of .
Picking my sling was a little less interesting than picking the stress ball .   
I tried on two and went with the most comfortable , holding it instead of putting it on .   
I said my farewell to Anne Lynn and walked past others who were in the midst of their own exercises at parallel bars , benches , and weight machines .
One woman with tan skin , black and gray exercise clothing and her hair in a bun was at the weight machines .   
She gave me a nasty look .   
I had no idea who she might be .
I dropped my stuff off at my locker , then made use of the shower that was adjacent to the therapy area .   
It was n’t that I ’d worked up a serious sweat , but I had n’t slept well , and so I ’d flown around before my appointment , checking that all was well .
All was n’t well .
Rinsing off gave me a chance to refresh myself , resetting to zero , and it allowed me to change my clothes .   
What I wore for a doctor ’s appointment and preliminary therapy session was n’t going to serve for the rest of the day .   
Once I ’d dried off , I put on a top with a collar that had a fine gold zipper instead of buttons , chosen because it was easy to put on with an injured arm .   
I pulled on a pair of olive slacks that served as good all - purpose pants .   
The pants proved to be less of a stellar choice with two stubborn buttons that needed doing up , but they were business casual and they ’d survive if a fight broke out , which I was n’t quite ruling out .
I stopped at the mirror to braid my damp hair as best as I could with the one hand , taking my time to do it , and then put a bit of makeup on around my eyes .   
I was mid - application when the woman with the bun who ’d given me a dirty look passed through the shower room , walking behind me and into the locker room , eyeing me as she passed .
I almost said hi .   
Maybe I would in the future .
I got my things , put them in a bag , took a minute to situate my arm in the sling , and situated my bag on my other arm .
Leaving the building , I left the smell of sweat made muggy by showers behind me and ventured into the cool outdoors , closing my eyes against the cold sun .   
Opening those eyes , I saw the gold - tinted city and a mostly blue sky that would have been pleasant in any other circumstance .
Pleasant if the horizon had n’t been shattered like a dropped mirror .   
The sky was divided , with vague shapes stabbing up into it , the sky on the far side taking on different tints and weather .
The portals had n’t been flat doors that things could pass through , but three dimensional objects , transition points with rules that we ’d simplified by driving trains straight through them .   
Nothing about it was simple now .
Four portals in this area of the city had been drawn out to a height taller than our tallest buildings , and expanded out to encompass multiple city blocks .   
The fourth had been a surprise by a parahuman that had used a power to hide until the heat had died down .   
The worst expansion covered twelve blocks , and it would have covered more if it had n’t been close to the water .
At the edges of those portals , buildings and one bridge had collapsed .   
Within the areas encompassed ?   
We still did n’t know .   
The portals had expanded out , bled into one another to surround one of the more critical areas of the city , because that area had been centered to be symbolically near the largest cluster of portals , and they ’d scrambled .   
They did n’t point to where they once had .
I checked the coast was clear enough that I would n’t scare anyone , and I took flight .
The bugs in the city were bad , stubborn even as the weather was cooling down .   
It had been that way for a while , but the spring and fall seemed worst .   
They had n’t gotten the message yet , that the city was here and wildlife and insect life needed to move elsewhere .   
Now , though , we had wind .   
Different earths had different weather and we had gaping holes in our city with starkly different pressures on one side than we had on the other .   
Flying , I could feel it .
I could feel it more as I flew over the portals , to the point that I was course correcting more than I was flying forward .   
Crosswinds .   
If my hair had n’t been in a braid , it would have been all over me .
In the center of the portals , three separate doors sloshed together .   
The Wardens headquarters had been there .   
Key members and staff of the three sub - teams and the Wardens themselves had been stationed there when it had all gone to hell .   
Jessica had been working late .
Option one suggested that they ’d been torn to shreds , caught by three portals that were clashing together and switching what world they were connected to moment by moment , until they finally stopped expanding and settled .
Option two might have been worse .   
The Wardens’ head office had been serving as a place to sequester dangerous capes .   
Slaughterhouse Nine , ex - Birdcage capes , international enemies , and Class - S threats like Nilbog .   
Even the ones who had been cooperating had been kept under close guard because cooperation did n’t necessarily equate trust .
If Jessica and the other late - evening staff at the Wardens’ HQ were out there , stranded somewhere after the portals swallowed the area up , then they were n’t in good company .   
I imagined it ending up something like the Lord of the Flies , if the talking severed pig ’s head was the least fucked up around .
It was n’t a good imagining .
Construction crews were working to mend the damage .   
Building had n’t even begun on the structures that might contain the portal .   
It was a herculean undertaking , even with powers helping .
Even after I returned to the streets , the wind was something I noticed , a constant gust that was either coming or going from the direction of the disaster .
Life moved on like normal but the cold wind blew hard .   
People on the street kept their heads down and walked briskly , even less likely to make eye contact or offer a kind word than they had been before this .   
Businesses were the same , when they were open .   
That was saying something , considering this area was the closest thing we had to New York .
Brockton Bay , when I ’d paid a visit , had been similar enough .   
It had been more of a slice , cutting the city and its industry in two , leaving one half without power or internet .   
The attitude shift had been felt there too .
All of the affected areas .   
The affected areas of the city felt like ghost towns that were n’t empty nor were they towns .   
The warmth was n’t there , there was n’t a soul or community , and everything felt eerie .   
Too new , too worn out for how new they were , insects clustered on warm surfaces , and too many businesses were closed with all lights off , despite their posted hours .
It was no surprise that I arrived early at the meeting place and yet Kenzie had beaten me there .   
She was at the table with her laptop , hair immaculate , and what looked like a set of two individual hair pins that were each one part of a heart , the heart split down the middle by a crack .   
She wore both halves , the pins set in her hair so the cracks meshed .   
I was n’t sure if it was meant to be a ‘ BFF’ style thing where each friend wore one , or if she was supposed to wear each pin on one side of her head .   
She wore a maroon dress with a pattern of black scribbled hearts , and black tights .
Her dad stood by .   
He wore a long peacoat , one side of the collar turned up against the wind .   
His hair had pulled away in strands that swayed with the wind .
The patio area was otherwise empty .   
The business it served was closed .   
There were n’t that many people on the street .
“
Victoria is here , ” he said .
Kenzie sat up to peer over the top of the screen , her eyes large .
“
You ’re early , ” I said .   
I sat in the chair across from her , scooting it over
so I could see past the laptop to her , and see Julien standing behind her .   
Considering we were nearly as close as we could get to the city center without being able to see the base of the portals , there were n’t many people around .
“ I like seeing people arrive places .   
When they arrive and where they sit tells you things .
”
“
Does it ?
”
“
Yep .   
People sit closer to people they have an affinity with .
It ’s not always people they like , but it ’s usually people they relate to .   
And whether you ’re a boy or girl matters .   
Girls tend to sit next to others or across from others , but guys sit diagonally across .   
Once you start noticing it , you ’ll see it all over the place .   
It ’s a puzzle .
”
“ You like that kind of thing , huh ?
”
She nodded .
I leaned back into the back corner of my chair , the armrest and the wall beside me supporting me as much as the chair back did .
“
How ’s your arm ?
” she asked .   
She closed her laptop and turned it over , pressing her hands down on the warm underside .
“
Doctor said it ’s healing well .   
I ’ll spare you the gorier details .   
Physio started today .
”
“
What happened ?
” Julien asked .
“ I told you this stuff , dad , ” Kenzie said .
“ When you tell me things it comes in a stream .   
I pick out what I can .
”
“ I got shot , ” I said .   
“
In and out .   
I had to have two fragments of bone removed .
”
“ I ’ve been shot , ” Julien said .   
“
Twice .   
Except I did n’t get physio or doctor
’s appointments after .
”
“
I only know about the once , ” Kenzie said .
“ Both before she was born , ” Julien told me .   
“
I grew up in a neighborhood where you either went to a gang or the gang came for you .   
I went to them when I was twelve , they raised me .   
I got shot once while working for them , and once when I left and did n’t keep it secret enough .
”
“
I only heard about the second one , ” Kenzie said .
“ Why did you leave ?
” I asked .
“ If you asked me then , I would have said there were different middle managers .   
Now ?   
Was n’t me .
”
“
You said you were good at it , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Sales .
”
“
Mm hmm , ” Julien said .   
“
It was n’t good for me .
”
“ I can respect that , ” I said .   
“ Leaving .   
That ca n’t have been easy .
”
“
Thank you , ” he said .   
He looked down at Kenzie .   
“
Was she at any risk ?
”
“ Dad .
”
“ Minimal to no risk , ” I said .   
“ Given how everything went last week , it might have been riskier for her to stay home .
”
“ My wife invited you over , but with everything that happened and the station exploding near our home , you ’ll need to give us a few days to get organized .
”
“
It ’s a mess , ” I said .
Julien nodded .   
His hand rose to his chin as he stroked his beard .   
His eyes were on the distance , first on the shattered horizon , and then on the street .   
“
I ca n’t tell which one that is .
”
I turned to look , wincing as my elbow banged the chair back .
I could n’t tell who it was either .   
He walked with confidence , head high , but his hair had no paint or dye , and it was combed neat .   
He wore a vest over a button - up top .   
A lot about that image seemed to convey ‘ Tristan’ , but the lack of color and the more serious expression did n’t .   
He seemed to have Tristan ’s build , but the cut of the outfit could have created that illusion .   
It was a nice suit , minus the suit jacket .
“ Victoria .   
Kenzie .   
Good to see you two .   
Mister Martin , ” he said , as he arrived at the table .   
By voice and manner of speaking ?   
That was Tristan .
“ Tristan , ” Julien Martin replied .   
He put a hand on Kenzie ’s chair back .   
“ Kenzie .   
You wanted me to stay until people came ?
”
“ You can go , dad .   
Thank you for sticking around .
”
He gave us a nod , and with hands in the pocket of his coat , he walked to his car , which was in what should have been a heavily contested parking spot .
Kenzie smiled , giving me a shrug .   
“ Sorry .
”
“
Why sorry ?
” I asked .
“
He ’s embarrassing .
”
“ You pick the weirdest words , ” Tristan said .
“ Embarrassing does n’t feel like the most accurate fit .
”
“
What do you think about him , then ?
” she asked .   
She leaned forward , hands still on her laptop .
“ I- ” I started .   
“
Is it undiplomatic to say he gives me a weird vibe ?
”
“
No , ” Tristan said , settling into his chair .
“
No , ” Kenzie said .   
The smile fell from her face .   
“
I give off a weird vibe , too .   
I had to get it from somewhere , so obviously I overachieved and got a full share from each of my parents .
”
“
Speaking of overachieving and casual segues away from uncomfortable topics , ” Tristan said .   
“ I like the saintly laying - on - hands you ’re doing for your laptop there .   
That ’s a new thing .
”
“
It ’s warm and my hands are cold , duh .
”
“
Of course .   
Too bad , I liked the image of you as technology Jesus .
”
She closed her eyes , leaning back , and hummed .   
She kept her eyes closed as she stopped humming , and said , “ I wish I actually got to go to Church enough that I could know something fancy to say .
”
“
I ’m not much of a memorizer , ” Tristan said .   
“
Most of what I could tell you is what I remember from choir .   
I could give you Byron , but I do n’t know how he ’d feel about that .
”
“
No , it ’s okay .   
Not a big deal , ” Kenzie said .
Chris was making his way down the street .   
Where Tristan had been confident and well dressed , Chris wore a sweatshirt and ducked his head .   
He had the headphones on , but not the braces .   
He looked very much like a thirteen year old boy , down to the sullen look in his eyes .
“
What the hell , Tristan ?   
I feel underdressed , ” Chris said .
“ You dressed up a little , ” Kenzie said .   
“
No braces .   
It ’s nice .
”
“
No braces because I have back to back dentist appointments , ” Chris said .   
He put one finger at the corner of his mouth , yanking it back to show his teeth .   
The mounts for the braces were still on the teeth , and two of the teeth were missing .   
A canine and the molar behind it , at the top .
“ You changed too much , ” Tristan made it a statement and not a question .
“
And I got dry socket .   
I ’m fucking miserable .
”
“
You should n’t change too much .
”
“
Oh yes , thank you Tristan .   
I completely forgot .   
I need and want to change , in case you forgot .   
Like right now , I want to get back home and change into a puddle of flesh with no nerve endings or teeth .   
But we ’re doing this instead .
”
“
We ’re just missing Sveta , ” I said .
“
The only person without a phone .   
Great , ” Chris said .
“ The trains are down so getting here is tough .   
I know it sucks , but stick it out , ” I said .
“
Do you have any fun painkillers your doctor prescribed you ?
”
“ I have some .   
I ’m not going to give them to a minor who did n’t have them prescribed to him .   
Do you want a boring over - the - counter painkiller instead ?
”
Chris nodded , and I got a bottle from my bag , passing it across the table to him .
He tipped four or five pills into his hand and before I could get an accurate count or realize what he was doing , tossed them back into his mouth , swallowing them dry .
“ Chris !
”
“
Fuck off , ” he said .   
“
I know my physiology
and I know
what I ’m doing .
”
“ You keep saying that , ” I said .   
“
It sounds less convincing each time .
”
“ Chris ! ”
Kenzie said .   
“
Do you know any good prayers
I could say over my laptop ?   
It ’s a thing we were talking about .
”
“
Do I strike you as the churchgoing type ?
”
“
Nothing ?
”
“ Some random latin .   
Ex nihilo nihil fit , I think is a good phrase for you .
”
“
Why do I feel like you just insulted me ?
” Kenzie asked .
“
It ’s not insulting , nimrod .   
It ’s actually a compliment .
”
“
Aww ! ”
“
Which I ’m regretting now .
”
“ I ’m struck between the fact that you know that , first of all , ” I said .
“ I spend a lot of time reading when I ’m waiting out a form .
”
“
And the fact you ’re doubling down on the moody teenage boy thing .   
Most just get into nihilism , but you fit two ‘ nihil’ in one sentence there .   
What is that ?   
Word , nothing , nothing , word ?
”
“
Why do I even talk ?
”
Chris asked , leaning back .   
He pulled his hood down over his eyes .
Sveta arrived , spotting us before jogging to us in an ungainly way that made me worry she might fall .   
She did n’t crash to the ground , but she did teeter , and stopped , her hand resting against a window to catch her balance .
She wore long sleeves , a new wig , and her body was scrubbed of paint .   
Her dress was long , layered in stages of darkening green from layer to layer , with shapes cut out of each lower portion .   
Fish or leaves , it looked like .
“
I love the dress , ” I said .
“
Oh , this ?   
It was a gift from Chief Armstrong , ” she said .   
“
I ’m
sorry
I ’m
late .
”
“
It ’s fine , ” I said .   
“
I do n’t think we ’re all late .
” She smiled .   
“
I ’m weirdly nervous .
”
“
It ’s a weird thing , ” Tristan said .
It was a weird thing .   
In timing and place , in atmosphere , and in aim and objective .
The wind whipped around us as the five of us walked as a group .   
There were n’t any crowds , and the building was largely empty as we made our way inside .   
The interior of the building was dim , but it was mostly because the lights were off and illumination came from the windows to the outside .
“
No word on Mrs. Yamada ?
” Tristan asked .
“
No , ” Sveta said .   
“ Not according to Weld .
”
“
And we do n’t know who was behind it ?
”
“
Not yet , ” I said .
There were some simple folding chairs lined up down the wide hallway .   
Either end of the building had large windows , which let the light come in , casting its long , vague shadows .   
Some people were already in the hallway , clustered in groups .
There was a man sitting alone who gave me a curious look as we looked for a spot to situate the five of us .   
He was the kind of guy I might have imagined as a kid ’s baseball coach , with a bit of a belly , short hair , and a soft expression with lines in the forehead .   
As easygoing as he looked in the moment , I could imagine him getting really intense in the right occasion .
He stood when he saw me , and that got my attention .
I left the group to approach him .
“
Do I know you ?
”
“
Not yet , ” he said .   
Before he continued , I was already placing his voice from the phone .   
“
We had an appointment today .   
I ’m Dr. Darnall .
”
“
Oh , ” I said .   
I felt momentarily awkward and weirded out both .   
“
I ’m sorry to reschedule on you .
”
“
It ’s fine , ” he said .   
“
Both reschedules were for very good reasons .
”
Outpatient surgery and this .
“
You ’re here , though .
”
“
I was asked to consult , ” he said .   
“ When you rescheduled to attend , I realized the connection to this .   
I thought I ’d look in and see how he made out , and get our first meeting out of the way , so you do n’t have to worry about it .
”
“ I ’m not worried , ” I said .   
“
I ’m just trying to work out a lot of things , and timing gets awkward .
”
“ Absolutely , ” he said .   
He had an easygoing tone .   
“ Is that the team you ’re looking after ?
”
“
Kind of .   
They ’re not so much a team anymore , but I do want to look after them .
”
The group was all together , talking , with Sveta being the one to look momentarily exasperated .   
Each one of them was glancing my way now and again , checking on me .   
When the door opened , they would look , waiting to see if we ’d see Rain or Ashley .
“
Understood , ” he said .
“
They ’re catching up after a week of everyone going their own way .
”
“ You do n’t need to justify or explain , Victoria .   
These things are complicated .   
If you want to talk about it someday , we can .   
If you do n’t want to talk , that ’s fine too .
”
“ I ’d rather they had therapists than I had one , ” I said .
“
I ’d like it if they had therapists too , but I do n’t have the room in my schedule .   
When the plane is going down , it ’s important to put your own oxygen mask on first .   
If we ca n’t address all of their issues , we can at least help you enough that you can help them .   
If you want .
”
“
Mrs. Yamada- you know her , right ?
”
“ I do .   
We were friends .   
I attended her cousin
’s wedding with her .   
As a friend of hers .
”
Weird to think about .   
I ’d never heard mention of a cousin .
“
She thought something really bad was going on with this group .   
It could be really serious .
”
“
Yeah , ” he said .   
He glanced at the window , where the shattered skyline was visible in the distance .   
A damaged building still stood , but with a chunk missing .   
The girders and beams stabbed out into the gap left by the missing chunk .   
Black bones and a tinted yellow exterior .   
“
She seemed very worried about something .   
She did n’t confide in me about it .   
I ca n’t think of many others she would have talked to .
”
“
It ’s on my mind , ” I said .
The door opened .   
I glanced at it , checking to see if it was Rain or Ashley .   
It was n’t .   
It was a middle - aged woman with glasses .
“ Rain Frazier , ” she said .
People began filing in .   
The others made way for others to pass while looking in my direction .
“ I wo n’t get in your way , ” he said .   
“
I ’ll be in the back , seeing how I ’ll have to leave .   
I have an appointment with a patient in ten minutes .
”
“
It was nice to meet you , ” I said .   
“
Sorry for rescheduling .
”
“ I work with superheroes and supervillains .   
Some stay up all night , others run off to manage crises partway through most sessions .   
A couple of reschedules is n’t a blip on my radar .
”
“ You still came to find me .
”
He shrugged .   
“
My clients rub off on me .   
Sometimes you ca n’t limit yourself to chasing after or staking out and waiting .
”
“ Getting out ahead of the problem , ” I said .
“ If you want to put it that way , ” he said .
I nodded .
The others were waiting for me , so I ducked my head in a quick farewell and went to join them .
It was n’t a courtroom , but there was a layout that echoed one .   
A series of tables had people behind them .   
A woman from the Wardens that had been there when we ’d pitched our response to the Fallen hit , then others I did n’t know .   
An old man , another .
Ashley was sitting in one of the chairs off to one side , and so we all joined her , filing in to sit around her .
Rain sat past the divider , facing down the tribunal .   
He ’d cut his hair .
With us , Ashley looked the same .   
Kenzie sat beside her , her head leaning on Ashley ’s shoulder .








“ Rain , would you please stand ?
”
Rain stood , his chair scraping , the man beside him remained seated , attention and pen on a pad of lined paper in front of him .   
Two women and three men sat at the end of the room .   
It was a fairly handsome , clean - shaven twenty - something year old in a suit and tie who was doing the formal stuff , it seemed .   
The guy put more attention into his grooming and styling his longer blond hair than anyone else at the table had put into theirs , the woman from the Wardens possibly excepted .
“
Today we ’ll be addressing the case of Rain F , that ’s R - A - I - N , full name redacted , case number seven - seven - one - one - two to pass our desks here at the Meadows - Corona office .   
Rain is a minor at seventeen years of age , and his middle and last names will be redacted and abbreviated , respectively .
”
Fat lot of good it would do to trim his name when it was as unique as it was .
“
Our intention today is not to sentence , but to assess if the case is worthy of the court ’s attention .   
Spoiler , there are charges of manslaughter , so it probably is .   
Our secondary duty today is to decide what we ’ll do with the person or people in question in the time between now and when the courts can see them .   
Have you sought or been provided with counsel , Rain ?
”
“ I was provided with counsel , yes .
”
There was a pause .   
The stenographer shifted her keyboard on her desk at the side of the table and it squeaked as it moved .
“
To summarize , Rain was one of many to submit himself to the custody of the patrol block when the independent farming settlement outside of New Haven was raided .   
Both heroes and villains were on the scene , with members of the patrol block supporting the heroes .
”
Rain hesitated , then bent down to whisper to the lawyer that sat beside him .   
The men and women at the table at the far end of the room waited until Rain straightened and raised his hand .
“
Yes ?
”   
The response came from a man with a gruff voice , a nice suit and white facial hair and hair in need of a bit of a trim .
“
Can I clarify something ?
”
“
Yes .
”
“ If we ’re summarizing , I think it ’s important to note that the compound was run by the Fallen .   
It was a cult .
”
“
Your statement will be noted , Rain , ” was the gruff response .
“
Yes , sir .
”
There were two women at the table : one was from the Wardens .   
The woman that was n’t was Hispanic , slightly overweight , and dressed a little more casually than I ’d expected for a court proctor .   
She offered a more gentle elaboration , “ This office has more than a hundred people from that settlement to process .   
To avoid bias and to be as fair as possible , we ’re not going to make any early conclusions about what it was or was n’t .   
As we address you and your situation , we ’ll hold to this idea , but we wo n’t hold you to it .   
Do you understand ?
”
“
Yes , ma’am .   
I can say things as I saw it .
”
“
Exactly , ” she said .
The second of the men went on with the formalities .   
“
On that note , to continue the summary , Rain is one of many that this office will be sorting through in the coming days and weeks .   
For easier processing , most are being addressed as groups , where the circumstances are similar .   
Rain is a unique case .
”
Hard to deny .
“ Rain is unique because , point one , he has turned himself in to the authorities with respect to a case of multiple manslaughters .   
He expressed the intention of pleading guilty .   
Some of those affected are here at the office today , and will provide testimony .
”
As Rain looked over his shoulder to glance at the people in the room , I followed his gaze .   
There were others seated , and any number of them could have been people from the mall .
“ Point two , Rain admitted to the authorities that he killed a costumed villain with his own hands , known to this office as a Jonathan Seiter , in what Rain states was self defense .
”
Snag .   
How that particular thing was addressed would impact Ashley quite a bit .   
Ashley was n’t conveying much .   
She sat with Kenzie .
“ Point three , Rain admitted to the authorities that he committed , quote , more crimes than he could count , with crimes including theft , grand theft , auto theft , vandalism , and arson .   
Much of this occurred before the end of the last calendar era , at what the individual claims was the behest of a villainous group .
”
He ’d done stuff with the Fallen between the time he was a child and the incident at the mall .
“ Point four , Rain provided information and assistance during the attack on the farming settlement outside New Haven , and this information and assistance was instrumental in mitigating damage and saving lives .
”
That was our contribution , in part .   
I ’d spent the better part of a day trying to figure out how to word my letter to the court proctors .   
It had been a distraction from the surgery I ’d had looming .
“ Point five , not unique to Rain himself , but necessary to state for the record , is the fact that he and others were under varying degrees of … how did you put it , Kimberly ?   
We did n’t write it down in the notes .
”
“
Soft mental compulsion , ” the woman from the Wardens said .   
“
Those affected were n’t controlled like a puppet , but they were under threat , much as if there was a gun to their heads or the heads of a loved one .
”
“ Thank you .   
The Wardens , corroborating witnesses and others have given us their input on this .   
It ’s a thing , this compulsion , but it ’s not a thing we can prove was in place .
”
Rain raised his hand again .
“ Rain ?
” the woman with the frumpier clothes asked .
“
I do n’t want her power to be a mitigating factor .   
I do want to make sure that woman goes to jail and stays there for a long time
, that ’s the only reason I brought it up .
”
“ Have a seat , Rain , ” the woman said .   
“
Let ’s have a conversation .
”
“
A conversation ?
” he asked .   
He took his seat .
“ I do think we want to talk about that , but let me start off by saying what our goal is here .   
When a case crosses our desk , it ’s our job to decide if it ’s worth the time of a proper court .   
If we say yes or no , that does n’t mean it ’s
a for - sure yes or no .
”
Rain nodded .
“
My personal view is to imagine four cases .   
If I put yours with them , is yours going to be the standout case ?   
Manslaughter , murder , arson , and grand theft are serious things .   
I think yours might stand out .
”
“ Yes ma’am .
”
“
You ’re turning yourself in .   
I imagine your lawyer advised you that if you kept to yourself , you might fly under the radar .   
It ’s a lot easier to recommend your case to the courts for processing if it ’s a plea .
”
“
He did tell me that .
”
“ Why turn yourself in ?
” she asked .
“
Because-
” Rain started .   
“
Before that thing at the mall happened , I was a kid , it felt like a long , unpleasant dream .   
I was raised with these people , they chose what I read and what I watched for most of my life , and I was raised in compounds like the one that was attacked last week , or in small towns , or cabins .   
Nobody really questioned , nobody said any different .   
But then the mall happened and for the first time I had to make a choice .
”
“ Elaborate , ” the man with the nice hair said .
“
I was told to guard the door of the mall .   
It was left so I could open it if I had to .   
I knew …
I knew it was a trap .   
I was threatened , told not to open it no matter
what , but I realized that if I did n’t open it then I ’d be in trouble too .   
I still did n’t open it , even when I realized people were hurt and scared .   
That ’s not okay , and I deserve to be punished .
”
“ Were you compelled ?
” Kimberly asked .
“
Um .   
By Mama Mathers , you mean ?
”
“
The soft compulsion , ” she said .   
“ Mama Mathers , yes .
”
“
She was there in the back of my head .   
You see visions of her if you think about her , and I thought about her and what she ’d do .   
She was there , then .
”
“ She can make people lose their minds if they do n’t do what she wants , ” Kimberly said .
Someone in the back stood up .
“ Sit , ” the gruff man said , annoyed .
“ You ca n’t go easy on him , ” a man said .
“ Sit .   
We will ask you to speak when your turn comes .   
If you do not take your seat and remain silent , you will be removed .
”
There was a pause as people got settled .   
There was murmuring , and a bald man at the end of the court proctor ’s table banged his cup against the table a few times , in lieu of a gavel .
When all had nearly settled , Rain said , “ I do n’t want you to go easy on me .
”
“ We want a full understanding of the situation , ” Kimberly said .   
“
She could have made you lose your mind , yes ?
”
“ Not as much as some did back at the attack on the camp .   
I had n’t talked to her recently , so it would n’t have been as strong .
”
“
Still .   
She could have .
”
“
Yes , ” Rain said .   
“
But people died and were hurt .   
I see and hear them every night in my dreams .   
I should have made the call and opened that door .
”
“ Do you think turning yourself in will make that better ?
” the frumpy woman asked .   
“
Seeing them in your dreams ?
”
“
No , ” Rain said .   
“
I do n’t see how that matters .
”
In the back , Dr. Darnall stood and left the room .
⊙ I set down on the rooftop as Dr. Darnall erected a blue patio umbrella .
“
That was quick , ” he remarked .   
“
I thought you would take a few minutes to spot it .
”
“
There are n’t that many rooftops that are that easy to lounge on , ” I said .   
“ A lot of them are in pretty scary shape , actually .   
Flying over , I see cracks and water that ’s been there long enough to have algae or something form .
”
“ That would explain the mosquito - like flies we ’ve been getting , ” he said .   
“
I ’m glad to have you here .   
Is Victoria okay , or do you prefer a cape name ?
”
“ Victoria , ” I said .
“ Victoria , ” he said .   
He reached over for a handshake , and I shook his hand .   
It was cool- probably from the recent work with the umbrella .   
“
I ’m Dr. Darnall .   
You can call me doctor , Wayne , or whatever you prefer .
”
It was hard to imagine calling him Wayne and taking him seriously .   
“ Doctor , ” I said .
“
Very well , ” he replied .
He worked with the umbrella for a bit , and I offered my assistance with my one good hand , pulling the fabric of the patio umbrella around one of the prongs .
We each settled into chairs .   
The metal was cold- even though it was only September , the weather was turning .   
There was a gravity to the seasonal change that I could n’t remember ever experiencing back home on Bet .
“
Did your friends have their turns in front of the tribunal ?
”
“
No .   
Rain had his .   
Ashley will have hers soon .   
I ’m helping her pack up her apartment tomorrow .
”
“ With one arm ?
”
“
It ’s for emotional support , as much as anything .
”
“ Drink ?
” he asked .   
He reached down and pulled a small cooler out from beneath his chair .
“ Please , ” I said .   
“
Whatever you have would be great .
”
He had an assortment of sodas , water , lemonade and iced tea .   
I took the iced tea , set it down , and got the papers out of my bag .
“
The stuff you asked me to fill out .
”
He took it , leaning back in his seat .   
It was disconcerting to deal with the silence , when I was used to one person guiding and leading conversation , steering things and making the most out of the hour and a half or however much time was set aside .
That had been back at the hospital , though , and maybe the need to fill the silence had been because I ’d been something less human .
He read through the paperwork , and put it down on the table with the last page on top .
My ‘ homework’ .   
I ’d submitted the critical information back when I ’d made my first appointment , which I ’d had to cancel for surgery .   
I ’d walked away with some information on therapy and what to expect , and this .   
Questions .
The page he ’d left on top had been the unusual exercise in the batch .   
The bottom half of the page had been left empty , but for a circle with a thick bold line .   
The instruction had been to draw , not write , how I was feeling , and to leave the paper and pen in arm
’s reach for a while before and after using the space .
I ’d settled on a face , drawing it like I might a sighing emoji , eyebrows slightly turned up in worry .   
I was n’t much of an artist .
In letting it sit , though , I ’d drawn around the perimeter of the face , lines circling the bold circle that framed the face .
I felt self - conscious about it .   
Now it sat on the table , between the two of us , the page facing nobody in particular .
“
Anything you want to get off your chest before we start ?
” he asked .   
“ Some people come to a session with something in mind .
”
“ Uh , ” I said .   
I leaned back , holding my iced tea .   
“
No , no I guess not .   
This feels pretty different from what I ’ve experienced in the past .
”
“
The therapy you got at the hospital ?
”
“
And what I saw of the session with the group , ” I said .
With Jessica .   
The rooftop seat gave me a view of the broken skyline , and the place where Jessica might have died .   
It made me uneasy .   
Powers had taken my body from me , they ’d briefly taken my heart , and they ’d almost taken my mind .   
They ’d taken my forcefield and strength and given it over to something else .
Now they ’d taken the sky , and with it , they ’d taken the one person that I ’d known in my life who could make things better without betraying me .
Maybe that was unfair to Crystal and Gilpatrick , to give them the unfair label of people who had helped me but who did n’t help , in that way that I could n’t put words to .
“
Thinking of Jessica ?
” he asked .
“
Yeah .   
I do n’t want to dwell on it too much ,
” I said .   
I put my iced tea down .   
“
I ’m here for therapy .
”
“ The therapy I provide is going to be different because I ’m new to working with capes .   
My background is in cognitive - behavioral therapy , and in the past I worked with police officers , paramedics , firemen , doctors , and other rescue personnel .
”
“
It seems pretty relevant , ” I said .
“ I think so , ” he said .   
“
But powers are complicated and you might have to talk me through some things you take for granted .   
If you can be patient with me , I ’d like to work with you on identifying problems and goals , then addressing your patterns of thought and action to change your emotional landscape , fix the problems , and reach the goals .
”
“ You might have a bit of an uphill battle , doctor .
”
“
Which part ?
” he asked .
“
Thought , action , emotional landscape , problems and goals .   
All of the fucking above .
”
“ Do you want to try explaining it ?
” he asked .   
“
A big part of what we would be doing is setting goals .   
A starting point in figuring out what to address or explaining yourself in totality could be starting off with where you ’re coming from , where you are currently , and where you ’re going .
”
“ I- ” I started .   
It was hard to put things into words .   
“
Currently I ’m bothered .   
Because I feel like ambushing me at the courthouse , having me draw the image instead of writing out my feelings , leaving that image out where I can see it , and having this meeting on the rooftop , it ’s … confrontational .
”
“ Confrontational , ” he said .   
His eyebrows went up briefly .   
“
Can you elaborate ?
”
“
Pushing me , or testing my boundaries , trying to catch me off balance .   
It feels like little plays I ’ve had to deal with for a long time .   
I do n’t know if you ’re doing it intentionally because you want to get past my guard or if it ’s unintentional and you ’re doing it because you ’re insecure .   
Because I have experience dealing with people who do that .
”
“ Okay , ” he said .   
“
Let ’s get back to that in a minute .
”
“
Fine .   
Where am I from ?   
I was raised by capes to be a cape , and after finally getting powers I lived a lifetime in three years .   
I was reborn , I rushed through my education , I made mistakes , I started working , I found someone who I wanted to spend the rest of my life with , I … started losing people .   
I went to the funerals .   
I gave my dad showers , because he needed the care .   
Then it was my turn , except … worse than death .   
I ended up in a hospital and a care center , broken and kind of forgotten or ignored .   
I ca n’t leave that hospital room or that feeling .
”
“ I ’ve heard the general story .   
We   will touch on that .   
I think I can help you if you want that help .   
I ’ve dealt with a lot of people who had rooms or scenes they could n’t put behind them .
” I shrugged .   
“
I do n’t think it ’s that easy .   
It was two years that I was like that .   
Every moment was a scene unto itself .
”
“
Understood .   
Just do me a favor and do n’t dismiss the idea of it being fixable right away .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .
“
That ’s where you ’re coming from , then .   
A lifetime of crisis is hard enough to deal with , and you did n’t have the tools to deal with it .
”
“
I had some , ” I said , annoyed .   
Annoyed because he was n’t jumping to the right conclusion and because he was n’t Jessica .   
There could n’t be a Jessica because Jessica was gone .   
“
I was raised to be a heroine .   
I did n’t do it all right
, I cringe at who I used to be , and how I used to hurt people , but I was given more tools than most people my age , I think .
”
“ Okay , ” he said .
“
Yeah .   
I ’m getting sidetracked .   
Where am I now ?   
I ’m trying to make sure that a whole lot of people , some of Jessica ’s old patients foremost among them , do n’t end up
like I did , because there ’s nothing I ’m willing to do to undo that or unlive those years , but I can at least save other people from it .
”
I stabbed the table a few times with my finger to punctuate the last few words .
“ You feel what you had to deal with with could have been averted , and you want to avert it for others .
”
“ One thousand percent
, ” I said , with emotion .   
“
One thousand fucking percent , it could have been averted .
”
“ By an outsider ?   
Or by someone close to the situation ?
”
“
Both .   
By- by any of us paying more attention or communicating more , or paying more attention to powers and how powers work , or being a little bit more of an actual family .   
It could have been better if I ’d fought better or harder and torn through some mutant dogs and gotten home sooner , if I ’d dodged that one acid spittle or follow - up hit and avoided being taken out of commission , or if one less person had died maybe those of us who were grieving might have been clearer headed
and we could have steered things away .
”
He gave me a sympathetic look .   
When he answered me , I could n’t hear him
that well in the physical feeling of how agitated I was and how uncomfortable I was in my own skin .   
I had n’t nosedived into panic or feeling off , but I ’d walked here and I ’d gotten out of breath walking .   
Now I could n’t get back into breathing regularly .
I was n’t making sense , because he did n’t have the context for all of that .
I did n’t want to make sense .
I wanted to put him off balance , to shake him and get more of a sign than a sorry look and kind , quiet assurance that he could put me on the right track .
I wanted to gut him .   
Not to impale him or tear his stomach out , but to make him feel a fraction of what I felt , emotionally .
“ Breathe , ” he said .
“ I ’ve become pretty- ” I started .   
I stumbled on the word .
“ Breathe .
”
“
Pretty accustomed to the breathing , thank you very much .
”
“ Okay , ” he said .   
“
Good .   
Come back to here .   
This rooftop .   
Cool weather , your drink .   
Have a taste .
”
“
I ’m not not here , ” I said .   
“
Okay ?
”
“
Got it , ” he said .   
“
Do you want to take a minute to catch your breath ?   
What works for you ?
”
“
I don’t- ” I said .   
I stopped .   
“
I ’m fine .
”
“ Do you want to carry on with that thread of conversation , or would you like to change topics ?
”
“ I do n’t see the point in carrying on , I guess , ” I said .   
“ I do n’t want to sound like I ’m resistant to therapy or anything , but I ’m kind of frustrated .
”
“ Okay , ” he said .   
“ You do n’t see the point- are you frustrated because you think this is insurmountable ?   
Or is it because you do n’t feel heard ?
”
“
Both , ” I said .   
“
No .   
Actually , neither . ”
He nodded slowly .   
“
Neither , then .
”
“ I think there are skills I can learn and ways I can deal better .   
I think this is doable .   
But I think the way we ’re going about it is wrong .   
Because you hear a good bit of what I ’m saying , not all , and you do n’t understand .
”
“ Fair , ” he said .   
“
I ca n’t know your experience .   
I do think I can come to understand it .
”
“
That feels like a canned answer , ” I said .   
“ Like the kind of thing someone says when they ca n’t come up with a good response .
”
“ Victoria , ” he said .   
“ I am on your side here .
”
“ I know , ” I said .   
“
Absolutely .
”
“
Okay ?
” he asked .   
“
Yes , maybe the response was a little trite , but I do n’t think it ’s wrong .   
I ca n’t know where you ’re coming from .   
From what you describe , that could be a good thing .   
From what you describe and from what I was told , the experience was legitimately horrifying .   
Sometimes when you ’re in a bad place you need someone who is n’t in that place to lead the way out .
”
I drew in a breath .   
He held up a hand .
“
Canned , I know .   
Bear with me , please .
”
“ Bearing , ” I said .
“ If it reassures you , I have a lot of experience helping people through trauma .   
I ’ve spent twelve years with people , with heroes , who were traumatized on and off the job .   
I ’ve dealt with people who were scarred head to toe , and their experiences after were not too dissimilar to what you most likely experienced in that hospital room .   
Others have been through what you ’ve been through and they found their way through it .   
I have confidence that I can help you do the same .
”
I drew in a deep breath .
“
You are not alone , ” he said .
“ You spent a lot of time with heroes , you say , but you do n’t mean capes when you say hero .   
You ’re new to helping caped heroes , you said .
”
“
Yes , ” he responded .   
“ I get it .   
You came from a background that celebrates capes , that puts a lot of importance on costumed heroics .   
You value that and it matters that I admitted I ’m
not that experienced .
”
“
I celebrated capes ,
yeah ,
but you know my aura is all about awe and fear , right ?   
I put my awe of capes behind me a good while ago , ” I said .   
“
So that background ?   
It ’s not
that I ’m elitist .   
It ’s that I ’m worried .   
I ’m worried you do n’t understand because the normal rules do not apply .   
Every cape you deal with is alone and unique .   
They have their own rules and neuroses .   
They have their unique , personal powers and challenges .
”
“
Everyone ’s unique , Victoria .   
I do n’t think that ’s exclusive to capes .   
We can look to common ground .
”
I shook my head .   
I was getting annoyed again .   
I could n’t put words to what I was trying to encapsulate for him .   
Something I felt Jessica Yamada got .   
The consequences .   
“ Capes magnify , okay ?   
They exaggerate .   
The personalities , the issues , the disorders .   
Everything gets bigger or more distorted .   
It ’s why , if you really truly understood what I ’m trying to convey , you ’d hear what I said back at the courthouse , and you ’d find those kids someone .   
Because Jessica was worried and Jessica got it .   
If you understood , you would n’t be here with me , you ’d be running to get these kids some attention .
”
“
There are n’t resources .   
I ’m sorry .
”
I drew in a breath , then huffed it out , because I could n’t quite get enough oxygen .   
I was too agitated to be still , even to the point of keeping my lungs in a state of equilibrium .
I had n’t responded , so he carried on .   
“ If you were to work with me , we ’d work on outlining goals .   
What I would work on you with would be fundamentals .   
Fundamentals work because they apply whether you ’re a five year old , a police officer , a surgeon , or a person with powers .   
You are human .   
Most of the rules still apply .
”
Hosting this first meeting on a rooftop was a mistake , because I felt the very real impulse to just stand from my chair , put down my iced tea , and fly away .
I felt other impulses too .   
To break the table , to try to drive some point home by scaring him through a display of power .
The Warrior Monk would n’t have approved of that , though .
My voice was small .   
“
I do n’t know if I ’m human .
”
“ I beg your pardon ?   
Is this a case of arguing the idea of ‘ parahuman’ ?
”
“
No , ” I said .   
My voice sounded very automatic , as I found the words .   
“
When my- when the incident happened .   
I was mutated , changed into a tangle of limbs , heads , torsos , pelvises and connecting tissue .   
I could n’t speak and I could n’t eat without assistance .   
I could barely move under my own power .
”
“ That was outlined for me , ” he said .   
“ I ca n’t even imagine .
”
“ I had my emotions twisted around .   
To make me fall in love with the person who did that to me , and to experience unending heartbreak over the fact that she could n’t be with me
and I could n’t be with her .   
My-
she was family , I always saw her as family .   
I did n’t exactly leave that behind or stop seeing her that way , so it felt wrong , twisted , even as I felt it in full .
”
“ You would argue , then , that this is beyond the usual human experience ?
”
“ I do n’t think I ’m
human , doctor , because when Gold Morning happened , she put me back together .   
She fixed the feelings and she stripped away the excess flesh .   
She made me the way I had been on the day I ’d been when I was turned into a monster .   
People came and wrapped blankets around me , and I was numb from shock and trying to remember how to move again when she talked to me .
”
“
She talked to you ?
”
“
She rambled .   
She was never good in a crisis and me being fixed was a crisis , I guess .   
She told me , um-
” I scratched at my arm , then stopped myself .
“
There ’s no rush , ” Doctor Wayne said .
I met his eyes .   
“
She told me that when she made that body , larger than mine , the sprawling , broken , wretched thing , raw materials were harvested from stray cats , dogs , and rodents .   
Birds , bugs , other things .   
People ’s household pets that were left behind after Leviathan attacked .   
She said , um , she said-
”
I felt like I ’d get caught up in a loop of ‘ ums’ if I let myself continue talking .   
I stopped to drink some of the iced tea I ’d barely touched .
“
Um , ” I said , defeating the point of the pause .   
“
Just , you know , I should be careful about giving or getting transplants .   
There ’s a chance it would n’t be compatible with humans .   
Understand ?
”
He did n’t respond .   
Good .
“
Because she did n’t want to get carried away , she wanted to get me as close to normal as she could get me and stop herself there .   
Then she said-
she ’d ask if I wanted more fixes , and I could n’t talk
so I shook my head no .   
She asked if I wanted my memories of things erased and I could n’t let myself have that because there ’s nobody left in the world I trust enough to protect me from her , except me .   
So I told her no , and I told her never to show her face in front of me again .   
So I’m- I’m- ” I blinked away tears .
“ I am very alone , doctor , ” I said .   
“
My maybe - not - one - hundred - percent - human self is going to fight like hell to save people from … from that- ”
I indicated the horizon .   
The portals speared and lurched up into the sky , frozen where they were , the sky on the far side a different shade .
“ -And from other horrors .   
I ’m not going to win every fight .   
I would really appreciate some help to keep me in the fight .   
Because we have a brief moment of calm , and history suggests the periods of calm before the crises get shorter and shorter .
”
Again , there was n’t an immediate response .   
He fixed his gaze on the broken horizon because it meant he did n’t have to make eye contact with me .
I ’d gutted him .   
It was wholly satisfying and far from being a good feeling .   
He ’d felt something , been shaken , he was forced to reassess his perspective , and now maybe there was a chance he ’d understand .
These things were n’t easy .   
They required a little baring of the naked and vulnerable soul .   
Revealing who and what we were .
⊙ “ Freak .   
Monster .
”
“
Enough , thank you .   
Please .
”
The formalities of a courtroom were looking pretty darn sweet , now that things had reached this point .   
Rain ’s accusers were noisy , and the officers in the room were fighting an uphill battle to keep the peace .
They ’d been given a chance to speak and make their arguments , and every one was as angry and vicious as the last .
I felt uncomfortable .   
I was only on the periphery of it .   
I could n’t imagine what Rain felt , being the focus .
“ That should be enough .   
Thank you .   
Your feelings have been made abundantly clear , and I and the other court proctors , I ’m sure , agree that the pain and loss are real , profound , and very much present .
”
There were more noises from that part of the room .
“
May I speak ?
” someone asked .
“ If you have something to add , that has n’t already been stated .
”
“ I do , sir .
”
It was a young girl , twelve or so .   
She had thick , straight dark hair with severe bangs and an ankle - length dress .
“
Hi , Rain , ” she said .   
Her voice was steady , but she held a paper or a letter , and it fluttered in her hands .
“
Hi , ” Rain said , his voice faint .
“
My name is Staci .   
I was at the mall , the day the Fallen attacked it , but I was not inside when the attack happened .   
I really do not hope that people get upset because they think I have no place to speak .   
Two of my friends died that day
and I think because I saw the aftermath and how the school and the families dealt with it , my perspective is valid .
”
Her speaking style was stilted , as she read from the page .
“
Two people died and three families were left devastated .   
Many of their friends were anguished to hear about what happened .   
School has not felt the same .
”
“
I ’m
so sorry
, ” Rain said .
The girl nodded , an intense motion that betrayed nervousness .
“ I can not imagine what it was like to come from where you did .   
I wrote another letter that I planned to read here or give to you
and I changed my mind while I sat here listening .   
I wrote this down over the last hour .   
I do n’t think you should blame yourself .   
You were a teenager and teenagers do n’t always make the best decisions .   
I have a big sister , so I know .
”
It was an attempt at a joke , as she turned to her sister in the seat beside her .   
Nobody really laughed , though , and the silent disapproval of the people sitting around her seemed to drive things home , because her nervousness amplified tenfold .   
Her mom reached over to rub at her arm and shoulder .
“ I do n’t speak for everyone .   
I definitely do n’t .   
But I ’ve hurt and cried a lot over the past year
and I ’m glad you came here
and you did this .   
Thank you .   
I do n’t expect others to
but I forgive you .
”
There were noises of discontent .   
People could n’t shout down a child , but they could make it clear they did n’t agree .
“
Thank you , ” the court proctor said .
“ Everly ?
”
Rain asked .   
“
That was your friend ?   
With the red hair ?
”
“
Yes .   
And Sarah was the other .   
How do you know that ?
”
“ I see and hear them every night , in my dreams , ” he said .   
“
Sarah had the blonde hair then .
”
“
Yes .
”
“ I ’ve memorized the faces , ” Rain said .   
“
I ’m so sorry .
”
“ I do n’t blame you for them dying , ” Staci said .   
“
The people who set the fires were the ones to blame .
”
“ I did n’t save them .
”
“ You were scared .
”
Rain had wet eyes .   
“
I was so stupid .
”
“ You did n’t have a chance to know better .
”
The noises from Rain ’s detractors grew louder .   
Things dissolved from there , with the officers trying to keep order .   
Staci ducked out , her parents providing a bit of a shield .   
They left through the door .
The man with the nice hair announced , “ The court would like to take a brief recess .   
We ’ll give Staci and her family a minute , and then we ’ll leave .   
There are refreshments out in the hall .   
Rain ’s acquaintances can stay , as they wanted to provide their testimony regarding his character in private , without giving up identifying details .
”
The room emptied .   
The court personnel , minus some guards that went to the hall , Rain , Rain ’s lawyer , and our group remained .
“
This is hard , ” the gruff man with the white , messy hair and beard said .   
“
We ’re short on heroes .
”
“ I know , ” Rain said .   
He wiped at his eyes .   
“
I ’m not much of a hero .   
But I ’ll be one in the future , given a chance .
”
“
But you ’ve expressed a desire to go to prison , ” the gruff man said .
“
This kind of thing ca n’t be something where nothing happens , ” Rain said .   
Sveta ’s sentiment .
“
Prison is n’t there solely for your absolution , Rain , ” the frumpy woman said .
“ I know .
”
“ You reported one attempt on your life .   
Do you think you ’ll be safer if you ’re in custody ?
”
“
No , ” Rain said .   
“ Probably the opposite .
”
“ We ’ll do what we can .   
Your friends .   
We will have some questions for the record , but to start us off , do we have any arguments against a stay in the juvenile prison while we wait for the courts to process the young man ?
”
“
Yes , ” Kenzie said .   
Heads turned her way .   
“
No .   
I just think it is n’t right .
”
“
These things rarely are , ” Kimberly , the woman from the Wardens said .   
“
Then to get this out of the way , we note no strong arguments against a stay in our custody .   
The crimes are severe enough to warrant one .   
You have a few months of wait before the courts will even begin to address your case , but it should be quick once you reach that point .   
Time served will count against any sentence .   
There will be no remuneration if no sentence is doled out .
”
“ I understand , ” Rain said .
“
Then when the recess concludes , we ’ll note the verdict and seal the paperwork .   
Until then , if my colleagues do n’t mind , I ’d like to get as much information as possible from you and your group , for the court record and the Wardens . ”
“ I will help however I can , ” Rain said .
“
Then , to go back to the timing of when you provided information about the Mathers , why the time provided ?
”
“ I was sedated for a surgery , swapping my eyes and ears out .   
I started to provide information as soon as I was able .   
Before then , Mama Mathers was in effect .
”
“
Tell us about the timing of your interactions with her .   
We would welcome input from the rest of the group as well .
”
Rain continued , and I added my own comment .
In the moment , though , I was mostly just taking in how Rain seemed to be .   
He sat straighter , and he spoke with more conviction .   
Something in him that had been bound up was free .   
In the face of his sentence and an interrogation from a staff member of the Wardens , Rain looked at ease for the first time I ’d ever seen him .   
He still was n’t one to smile , but I imagined he could come close .








Chris cackled as we jerked to an abrupt stop .
“ Ease up , Chris , ” Tristan said .
“ Ignore him , ” I suggested .
“ Look , ” Tristan said , leaning forward to peer over the steering wheel .   
“
I can admit it when I ’m not good at something .   
It ’s different when you have someone looking over your shoulder and acting as your laugh track .
”
“ You ’re doing fine , ” Kenzie said .
“ Compliments are a supply and demand thing , ” Chris said .   
“ If you give them out for nothing , they are n’t worth anything .
”
“
Thanks , Chris , ” Tristan said , sarcastic .   
Traffic started moving again .   
He started the van moving again , then made another abrupt stop .   
My head smacked back against the headrest .
“
How do you not know how to drive ?
” Chris asked .
“
I know how to drive , Chris .   
I got my license before the raid on the Fallen , in case we needed to drive a bus or something .   
I needed something to do when I was n’t at the hideout .
”
“ I can imagine how that would have gone .   
Not to worry , fellow heroes , I learned how to drive just in case this happened !   
Then you drive us straight into a ditch .
”
“
I can drive straight , Chris , in case you have n’t noticed .
”
“ I did notice , but it was easier to word it that way than to try to describe what you ’re doing now , with the stop , start , stop , start thing .
”
“ Traffic is stop - start .
”
“ Traffic is stop , coast , and start .   
I was thinking you were wearing the boots from your costume , because your foot is so heavy .
”
“
He ’s new , Chris .   
Ease up , ” I said .
“
Okay , ” Chris said , before immediately betraying his word by saying,”Isn’t
it a rule that every self respecting teenager has to be in line to get their license the moment the DMV opens on their sixteenth birthday ?
”
“ The DMV was n’t open the day I turned sixteen , ” Tristan said .   
“
On account of the world having ended the year before .
”
“ Excuses , ” Chris said .
“ I did n’t get my license when I turned sixteen , ” Sveta said .   
“
But I do n’t have hands , feet , or a definitive birthday .
”
“ Excuses , ” Chris said , again .
I offered my own input , “ I can fly , so it was never a priority .   
I can drive , I had my license , but the only practice I really got in the last four or five years was driving the Patrol buses from parking space to parking space so we could shovel the whole lot .   
Tristan is a better driver than I am .
”
“
Why are you guys so lame ?
”
Chris groaned .   
“ Not being able to drive sucks , and I ’ve got to wait three years .
”
The road was fairly busy .   
The timing of our trip meant we were traveling down the main East - West highway that ran through the city , and it seemed like a lot of the farming settlements were transporting stock out to the east , traveling in the direction of the Brockton Bay and Boston areas of the sprawl .   
That procession was compounded by the stream of construction vehicles heading toward the city center .
In the van , we had Tristan in the driver ’s seat , me in the passenger seat , and Kenzie wedged between Sveta and Chris in the back .
Tristan stopped again , but there was more than enough clearance between himself and the car ahead of him , and the stop was premature .   
A car behind us honked , long and loud .
“
Why did you stop just now ?
” Chris asked .
“ I saw movement out of the corner of my eye .
”
“
There was n’t any movement , ” I said .
Tristan crept forward until he could stop at a more reasonable distance behind the car ahead of us .
“
I know that now .   
It was a shadow .   
I ’m in battle mentality , I think .   
I ’ve spent years as a cape
and I ’ve only been behind the wheel for a few hours now ,
I ’m stressed , and my brain is going for what it knows .
”
“
That might make sense , ” I said .   
“
But that does n’t mean you should n’t work on fixing it .
”
“ I know , I know .   
I can get past this , ” he said .   
He was frowning , staring at the road , even though the van was n’t moving .   
“
If I ’m reactive and defensive , I need to make that work with something that ’s either stop or go .
”
“
It ’s a pretty crummy battle mode if you ’re reacting to things that are n’t there , ” Chris said .
“
Hey Kenzie , ” Tristan said .   
“
Do me a favor ?
”
“ Any time .
”
“
Get him .   
Shut him up by any means necessary .
”
Chris was directly behind me , so I could n’t see anything more than the periodic glimpse of a flailing limb I got in the window
’s reflection .
Tristan continued driving , a little more confident now that he was n’t being heckled and cackled at .   
He seemed oblivious to Chris ’s noises and curses of protest .
No , not oblivious .   
He smiled wide without looking back as Chris protested with , “ No tinker tech !
”
Outside the van , the city was in a weird place .   
There were a lot of businesses with signs left dark , and a lot of people out on the sidewalks and stairs .   
People were n’t going to work , or they could n’t .
Something was simmering .
I could understand it .   
The sky had been taken from us .   
There might have been an undercurrent of hope , the idea that if we tried hard enough and waited long enough , we could do things right this time .   
Every last person had lost someone or something they cared about .   
We ’d all had to work hard to get through the first winter and contribute .
There had been an implicit hope , I imagined , that if we made those sacrifices and threw ourselves at the problem , we ’d be rewarded with a city that had learned from the mistakes of the past .   
We ’d experienced a paralysis in terms of leadership and even the name
we gave the city , and the conflicting desires from the various groups who had very different ideas of what that perfection looked like might have played a role .
That hope had been leveled .   
There was n’t a point in the city where one of the portals was n’t visible at the horizon .   
There were several points in the city where the portals loomed overhead , dense areas where the main infrastructure of the city had been positioned close to the portals .
“ Tristan , ” Sveta said .   
“
There ’s something I wanted to bring up , but it ’s awkward to , and I do n’t know if it ’s going to be any easier to fit things in when we get to Ashley
’s .
”
“
Oh geez , you ’ve got to drop this on me today ?
” Tristan groaned .
“
Sorry .
”
“
My friend goes to jail , we ’re anticipating another friend doing the same , and I have to drive through this mess , and now you ’re bracing me for something .
”
“ Sorry .   
It ’s not a huge thing , but I thought you ’d want to know .
”
“
Is it the sort of thing where I ’m wearing my pants backwards and nobody ’s had the courage to tell me , or-
” Kenzie snorted .
“ Help , ” Chris eked out the word .
“
-Yeah ,
yuk yuk , Kenz , ” Tristan said .   
“ Or
is it bad news , Sveta ?
”
“
It ’s bad news , I guess .
”
“
Great .
”
“ I know you have issues with Moonsong .   
The Shepherds lost some members , and she impressed people enough that she ’s getting promoted .
” Tristan did n’t immediately reply .
“
Sorry again .   
I thought you should know before you ran into them , ” Sveta said .
“ A promotion .   
She was n’t my favorite person , but I always respected her talent .   
Reach-
we had a lot of good capes .   
It does n’t surprise me .
”
“ What kind of promotion , do you know ?
”
I asked Sveta .   
I could see her over my shoulder .   
“
To a specific function , like team liaision , or a captain of a sub - team ?
”
“ Second in command of their first team .   
Which Weld said puts her third in command overall , somehow .
”
“
Damn it , ” Tristan muttered .
“
That ’s because the Shepherds folded into the Attendant , bringing their name and logo , ” I said .   
“
The people who worked together stayed together as they merged , making them two teams under one name .   
If something happens to the leader of their A - team , the leader of the B team takes over the leadership of the whole group .
”
“ I know Weld is busy , ” Sveta said .   
“
I barely saw him before
but now I only see him for an hour a day , sometimes .   
Maybe Moonsong will be too busy to pay attention to you .
”
“ I do n’t know , ” Tristan said .   
“
Damn it .   
Thank you for telling me , that really does help .
”
“
Are you sure ?
” Sveta asked .
“
Yeah .   
I ’ve got ta figure out what I ’m doing .   
Now I know to stay a solid distance away from them .
”
“ I hope I ’m
not prying , ” I said .   
“
You never really told me what happened .
”
“ I lost it , ” Tristan said , his eyes fixed on the road even though traffic crawled .   
“
I ’m not trying to deflect blame or anything , but I was dealing with the C - seventy bullcrap , three - point - four GPA , kicking ass as a hero on a kick - ass team , made friends and hung out with those friends .   
I did it while living half a life
… and something gave .
”
“ That happens , ” I said , trying to sound neutral .
“
It happens ,
yeah .   
I got desperate and I stopped thinking straight .   
I did some impulsive stuff , dug myself into a hole , and then kept digging .   
I look back and I do n’t even recognize the person I became .
”
“
We all deal with that to some degree , ” I said .   
“
It comes with powers .
”
“
Yeah .   
Dug myself into a hole and kept digging down , and the power situation did n’t help .   
I ’ve always been good at what I do .   
Sometimes it takes time to learn , but if I have the chance to practice , I ’ll practice like hell , and I ’ll be kicking ass in no time .   
It ’s
why I ’m grinding my teeth over the driving .   
Nobody ’s around to teach me
and I do n’t have a car
I can use to practice .   
I ’m really worried I ’m going to break Kenzie ’s parents van , here .
”
“
It ’s okay , ” Kenzie said .   
“
It ’s not a big deal .   
The van was kind of a present to me , to help move my tinker stuff around .   
I really appreciate you taking us .
”
“
It ’s your family ’s van , ” Tristan said .   
“
You ’re the one that ’s being a big help .
”
“
What about your parents ?   
They ca n’t help with the driving ?
” Kenzie asked .
“
It goes back to what happened with Reach .   
I tried to do it all and when I could n’t do it anymore
I let something slip , I became a villain and did n’t even realize it .   
I got arrested , I lost most of my friends from back then , my team , my academic record , and I lost my family .   
My dad does n’t want to do dad things with me .   
My mom is really careful around me , like it ’s all forced .   
They do n’t call me , it ’s always me calling them .
”
“ You go to church with them , ” Sveta said .
“
It ’s bittersweet , ” Tristan said .   
“
They ’re almost normal when we ’re at the church , but I think it ’s because they think I need redemption .
”
“
Rain and Ashley are looking for their redemption by turning themselves in , ” I said .   
“
Would you do the same thing , or am I missing something ?
”
“ Rain is , ” Tristan said .   
“
You ’re right on that one .   
Ashley ?
”
He made a creaky sound , moving his hand .
“
Not redemption ?
” I asked .
“
I do n’t think that ’s so on the nose for her .   
I could be …
”
Traffic was moving , and Tristan was going a decent speed , and this time , as something moved across the road , it was real , and not a phantom shadow .   
Tristan hit the brakes , and I could immediately tell it was n’t going to be enough .
I flew , rising up in my seat , and activated my defenses for a moment , pushing back against my seat .   
I could hear the metal where it attached to the rest of the car protesting , and the entire van lurched .   
A sharp sound to my right marked the Wretch whacking at the door .
We stopped with a few inches to spare .   
A group of people were running across the road .   
Many had masks on , of the mundane sort .
“
Thanks , Vic , ” Tristan said .   
“ Good move .
”
I checked the coast was clear , opened my car door , and flew out , closing it below me before giving chase .
With a higher vantage point , I could see the line of traffic , stretching out down the road , avoiding the area where a portal ’s expansion cut through the highway , forcing a detour onto smaller streets .
I could see the stores and the people clustered around broken windows .
Cause and effect .   
People could n’t get around , which meant they could n’t get to work easily and they could n’t go to stores to make their purchases .   
Power , water , and the delivery of other resources had been interrupted in places .   
Stores , restaurants , and services closed or reduced their hours , because they lacked employees , customers , and resources .   
More people were dicking around with no or temporarily interrupted employment , frustrated at the backslide in progress and the overall hopelessness of things …
People wanted what they were owed , maybe .   
Or they wanted to feel like they were making some headway in things , when it felt so hard to obtain .   
They saw the unmanned stores and they noted the lack of proper law enforcement .
Looters .   
These were n’t the first I ’d seen , and they were n’t the only symptom of the city ’s current ails .
Will these unpowered people look back and think that they ca n’t recognize who they were ?   
Or is it easier to justify and massage past events and past wrongs committed , if you do n’t have powers to punctuate , exaggerate , and highlight it ?
I did n’t have my costume , and I still had my jacket threaded through the triangle of upper arm , forearm , and sling strap , so it rested across my forearm .
Their getaway vehicle was on the other side of the highway , and there was less traffic going toward the city center .   
They ’d drive off and disappear into the side roads somewhere .   
The ones at the front of the pack were loading up the trucks with bags of stuff , on the road just beyond the highway .   
The middle of the pack was already over the concrete barrier that separated the westbound traffic from the eastbound , and the stragglers were just behind them , hesitating because traffic was incoming .
I intercepted the people who were climbing into the first of the trucks .   
I used my aura to spook the first guy and to try to get his grip to ease up where he was holding onto the door and the side - grip at the chair back .   
He twisted around , hands up to defend himself , and I simply tugged him back , letting him fall to the ground .   
No strength needed .
I used my toe to nudge the keys from his grip to the ground , and he did n’t fight me .   
Then I stomped on them , forcefield up , with enough force to drive the metal into the concrete .
I pointed at him , and I ordered him , “ Stay . ”
He nodded .
I believed him .   
Marching toward the other truck , where people were rushing to load electronics into the back , I spotted orange lights at the base of the truck .
No need to bother , then .   
I ignored them , walking casually , and the fact I ignored them seemed to throw them off .
I chose the largest group that had assembled off to the side .   
Six individuals , all together .   
I let my aura burn
and I watched the effect it had on them .   
My eyes searched for weapons and saw none .
This was n’t a planned thing , a raid or a rush .
It was impulse .   
I could even imagine it was desperation , like how people stole for a loaf of bread .   
The difference was that this was n’t to fulfill such a basic need .
Probably , anyhow .   
The cold season was sneaking up on us , and they might have felt they were n’t ready .   
Maybe this was borne of that .
Except I felt they ’d probably be more organized if they were thinking that far ahead .   
There were bags of what looked like clothes , and they were n’t winter clothes .   
Not needs in the sense that those clothes would help survive the winter .
“ Bad luck , guys , ” I said .   
“
You pulled this just as my friends and I happened to pass by .   
Let ’s make this easy .   
Surrender .
”
A woman hucked a brick - sized package of batteries at my head .   
My forcefield caught it , knocking it aside .   
Heads turned to look at her .
I could remember the movie scenes where the mob of criminals went after the cape or hero , shot , saw they were invincible , and then kept shooting despite the futility of it .   
I was suspicious
the PRT had used leverage over the media to encourage those scenes , with the follow - up of the mob getting taken to pieces .   
A way of affecting the public ’s approach to capes and the willingness to go all - out .
“
Oh .   
I am really , really sorry , ” she said .
There it was .
“ Get down on the ground , ” I said .   
“
Hands on your heads .
”
Some started to obey ,
the woman foremost among them .   
A group of others at the periphery and around the first truck dropped their stuff and bolted .   
They all ran as a group at first , and then , as I took off and one saw me on the approach , the idea went out .   
They scattered .
The car door behind me slammed .   
The driver had climbed into the second truck , and others were piling into the back with the stolen merchandise .   
The truck peeled out , making it about half a foot before the spike of stone that Tristan had made popped the tires .
“
Stay , ”
I told the ones who were already on the ground or partway there .   
“
The way things are now , if you cooperate and own up , you ’ll get off with a slap on the wrist .   
Okay ?
”
I saw a few nods .
I went after the ones who were running .   
I started at the far left .
No forcefield , no super strength .   
I flew to catch up and I caught the first one mid - run .   
Because I could maneuver in the air at the same time I caught up , it was relatively trivial to get in a position to stick my leg between his knees and trip him .
I left him behind , relatively sure I could catch a second one before he picked himself up and got far enough away .
The second went roughly the same way .
The third one I caught up to had a knife that was made for the kitchen , not for fighting .   
She disarmed herself swiping at my forcefield , and promptly surrendered .
By the time I checked on the first and caught him limping away , Sveta had rounded up the others , including the second and third I ’d stopped .
She was fast , she had reach , and she was mobile .   
This was very much her thing .   
She had n’t left any marks more serious than a palm with road rash .
We herded the ones who had bolted in the direction of the disabled getaway vehicles .   
The ones I ’d told to stay had stayed .   
The van had pulled off the highway , and Looksee was standing on the top , watching over things .   
She ’d have projected her costume .   
Capricorn had his costume on with no armor but the helmet , and was standing guard by the store with the broken windows .
I flew closer to them to get a status update , and as I passed the van , I could see Chris still in the backseat , gagged and ensnared by Looksee ’s
eyehook , the prehensile tendril with the camera and claw at the end .
“ Lucky that we happened to be passing by , ” Looksee said .
I smiled .
I did n’t have the heart to tell her .   
This kind of low - level dissent was happening all over the megalopolis .   
I could see it whenever I flew over .   
When I ’d told Ashley that we intended to arrive at two thirty , I ’d plotted for a detour like this , because it was next to inevitable .
It would get worse ; the shock was wearing off .
⊙ An armed Patrol soldier greeted us at the door .   
His was a face I ’d seen from the Stratford patrol , not far from Bridgeport .
“ We sent our information ahead , ” I said .
“ You did .   
You ’re the girl from the community center thing , right ?
”
“
Yeah , ” I confirmed .
“
Okay .
”
It was n’t a smiling , accepting okay .   
“
She ’s inside .   
Be good .
”
Sveta raised her eyebrows at me the moment we were past the guard and inside the apartment .   
Some things were already set aside , lining one side of the hallway , making the fit through fairly tight .   
Sveta had once described the apartment as being an unusual mix .   
I could see it in place now- cardboard boxes and plastic totes in places , and then furniture in other places that definitely had n’t come from a box store .
The table by the kitchen door was wrought iron with curled - up feet , meeting and melding at knee height and then separating out to grip the edges of dark - tinted glass top .   
There were some bills on top , unopened .   
A mirror with a wrought - iron frame loomed ominously above the table .
I really hoped the mirror was fastened securely , because it had to weigh fifty pounds with all the iron curls and thorns , and the tinted glass below it would not survive an impact .
The kitchen had a similar theme , but the appliances were red , and the clear glass electric kettle , table , and stool were glass with a red tint .   
There was n’t much wall space , and narrow scroll - like strips of cloth ran down the available spaces between cabinets .   
Calligraphy - like strokes of red paint suggested a male ’s head , broad shoulders and buttocks , and the woman standing in profile .   
A flick of the brush suggested the nipple for the woman and a knot - like flourish indicated
that which was visible between his legs .   
The electric kettle was on , burbling .
The dining room was the most conventional of the rooms , with dark , stately furniture , a rug , and an ornate gold - painted picture frame behind the head of the table .   
A massive brown horse with the whites of its eyes showing had its teeth around a man ’s head , while its hoof held the man ’s body down .   
It was partway through tearing the man
’s head off , ribbons of gory flesh still connecting the head and neck , and the man
’s fingers were slipping from the horse ’s reins .
It was such an odd thing to see that I paused mid - stride to confirm it was n’t my mind playing tricks on me .   
Had she found it or commissioned it ?   
If it was the former , who painted that kind of work and put it out into the world ?   
If it was the latter , why that , specifically ?
I glanced at the candlesticks without candles , and an empty picture frame on the wall behind the length of the dining table , just as ornate as the horse one .   
There were boxes in the corner , too .
The apartment was narrow , and it looked like sets of stairs allowed what I assumed were the bathroom and bedroom to be right above the living room .
The living room had a reclining couch and a series of chairs , none of which matched but all of which seemed to follow a theme .   
There were bookcases along the wall , all of the same make , with a unique design element that really came into its own with the bookcase closest to the window .   
Starting with the middle of the five bookshelves , getting progressively more intense , the wood had been burned , and clear resin had been molded in a shape to emulate the unburned bookshelves .   
Flakes of something red and metallic had been set in the burned parts of the wood , so they caught the light from the window and made it look like the wood was still hot from recent fire .
Ashley was perched in a narrow chair with long legs and a high seat , hands clasped together .   
Jester was there too , reclining on the couch .   
A large black and white picture of a lithe , bare - chested or naked man was on the wall above Jester , the head and lower body out of frame , his arms twisted up behind his back in a tortured position with ribbons loosely binding them .
“
Hi Ashley , ” I said .   
Others offered their greetings .   
“ Hi Jester .
” Jester smiled .
“ Why ’d you come ?
”
“ The others either did n’t want to or did n’t care , and I wanted to .   
I still probably owe you something from when you carried the slack back at work .
”
“ Nothing ’s owed , ” I said .
He just shrugged in response .
“
This place really came along since my last visit , ” Sveta said .
“ I would hope so , ” Ashley said .   
“
It ’s been a little while .
”
“
It ’s a shame to pack it up , ” Kenzie said .   
She hopped into a chair .
“
Yes , ” Ashley said .   
“
Yes it is .
”
“ I love the bookshelves , especially the one at the end , ” I said .
Ashley smiled .   
“
I do too .
”
“
There were three the last time I came , ” Sveta said .   
“ The one at the end had to have taken the longest to put together .
”
“
It did , ” Ashley said .   
“
It came out well .   
I ’m pleased .
”
“ I ’d be worried about the resin refracting light at the wrong angle and starting a fire , ” Chris said .
“
You are just dead set on being a stick in the mud today , are n’t you ?
” Tristan asked .
“
It ’s fine , ” Ashley said .   
“
I was warned about that , and I was careful .
”
“ If we ’re admiring decor , I like this ribbon dancer dude , ” Tristan said , indicating the picture above the couch .
Chris snorted .
“ I wish I had the artistic sense to figure out what it ’s saying , ” Tristan added .
“ If you have theories , keep them to yourself , ” Ashley said .   
“
I ’d hate to have it ruined .
”
“ Lips sealed , ” Sveta said .
“ We got in a fight on the way here , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I barely got to do anything , there were looters , and they raided a store , so I got most of their pictures before they could run , so I could track them down later if I had to .   
Then I did a sweep of the crowd to see if any looters were trying to hide among the bystanders , but I did n’t find anything .
”
“
That ’s too bad .   
It would have been a nice little victory .
”
“ I wish I knew if it did n’t find anything because there was n’t anything or if it was because it did n’t work .
”
“ You ’ll figure it out .   
You ’re clever , ” Ashley said .
“
How are you doing , Ashley ?
” Sveta asked .   
“ Is there anything we can do ?
”
“ I ’ve committed a cardinal sin , ” Ashley said .   
“
I asked you to help me move , and I do n’t have things packed .   
I put most of my books away , and some of my clothes , but … ”
She moved her hand in her lap .   
Her fingers moved slowly , and they seemed to hit a limit where they would n’t go completely straight .
“
Have you had that looked at ?
” I asked .
“ Rain did .   
He did what he could to fix things , but my usual tinker is gone .   
If these hands fail , then I wo n’t have hands unless they allow me to meet with Rain again , ” Ashley said .   
“ I have n’t been able to pack , as I said , and I ’m being a poor hostess , because I have food but ca n’t serve it .
”
“
I can grab it , ” Jester said .
“ The water for tea should be boiled .   
Pour it in the pot and bring it straight down .   
There ’s a shutter by the stove .   
Inside you ’ll find nuts , chocolate and cookies .   
The serving tray and sugar bowl are above the shutter .   
There are cold drinks in the door of the fridge for those who do n’t want tea , and a little pitcher of milk .
”
“
That sounds like a lot , ” Tristan said .   
“ I ’ll come with .
”
“ I normally allow myself one treat a day , with the same for any guests-
I do n’t have many , ” Ashley said .   
“
But we should treat ourselves .
”
“
Are you okay ?
”
Sveta asked , again .   
“
In the heat of everything last week , I said some harsh things .   
I feel guilty now that we ’re here .
”
“ If I ’d refused or if I had tried to get away with it , you would have resented me for it .   
Most of you would have .   
You were right , ” Ashley said .   
“ Do n’t feel guilty .
”
“ If you changed your mind , I ’d have your back , ” Kenzie said .
Chris swatted her over the head .   
“
No .   
Bad .
”
Kenzie stuck her elbow out toward his middle , digging it into softer flesh .   
He grunted .
“
What would be the point , Kenzie ?
” Ashley asked .   
She brought her hand up to her hair to tuck it behind her ear .   
It looked harder than it should have been , with her fingers not cooperating .   
“
What would motivate me to stay ?   
I like some of you , I would n’t be able to stay with you .   
I like my place , I ’d have to leave it behind and run .
”
“ If the tables were turned , and I had to choose between going to jail or staying , getting in trouble , and spending ten percent of the time I do with you guys , I ’d stay , ” Kenzie said .
“ I know , ” Ashley said .   
“
That ’s who you are .
”
“ I think there ’s a better chance that you guys can stay in some form of communication if she sticks to the rules , than if she runs and periodically makes contact , ” I told Kenzie .   
“
We can ask them to make sure something ’s allowed .
”
Kenzie smiled a little .
“ I will make it up to you someday , ” Ashley said .   
“
I promise that .
”
“
Okay , ” Kenzie said .   
She offered more of a smile .
Ashley dropped her eyes to her hands , flexing her fingers .
“
You ’re going to miss out on a lot , ” Chris said .   
“ Shit is slowly and steadily going down , and after this stuff with the portal , it ’s pretty clear the major players are starting to act .   
We still do n’t know who did it .
”
“
The Birdcage was emptied for Gold Morning , ” Ashley said .   
“ If something serious happens , I hope they ’ll release us .   
I could join you then , even prove myself .
”
“
You might not go to prison , you know , ” Kenzie said .
I felt so sorry for that kid .   
She did n’t deserve this .
“ They gave me a short leash , given my history and the people
I ’m connected to , and they told me what to expect , ” Ashley said .
Jasper and Tristan appeared , each carrying a tray .   
The chocolate looked like shards of dark chocolate with chunks of salt embedded in it .   
The cookies were wafers partially dipped in more dark chocolate .
“
We ’re going to end up eating and not doing any packing , ” Tristan remarked .
“ You do n’t need to worry about the furniture .   
If the girls could look after my clothes , and if you could put away my books and pictures , that would be enough for today .   
I ’ll help where I can .
”
“
You ’re sure ?
” Tristan asked .
“ Ashley said the van would be enough , ” Kenzie said .
“ I did .
”
The tea was doled out to those who were drinking tea .   
Others poured their drinks .   
There were n’t enough chairs for everyone present , so I sat on the ground around the crates that were gathered together to act as an impromptu coffee table .
“ Ashley , ” Tristan said .   
“
I talked to Rain about this , it might be worth talking to you .   
Do you have a plan of action if anyone comes after you ?
”
“ You were thinking Love Lost might go for Rain where he is , ” Ashley said .   
“ And
the past allies of Beast of Burden might come for me .
”
“
It ’s not out of the question .
”
“ I wo n’t be alone , ” Ashley said .   
“
I have friends waiting for me .
”
“
Still .
”
“ Still , ” she replied .
“
Okay .
” As people finished their drinks or got restless , they stepped away to start investigating what needed to be put away .   
I licked chocolate from my fingers and cleaned them off with a damp napkin .
Ashley stood , stretching as she walked to the window .   
The unnamed Patrol member who stood at the top of the stairwell cleared his throat loudly .
“
I ’m not doing anything , ” Ashley said .
“
Away from the window , ” he said .   
“
You ’re on paper as a low - rated mover .
”
“ Harry , ” Jester said .   
“
I think we ’re okay .
”
“
Away from the window , ” Harry said .
I tensed , seeing Ashley bristle , standing a little taller , her pupils disappearing .
I thought about intervening , and I had no idea how I was supposed to go about it .   
Maybe getting Harry to safety .
Ashley stepped away from the window .   
“
I ’m going to have to get used to this , I think .   
It ’s going to be hard .
”
“
You promised me there ’d be a someday we ’d meet again , ” Kenzie said .   
“
And you ’ve already broken one promise .
”
“ I know , ” Ashley said .
I ’d been told to do the clothes , but it felt weird to go through Ashley ’s bedroom and things without her there , so I started on the bookshelf .
The team was n’t technically a team anymore , but we could n’t break away clean .
The moment Ashley was on her own retreating to the stairs to look down at the rest of us , it was Chris who went straight to her .   
The two of them walked into the dining room .   
Ashley rubbed at her arm as the two of them talked , and the patrol officer stood a ways back , watching them closely .
That was interesting .   
Were there commonalities , in the physical breakdown ?
I noticed Kenzie was off on her own , fidgeting , and made a concerted effort to rope her into helping me .   
I made it something of a game , filling the box as quickly as I could with one hand while being kind to the books , with Kenzie holding the box , and then taking turns , as she pulled books off the lower shelves .
“ Victoria , ” Ashley said .   
“
Can we talk ?
”
The moment Ashley had been free , Chris had gone to her .   
The moment she was free , she chose me ?
I was caught off guard , but I nodded .
She led me up to her bedroom .   
There were pictures by the wall that had n’t yet been hung up , judging by the lack of marks on the walls .   
The bed was a four - poster with black silk cloth .
“
Who are you keeping an eye on ?
” she asked .
“ Everyone , ” I said .   
“
I ’m making plans to check on members of the team .
”
“
Do n’t neglect Sveta , ” Ashley said .   
“
Her teams are her families .   
She ’s not so different from Kenzie .   
The only people who stick by her are the same kinds of people who get caught up in helping other people .   
It ’s a very lonely thing when you ’re not anybody
’s first priority .
”
“
There ’s Weld , ” I said .
“ Make sure he remembers , then .
”
“
These feel like the final instructions of someone who expects to die soon , ” I said .   
“
Do I need to worry ?   
Do we need to worry ?
”
“ If Death comes for me I ’ll shred him with my power , ” Ashley said .   
“
I beat him once , and I hardly expect to kneel before him now .
”
“
You ’re sure ?
” She shrugged .   
“
Death does n’t worry me .   
Destruction does .
”
“ Destruction of ?
”
“ Of me , ” she said .
I glanced around the room , then indicated the wardrobe .   
She nodded .
I began packing up the clothes as best as I could , when I could n’t fold very effectively .   
She did n’t seem to mind .
“ Destruction of you ?   
How is that different from death ?
”
“ Before you all came , I nearly destroyed those bookcases , and the artwork .   
I almost destroyed that man , Harry , from the patrol .   
I could have shredded him , and it would have been easy .
”
She said it so casually .
“
The girl from the train , Presley , she looks up to you in a way , I think .   
She thinks you ’re awesome .
”
“ I am awe inspiring in my own right .   
It ’s not a surprise , Victoria .   
I do n’t need a gimmick to do it .
”
“
Hey , ” I said .
She smiled .
“
Alright , but- does that not give you a reason to hold back from those impulses ?   
For this girl who really wants to know how to get her hair as white as you have yours , because she wants to emulate you ?   
For Kenzie ?
”
“
It ’s hard to explain .   
Today , I knew you were all coming , and your friend Jester was there , talking to me about nothing .   
I do n’t know what the reasons for holding myself back will be next time , or if I ’ll look for reasons and find nothing there .
” I nodded .   
I focused on folding a dress .
She went on , “ I ’ve been told a sentence is inevitable .   
I ’ll be confined , and people will bark orders at me and expect me to comply .   
I ’ll be destroyed or I ’ll come through it with a better idea of what I need to do to manage it .
”
“ You made a promise to Kenzie , ” I said .   
“
You ca n’t betray that .   
Do n’t give yourself any other choice except to manage it .
”
“ You look after her in the meantime , then ?
” she asked .
I nodded .
“
Then that leaves only three more things , ” she said .
“
Three things ?
”
“ The clothes .   
Pack them , please , but keep anything you like .
”
The clothes were black , black , and more black .   
More to the point , she was a different build than I was , almost narrow , while I considered myself more of an athletic slim .   
There might be issues with fit .
“
Thank you , ” I said .
“
The other two things , hm .   
I could offer it as a trade .
”
“
A trade of what ?
”
“
I ’m
stealing Rain ’s thunder , maybe , but … a haircut ?
”
“
I ’m working with one hand .   
I can use the other some , but … how much of a haircut ?
”
“
The haircut we thought would work for Swansong , ” Ashley said .
I paused .   
“
I think I could manage something .
”
“
In exchange … take my keys .   
Take over the rent for the apartment .
”
My eyebrows went up .
“
You ’re staying with your cousin , you said .   
If you have n’t found a place , then stay here instead .   
Keep the things you like and store the things you do n’t .
”
“
You planned this .
”
“
I never had a place , Victoria .   
My life is vague dreams and clear destruction .   
Again and again , life tells me I ca n’t do this
, I ca n’t do that .   
It goes wrong or I ca n’t think of it as being right
…
and I ’m not talking about right as good .   
The thoughts loop through my head , that nobody can be trusted , everyone is out to get me , and
… dying is a really good reality check .   
I ’m trying to take that to heart .   
I was trying .
”
“
What happened ?   
There were so many moments that seemed so cool , the photo on the train , Swansong , seeing how you were in the sparring …
”
“
All punctuated by fits of pique , madness .   
It ’s not something that goes away or gets better .
”
Those words were uncomfortable .   
There were already some parallels .   
The idea that there could never be a fix to this side of me that I could n’t control …
She continued , “ Some things are starting to make sense , about the group members , my memories , and how this all works , and I ca n’t even figure those things out because getting to tomorrow is already so hard .   
It ’s been hard for too many days .
”
“ It does n’t get easier when you ’re in prison .   
I ’m not saying you should n’t go , but
…
”
“ When I make a mistake now , I kill Beast of Burden .   
If they incarcerate me ?   
I can let myself be someone else
’s concern .   
I think I know what it ’s going to be like , and I ’m ready for it .
” I nodded .   
I struggled to voice a response , because I was pretty sure she was wrong .
She was trying to build a new self like someone built a house of cards .   
It was a precarious thing , and if she slipped up once- destruction of the self .   
Something completely different from death .   
If she had a last chance then this would be it .
She tried to sound confident in tone , and she was n’t convincing me .








Powers had a way of impacting the individual in general terms , beyond the way the Wretch affected me or Kenzie ’s situation affected her .   
In the classes I ’d taken and watched about parahumans , it had been painted out in broad strokes , partially but not wholly based on the PRT classifications .   
The generalized thinker mindset .   
Masters and sociology .   
Changers and identity .
When one could fly , it was easy to feel disconnected .   
Movers in general had issues when it came to feeling or being rooted in things .   
Being someone who had to run , walk , drive , and navigate the city on a day to day basis meant being in the city .   
It meant being on the roads and cooperating with others , watching out for them , and paying attention .
To fly was to be like the celebrity that was chauffeured everywhere .   
It meant not getting that daily dose of social give - and - take , good and bad .    
When I ’d caught a ride to Ashley ’s just a day ago , I ’d suggested flying while everyone else rode .   
I ’d told myself I could do stuff to help out while waiting for them , like we ’d done with our detour .   
In the end , though , Kenzie was probably the only person in the world who would have been so happy to sit wedged in between Sveta ’s hard prosthetic body and Chris , and I ’d sided with the option that helped me stay connected and in tune with the group .
Now I felt the disconnect as profoundly as I had since flying over a flooded Brockton Bay .   
I navigated the air above a gridlock , a sea of red brake lights on a gloomy morning muting the color of much of the city .
I could n’t stop for every incident I saw .   
More disconnection , that I had to see wrongs in progress and ignore them , because there were other priorities , or because I needed to look after myself and things immediate to me .
Once upon a time , in a land a universe away , I ’d told Amy that she could n’t be Scion .   
I ’d had to tell myself much the same , in those hectic days after dad ’s head injury and the devastation of my hometown .
Traffic being outright stopped for ten minutes of me flying was a bad sign .   
Normally I would take my time , zig - zagging , looking for fire and even mundane situations where I could touch down and ask a question or two before taking off again .   
With this and the unrest it was causing , I wanted to get to whatever the source was .
People had headlights on in the fog , and it made for a stark image , with a crowd of people that had abandoned running vehicles now collecting in a mass .   
Some cars were pulling away , driving across fields to circumvent the situation , but they were mired , stopping because-
I had to fly closer to get a look .
A group of people were blocking the road .   
Students .   
It reminded me of the situation we ’d expected with the construction workers planning the demonstration , but this … it was a little more insane .   
The students were blocking the highway and interrupting movement across the city , and people were pissed .   
Capes were already on scene , guarding the narrow no - man ’s land between the groups .
The shouting between the two groups drowned even the howling of car horns as I got closer to the scene .   
I chose one place where the divide was especially narrow to set down .   
No cape - erected barriers here to keep the peace , no Master pets , no effects .   
The mob was held at bay by people in costume who could n’t or would n’t use their power on civilians , and by police who were stretched too thin .   
Stretched thinner , I could see , because they were trying to get the student protesters to break up .   
Too few , and the students too stubborn .
Some cars had left the road and were trying to drive around , but students were putting themselves in front of the vehicles .   
Some of those vehicles inched forward , students sitting or sprawling on the hoods , and others had been stopped from running through the crowd by capes .
Capes , combative already , flinched as I descended , even though I ’d cut my speed to a crawl .   
They relaxed slightly as I raised my good hand .
It was a dangerous position , because the gap between the students and the mob was only a matter of ten or so feet .   
The Wretch could extend out far enough that I was liable to clip one side or the other .   
I could n’t keep my forcefield up , and I was wearing nice clothes .
It was hard to breathe here , between the thin line of students
-roughly three deep , locked elbow to elbow- and the mob of over a hundred people that I could n’t see around or past .   
I could n’t see everything of importance at the same time , and I could n’t hear because protester and irate bystanders shouted at each other with neither group showing any inclination to listen .
In a lot of places , here in particular , it was only costume and uniform that kept people at bay .   
Fear , and the threat of the unknown- just about every cape present serving as that unknown , with powers or capabilities the crowd could n’t know .   
Some of the ex - drivers were close enough for me to touch with my fingertips , had I extended my arm fully .   
I stood with my body twisted , injured arm turned away from them , my arm half - raised , and they backed off some , men and women studying me and figuring out if they could get past me to get what they wanted .
Fog meant humidity and humidity meant I could smell the chemicals of shampoos , mouthwashes and soaps , the sweat and the breath of people pressed in close to one another .   
There was a faint warmth , even , as if they were so heated that it had become manifest .
Through it all was the noise of them .   
I was pretty sure a megaphone was blaring
but I could n’t make out words in the chaos .
Someone pushed in close to the cape nearest me , a guy with a costume I did n’t recognize .   
That gave others the courage to join in .   
Every cape had been ready to act , and powers flared out .   
Some people stopped , and some pressed on .
I was young , I was wearing nice clothes rather than a costume , and I had my arm in a sling .   
People weighed their options and they pressed on , pushing in close , one grabbing my good arm .   
Someone else reached past me , arm brushing past my chest so they could grab the strap of my sling , which was a dickish , dickish move .
I did n’t flinch , using flight to stay upright .   
I made eye contact with the guy , someone with glasses , a mustache , and a khaki jacket , and saw the moment of hesitation .
I set off my aura , and drove that moment home .
Both he and the other guy let go , backing off , and others reacted as well .   
It got the attention of people who were trying to squeeze past a cape who had his cape draping down from wrists to ground , transformed into a fence - like barrier , and past a self - duplicator with a luminescent filament webbing connecting each copy of themselves that they ’d made .   
It bought a moment and a moment mattered .   
People continued to struggle and deal , but nobody tried to grab me or press past me again .
A cape sent their minion trotting between capes and the road ragers .   
People backed off , seeing it coming , and in its wake , the five to ten feet of gap remained .
The crowd was cowed by the failure to push through , and with that came a lowering of volume , just enough that the megaphone could be heard .   
A new voice .   
“ The situation is resolving .   
Return to your cars or they will be rolled off the roads !
”
Some people left right away .   
Others lingered .   
They wanted to stay for the same reason the students were here , I imagined .   
It was for the same reasons the construction union had wanted to act .
“
You okay ?
”
someone asked me .   
He was tall , broad shouldered and narrow waisted , with white armor that seemed to exaggerate the facts , his shoulders flaring out into sweeping points .   
His helmet had the same sweep worked into the top , a man ’s face worked into the front , hyper - realistic but for the lack of eyebrows and lashes , the eyes closed .   
The costume served to exaggerate proportions and joints in a way that made him look like he was put together wrong .
Nice quality , though .   
Ornate , with an artistry that suggested a craftsman had helped to put it together .
“
I ’m fine ,
” I said .   
I brushed at my outfit .   
“ Thank you .
”
“
Emotion powers are volatile , ” the cape said .
“
I ’m well aware ,
” I said .
“ You have to be careful with them in situations like that .   
Even if the effect is something you think you understand , it is n’t always simple .   
Two people can have different reactions to the exact same feeling .
”
“
Yes .   
I do know that .   
I assessed the moment .
”
“
She ’s aware , Ambrosius , ”
I heard a woman say .
Ah .
I turned to look at my mother .   
She ’d been no more than fifty feet away from me
and I had n’t even seen her .   
She was wearing her costume , modified since I ’d last seen it .   
There was some shoulder decoration , decoration around the gloves , and the emblem at her chest , brass tracery decorating and elaborating on the seams and the divisions between colors .   
Light from car headlights flickered as it found gaps in the retreating crowd to dart through , illuminating diagonal lines and ‘ x’ marks that broke up the plain white of the costume .
“
She ’s been a cape for three times as long as you , ” Brandish said .   
“
She ’s a good cape .
”
“ Three times ?
” he asked .
“
Well , not really , ” she said .   
She smiled .   
“
It ’s something I tell myself , that she was a born heroine .   
The powers and the costume came later .
”
“
That ’s your daughter , Brandish ?
” the filament duplicator asked .
“ One of them , ” she replied .
The duplicator turned to the big guy in armor .   
“ Ambro , her group helped save some of the stations from the portal fuckery .
”
The big guy in armor turned his molded face with the closed eyes my way .   
There was a pause , and then he said , “ Thanks .
”
“
Yeah .   
I wish we could have done more , ” I said .
“
I know that feeling , ” he said .   
He turned to Brandish .   
“
I ’m going to go .   
Watch things ?
”
“
Yeah .   
Of course , ” she replied , smiling like there was a joke in there .
Maybe the decade or two of seniority .
“ You look nice , ” Brandish said .   
“ Not in costume ?
”
“ I ’ve got somewhere to be , ” I said .
“
Your friend ’s appointment at the court ?
” she asked .   
When I raised my eyebrows , she said , “ I do pay attention , Victoria .
”
“ I ’m running late , ” I said .   
“
She needs backup , and if this traffic thing keeps anyone , she might not have many people on her side .
”
“
Do n’t run , ” she said .   
She reached out to touch my arm .   
“
Talk for a minute .   
We can talk about little things that do n’t matter , if you want .   
I miss my daughter .
” I sighed .   
I took in the scene .   
A field of weeds had been turned into mud and uprooted plants by the passage of a few hundred road ragers .   
Behind us , students were resisting the ones who were telling them that it was time to pack up , that they ’d gotten their message across and there was no reason to stay .
“
You ’re in costume , ” I noted .   
“ An updated costume .
”
“ I dabble , ” she said .   
“
A little while after I started working , I saw an article about the refugees and how children were getting lost in transition .   
It struck a chord with me .   
Because of what happened to your aunt Sarah and me , and because I ’d lost my own children , in a way , in transition .
”
I shifted my stance , giving her a warning look .
“
I ’ll be good , do n’t fret .   
I have n’t joined a team , but I have connections .   
I get out and do what I can when I ’m not working , and right now I ’m
only working half - days , four days a week .
”
“
What happened to the missing refugee kids ?
”
“
That ’s not the kind of cape work I excel at , I ’m afraid .   
I relieve some capes and watch their neighborhoods so they can investigate it more .   
They give me updates , and I try to keep track and collect information .
”
“
Which is what you ’re good at .
” She smiled .   
She touched my sling .   
“ You got hurt .
”
“ Power nullifier in the mix .
”
“
Of course , ” she replied , in conjunction with the same smile she ’d given Ambrosius earlier .
She seemed so much more like herself here , in costume .
“ You did good work , Victoria , doing what you did at Fenway Station , and tipping people off about the other stations .   
We ’ve been so stunned in the wake of it all that I think we ’re all still processing it .   
Still , as people come to grips with it , I ’ve tried to let them know about the role you and your team played in controlling the damage .
”
“
Thank you , ”
I said , quiet .   
“
You made it out
okay ?
”
“ Some of my coworkers were working late .   
It ’s part of the reason for me working half - days .   
We ’ll put pieces together and find a way forward , but it ’s going to take a week or two at a minimum .
” I nodded .
“
Did you make it out
okay , Victoria ?
” she asked .   
“
Your team ?
”
“
More or less .   
We ’re not really a team .   
We ’re mostly going our separate ways .
”
“ Your two friends with the court appointments .   
The others are attending court ?   
Sitting together again ?
”
“
Yes .   
Probably .   
Are your colleagues going to be the ones prosecuting them , down the road ?
”
“
I ’m a lawmaker more than a prosecutor these days .   
But no , nobody I know directly , I ’m fairly sure .   
That was n’t what I was driving at .   
For a team that ’s going its separate ways , you seem to be traveling in the same direction with regularity .
”
I raised my hand , my thumb hooking on my sling in my best folded - arms posture .   
I gave her a frown to match .
“ I do n’t know the reasons for the group breaking up , Victoria , and I ’m not going to pry , but I get the impression you want to stay together .   
We need heroes and we need heroes that work together .   
Really .
”
Great .   
The mom lecture .
“
Do n’t roll your eyes at me , Victoria .
”
“ I was n’t , ” I said .
“ You wanted to .   
Am I right ?   
Does the group have gravity that pulls you all together ?
”
“ To some extent , ” I said .
“ Most groups naturally fall apart despite the work they put in to stay together .   
To some extent , your group wants to stay together despite the work it ’s putting in to fall apart .   
It ’s rare to have ties or bonds like that , and that ’s something I ’ve missed every day for the past four years .
” I nodded .
“ I can tell you that the Victoria I had a heated conversation with a few weeks ago would n’t have held her own in that crowd just now .
”
“ It ’s not really progress , ” I said .
“
I ’ve noticed it , ” she said .   
“ Two steps forward and one step back is infinitely better than standing still .   
I know you
and I think you know deep down what you need to do
to truly take off .
”
“ Speaking of , ” I said .   
I saw her smile change .   
“ I should go .   
I do n’t want everyone to be late for her .   
The motherly pep talk was … nice .
”
“ I ’ll settle for nice .   
I ’m working with limited information , you know .
”
“
It was nice ,
” I said , stressing the was , and I actually meant it .   
“
It ’s just hard to find the words for it .
”
Hard to articulate , really , when we walked a razor ’s edge .   
She ’d toed or tested the waters .   
I had no idea whether it was inadvertent or not .   
I did n’t feel like I could have another conversation with her and know it could be this … inoffensive ?
“
You are strong , brilliant , capable and beautiful , Victoria .   
You know what you need and want to do .   
For reasons you have n’t shared with me , or for reasons you have shared that I ’ve apparently failed to understand , you ’re holding yourself back from that .
”
“ This is getting out of the territory of the pep talk and into the realm of criticism .
”
“ Take care of your team , Victoria .   
Just … take care of yourself too , you deserve it .   
Work to make sure it carries on being a positive thing , and do n’t make the mistakes I did .
”
My mom , admitting to mistakes ?
“
Do n’t let this stuff interrupt or override you and what you need to be focusing on .   
I can tell you , that leads to disaster and regret .   
Okay ?   
Do n’t ignore what you need and want , like this team of yours , and do n’t lose sight of what matters , of you .   
Promise me that ?
”
I raised up off the ground , because I really did need to be going .   
“
It ’s not a team , really .
”
“
If you insist .   
Still , Take care of yourself , prioritize yourself .   
Promise ?
”   
Her tone was pointed .
“
Sure .   
I promise , ” I said .








⊙ I do n’t know how I ’m going to help these guys , Jessica .
I found myself actually hesitating before approaching Sveta , Tristan and Chris .   
The group had lost two of its members and its mentor in a matter of nine days .
Kenzie was missing , I noted .   
She was always early , barring extraordinary event .   
Worrying , when she was first or tied for first place among those I was most concerned about-
she had just lost her friend , or whatever it was that Ashley was to her .   
Hard to pin down .   
That was the first half of it .   
The second half was the underlying threat within this group that Jessica had been so concerned about .
What do I even do ?
The big question mark shaped space where Kenzie was supposed to be was enough for me to get over my hesitation .
They were standing at the top of a set of concrete stairs .   
The stairs were supposed to lead up to a shopping center , the sort of building that had a mall on the ground floor and in the basement and offices for the second floor and above .   
It had been looted on a prior occasion , and now the doors and display windows were boarded up , shutters closed where the shutters were intact .
Sveta had started painting her body again , now that the court proceedings were done .   
Forest green , again , with teal blues for the select details and animals .   
It was only partial , and she used the negative , unpainted space in a neat way , with a mandala or kaleidoscope pattern to what was painted and what was n’t .   
Her top was another of the simple tops with knots at each shoulder and below each armpit ; there was a navy blue base to the cloth and more teal for the lettering around an anchor design .   
Her pants looked like sweats .   
Her feet were ‘ bare’ , being only the prosthetic feet , and I could see where the tops of the feet were painted , the toes left alone .
Tristan had a white jacket on over a crimson top , jeans so faded they were almost white , and white sneakers .   
He had n’t found the time to apply more paint to his hair , it seemed , and he had n’t shaved .   
I could see the faint shadow , even from a distance .
And Chris was … very much Chris .   
His hood was up and his hoodie zipped up all the way .   
He had dark circles under red eyes , his braces were on and looped around his head , and he had a different set of headphones on , with a forward - sweeping bar that clipped to the front of his hood .   
It looked a bit like he ’d done it himself , and I was left to wonder just why he ’d wanted to keep his head that securely covered .
The pressure differential between portals was responsible for strong wind on a good day , these days .   
Clouds and weather came rolling through with little warning beyond what the scientists on the far side could figure out .   
Today was n’t such a good day-
there were two portals in reasonably close proximity here and the two played off each other to make the wind issue twice as bad as it might otherwise be .
The tallest buildings were swaying .   
It was bad enough of a gale that there was n’t much traffic on the road or sidewalks .   
I was forced to fly close to the ground .
“
Heya , ” Sveta said , as I flew over to join the group , staying near to the ground .   
She reached out for my good arm and gave it a squeeze .   
I shifted position and gave her a better one - armed hug .
“
Where ’s Kenzie ?
” I asked .
“ She ’s running late , ” Tristan said .   
“
And this is her neighborhood .
”
“
And it ’s her project
we ’re here to see , ” Chris said .
“
Did you guys call her ?
” I asked .
“
Moment I arrived and she was n’t here , ” Tristan said .   
“
No response .
”
“
It ’s ominous , ” Chris said .   
“
I would say something about the sky falling , but there ’s already a Chicken Little out there .   
I ’d say something about the world coming to an end , but that joke got tired a year ago .
”
“ Not really a joke , that last one , ” Tristan said .
“ Meh .   
There ’s a warlord out there with the fire - to - ice shtick and a demon mask , and I ’d bet money he did it
so he could make the reference every chance he got .   
I ca n’t use ‘ hell freezing over’ because it ’s tainted with that guy ’s suck .
”
“
He sounds Fallen , ” Sveta said .
“
No , ” I said .   
“ Just a douche .
”
“ We ran out of good names and now all the good themes and ideas are being taken or spoiled , ” Chris complained .   
“
I have no fancy way of saying ‘ that kid is never late’ .
”
“ Kid ?
” Tristan asked .   
“
You ’re only two years older than her .
”
“
She ’s way more of a kid than I am , ” Chris said .
“ I do n’t know , Chris , ” I said .   
“
I think she has the edge when it comes to certain kinds of maturity .   
Work ethic , maintaining the relationship pillars …
”
“
What the hokey garbage fuck is a relationship pillar ?
” Chris asked .
“ … and
she ’s more polite ,
” I said , teasing .   
“
The pillars are honesty , trust , respect , caring , sharing …
”
Chris withered like he was in physical pain , a vampire exposed to the cross , hissing through his teeth and braces .
“
She ’s pretty on the ball with that stuff , ” I said .   
I craned my head and flew up until my feet were just above the others’ heads , so I could try to spot Kenzie .   
Chris continued hissing .
He was very good at his inhuman sounds .
He stopped hissing to say , “ I regret asking .   
I miss Ashley and Rain already .   
Without them to balance out the group , we ’re going to end up getting back together as team Caramel Friendship with tramp stamps like the Love Bugs have .
”
“ I hate that term , ” Tristan said .   
“ ‘ Tramp stamp’ .
”
“
It ’s a label for a reason , ” Chris said .
“ I had a crush on a guy in high school who had a lower back tattoo , and he was n’t a ‘ tramp’ , ” Tristan said .   
“
It gets me when I think of that term getting thrown around and an awesome guy getting shit because of it .
”
“
He should have paid more attention , then , ” Chris said .   
“
His fault .
”
“
Let ’s not fight , ” I said .   
“ Kenzie .   
At what point do we spread out and hunt for her ?
” I asked .
“
Soon , ” Tristan said .   
“
I thought we ’d give her ten minutes , and that was four minutes ago .
”
There was a pause .   
The wind whipped past us .
I was hoping they ’d put up a nice structure around each portal , to control the pressures and block the wind .   
I was n’t sure of the logistics of it , but it would be really nice to fly again without it being the effort it was now .
“ I ’ve never seen Love Bugs , ” Sveta commented .
Chris snorted , “ Count yourself lucky .   
The younger kids at the institution are always watching that kind of crap .   
It ’s so high pitched
it sets my nerves on edge when my senses are n’t heightened .
”
“
Are the Love Bugs the ones with sayings and puns around their symbols , like scrollwork on a coat of arms ?
” Tristan asked .   
“
I wonder if there ’s a good goat
pun I could do for my Caramel Friendship team
lower back tattoo .
”
“
That ’s a different show , ” Chris said .   
“
I ca n’t tell you how much I hate that I know that .
”
Tristan ’s watch beeped .   
He sighed .
“ Time to swap ?
” I asked .
He nodded .   
“
Better go look for Kenz .   
Make sure she did n’t get mugged or blown away in this wind .
” Chris snorted .
“ Hey Byron , ” Tristan said .   
“
I ’ll give you three hours later if you give me an hour now .
”
He changed , blurring .   
Byron appeared , and immediately had the wind blow his hair into his face .   
He fixed it .   
He was n’t wearing a jacket , only a thin sweatshirt that was more for the hood and graphic than for the warmth , black skater pants , and sneakers .   
Between the dip in temperature and the wind , he should have reacted more to the chill .   
I supposed his temperature resistance helped .
“
Nah , ” Byron said .   
“
Feels weird , Trist , you coming out this way when you had almost no time left .   
I know it ’s not far , but
… ”
He shrugged .   
“
Going to play it safe and stick to the routine .
”
“
It ’s good to have you with us , Byron , ” I said .   
“
We do n’t talk enough .
”
“
I ’m here when Tristan is .
”
“
You have us at a disadvantage , then , ” I said .   
“
You know us
and we do n’t know you .
”
“
Guess
so .
”
“
Are you leaving or will you stay ?
” Sveta asked .
Byron made a face .
“
Stay , ” she said , punching him lightly in the arm .
“
Okay .   
Sure .   
I ’ll help look , and compromise for Tristan .
”
“
Which way is her house ?
”
I asked .
Nobody knew , so we had to get phones out .   
All three of us looked .
“
Got it , ” Chris said .
“
Damn it , ” I said .   
He ’d won the race .
At a glance , Byron did n’t seem to care one way or the other , but he was a hard guy to read .
Chris turned on the spot , then pointed .
“
You guys go straight , Sveta go more left , I ’ll go right ?
”
I asked .
That got multiple nods of affirmation .
As I got ready to take off , checking for traffic , since I did n’t want to fly high , I heard Byron in the background .   
“ Tristan , was your crush Jhett Marion ?   
Was n’t it a roleplaying game tattoo ?   
He had back hair when he was fourteen .
” Chris cackled .
I shook my head .   
Poor Tristan .
The areas where the portals had opened up were in worse shape than the others .   
People had reacted , and the violent reaction was only a small part of things .   
Some had realized their close call and moved away from the portals that could potentially expand again .   
Abandoned property , harsher weather , and the fact that a lot of the constructions had been rushed meant that there was a kind of decrepitude setting in .   
Debris , trash , broken windows , and the occasional door left open .
I imagined there were people out there who would have happily claimed the empty houses , even with the proximity to the portal , but it was the same kind of dynamic as in Hollow Point .   
In a lot of places , the people that had abandoned properties had n’t gone through official channels or put up listings to let others know the properties were available .
One street , a bus parked to block off the road , with another two vehicles parked further down that same road .   
It was there , it seemed , to break the wind that would have blown straight into the main road through Norwalk Station .
I did one loop , seeing only crowds and countermeasures .   
There were signs warning that the main road was blocked by the portal , with instructions for detours and flow .   
The signs had been hastily put together .
A flash in the distance got my attention .
That would be her .
Four people were blinded and sitting on their asses , backs to the wall .   
Kenzie was there , uncostumed , her face blurred .
“
Everything
okay ?
” I asked .
The blur faded away and Kenzie smiled .   
“
I ’m good !   
Except I ’ve been waiting way too long .
”
“
We ’ll talk about that in a second .   
Who are these guys ?
”
“
I ’m blind !
” one shouted .   
“ New person , help !
”
“ They wanted what I was carrying , and I said no .   
They insisted , I shot ’em .   
I set it to a two .
”
“
There are settings ?
”
“ They ’ll be blind for two hours .   
Where were you all ?   
I was lonely , geez .
”
“ We were waiting at the stairs of the financial building , where the mall closed up .
” Kenzie smiled .   
“
What ?   
No .   
I sent a new location .
”
“ Check again .
”
She did , fishing out her phone .   
“
Do n’t try running just because I ’m not looking or aiming at you .
”
She fiddled with her phone .   
She wore a blue polo top with heart - shaped buttons down the collar and a pink stripe across the chest .   
She had a pink skirt , blue leggings , and an hourglass hairpin .   
Her eyehook extended out from her belt , and she had her flash gun dangling from her pinky .
The box she ’d brought for the day was sitting beside her .   
It was just large enough that I imagined it had to be inconvenient .   
Larger than a backpack , just broad and tall enough that holding it by the handles on either side had to be a pain .   
Kenzie was n’t fully grown , either .
The box had been painted to match her outfit , it seemed .   
Two triangles with one point touching formed an hourglass shape , and that shape repeated across the box , from a predominantly pink hue at one corner to a deeper blue at the opposite corner .
“ I like the color matching , ” I said .
“
My outfit ?
”
she asked , typing at her phone .   
She smiled .   
“
They were my back to school clothes .   
I like them .
”
I tried my phone , sending a message to the others , to let them know where we were .   
I saw the tiny red warning icon on each text message I sent .   
“ My messages are n’t going through .
”
“
That ’s what ’s going on , ” Kenzie said .
One of the thugs who ’d tried to rob Kenzie lurched to his feet , then ran , blind , down the street .
“ Cell towers might be struggling , ”
I said , while I kept an eye on the guy .
Kenzie did n’t look up from her phone , but her eyehook turned to track the runner .
The guy did n’t run in a straight line , and as he veered , he ran straight into a pile of trash , tripping heads over heels .
The others who remained looked alarmed at the noise that caused .
“
What the hell are you guys doing , mugging a kid ?
”
“
We were n’t mugging her .   
We were questioning her .
”
“ And demanding my box , ” Kenzie said .
“
There ’s so much going wrong , you mentioned the cell towers .   
That ’s been breaking as fast as we fix it .   
The power ’s fucked and we ’re getting blackouts , and some food that was supposed to be delivered was n’t .   
Now some kid turns up with suspicious stuff ?
” I looked at Kenzie .   
She shrugged , saying , “ The power outages are n’t that bad .   
I dunno about the other stuff .   
Looks like the cell towers are off .   
I connected online , though .   
I ’m
stealing someone
’s internet .
”
“ Their story does n’t jar with what they said to you ?
” I asked .
“
No , but if they were telling the truth then they were major jerkasses about it .
”
“
We heard the portal was broken by a group of people .   
We ’re keeping an eye out .   
Neighborhood watch thing .
”
“ You ignored a bunch of other people and came after me instead , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Is it because I ’m a kid ?
”
“ You were carrying a weird colorful thing !
”
“
Weird thing aside , ” I said .   
“ I mean , come on , guys .   
She ’s got ta be the least threatening person you ’ll run into in the next while .   
She ’s , what , five feet tall and ninety pounds ?
”
“
Close !   
Eighty - one and a quarter pounds ,
” Kenzie whispered .   
“ Four feet ten and a half inches .   
But thank you for thinking
I ’m bigger and taller .   
I ’m flattered .
”
“ You ca n’t know , ” the guy said .   
“
Maybe they got away with it because they were kids .   
Parahumans are dangerous , they could be anywhere .
”
Another of the guys said , “ Young ones are more dangerous if anything .   
They do n’t have the impulse control .
”
“ Even if that was eerily accurate and true , you guys were nasty about it , ” Kenzie said .   
“
That was n’t okay .
”
“ Fuck , ” one said , under his breath .
The guy who ’d tripped over the trash had n’t quite found his feet .   
He tripped over the trash he ’d knocked off of the pile , falling again .
I walked over to him , grabbed him by the scruff , and dragged him back to the others .   
Kenzie had approached too , but it was n’t to help the guy .   
She used her eyehook to pick up the trash .
“
We were the ones who helped stop the portal thing from being worse , you dingbats , ”
I said .   
“
Do you want to make this a thing , Looksee ?   
We could arrest them .
”
“ Nah .   
I think they learned not to mug potential capes .   
And to be nicer , right ?   
Do n’t call people names or go straight to being rough .
”
“
Not mugging , ” the guy I ’d just brought back to his friends said .   
“
We were investigating and looking out for trouble .
”
“
I ’m trying to be nice , ” she said .   
“ You keep arguing points or swearing instead of saying sorry .   
Maybe we should call the police after all .
”
For all the good that ’ll do .
The men gave their apologies in near - unison .
Kenzie nodded , satisfied .
Her face and hair briefly went blurry again as someone drove past .
“
Do you guys have a number I can try calling ?
” I asked .   
“ Or an email we can send ?   
We ’ll call someone to pick you up .   
You ’ll get your eyes back in two hours .
”
They gave me an email .   
Kenzie sent the message to the families of the blinded men .
“
I asked before , ”
I said , my voice quiet .   
“
Are you okay ?   
With Ashley ’s pre - court proceeding not going well , same for Rain , the group being in a weird place , how are you holding up ?
”
“
I ’m holding , ” Kenzie said , smiling .   
“ Ashley told me to be tough , so I ’m being tough .   
I ’m
focusing more on my stuff , but it ’s a good distraction .
”
“ You ’re sleeping
okay ?   
Eating okay ?
”
“ Not sleeping , but nothing too bad .   
I ’m staying up until midnight , sometimes one or two in the morning .   
Working on stuff like my box here .   
I was working on Tristan and Byron ’s thing too
, I have some stuff that has a one percent chance of working , max , and
it would be video only if it worked , but it would maybe let us see Byron while Tristan is out and vice versa .
”
“ Eating ?
”
“ Eating !   
That reminds me .   
Do you want to come over sometime soon ?
”
“ I ’ll answer your question if you answer mine .
”
“ I eat .   
Three regulars .   
My parents were always very big on sitting down and eating as a family .   
Unless it ’s an emergency , I do n’t miss dinner .
”
I ’d told myself I wanted to check on them .   
This worked .   
I could remember how horrified the others had been at the prospect of my going over to her place for dinner , but this seemed important .
“
Then yes , I ’ll come over .
”
“ Tonight or tomorrow ?   
Do you have a preference for what to eat ?
”
“
Sure , and no preference for day or food .   
Just let me know , and double check that the message got through .   
I do n’t want to miss this because of a missed message .
”
“ Will do , ” she replied , with all the seriousness she would have shown if she were receiving a field order .
“ I ’ve got to say , it ’s concerning , if people are reading this failure of infrastructure as sabotage .
”
“ For sure .
”
Our guys showed up around the same time the vigilante ’s backup did .   
We left them to their backup with a brief explanation , then walked in the direction of Sveta , Chris , and Byron .   
Because the box was heavy - ish and I only had the one hand , I took one handle and Kenzie took the other .
We explained in brief .
“
Your dad did n’t give you a ride ?
” Byron asked .
“
He ’s busy with stuff .   
His work is n’t doing
so great right now , ” she said .   
“
My mom wants to move but ca n’t find a good place to go .   
I ’m not too bothered .
”
“ You brought a thing ?
” Chris asked .
Kenzie gave her box a pat .   
“ We do n’t have far to go .   
At first I thought we ’d use the abandoned shopping center , but I think we ’ll get better results at this place .   
It ’s managed by a real estate company that ’s rivals with my dad
’s .   
We kind of have to break in .
”
“ Sweet , ” Chris said .
“
Not sweet , ” Byron said .   
“ Concerning .
”
“ Concerning on multiple fronts , ” I agreed .
“
Can you go with me on this ?
” she asked .   
“
It ’s a good location , not too much noise , I think , and I ’m super - duper eighty , seventy , mayyybe
sixty percent sure this is going to be totally worth it .
”
“
What are you up to ?
” I asked .
“
Nothing !   
Nothing .   
Field test .   
It ’s hard to get optimal conditions , targets , and stuff .   
I still need to fine tune .
”
“
She ’s up to something , ” Byron said .
“
No !   
Yes !   
But not in a bad way !
”
“ Kenzie , ” Sveta said .   
“
What are you doing ?
”
“ Please ?   
I ’ve worked so hard on this project , and the idea of this moment with the flashy reveal and
everything has been keeping my mood up since one of my favorite people got sent to a cape gulag .
”
“
It ’s a block of buildings in an isolated area , with heavy supervision , limited time outdoors , and explosive trans - dimensional ankle monitors , ” I said .   
“
It ’s not that uncomfortable .
”
“ Has to have slave labor to be a gulag , ” Chris said .
Kenzie tried her best puppy dog eyes .
“ If we caved to this , what kind of precedent would we be setting ?
” Sveta asked .
“
It ’s not even good puppy dog eyes , compared to what you could really do , ” I said .   
“
At least step up your game .   
Give us a quivering lip .   
Change your posture , here , like this
…
”
I adjusted her stance , having her draw her shoulders together , hands clasped in front of her .   
I changed the angle of her chin .   
Kenzie made her lip quiver , then said , “ This could be the last thing we do as a team .
”
I shook my head .   
“
Too much .
”
“ B.S. , by the way , because we ’re more likely to fizzle out than just stop today .   
Unless this is a huge fuckup , ” Chris said .   
“ Try harder .
”
“
It ’s illegal , ” Byron said .
Her composure broke .   
“ Come on !   
It ’s too much and
it ’s not enough   and
it ’s illegal ?   
Cut me some slack !   
You know I ’d do something quasi - illegal for any and all of you , any time .
”
“
That ’s not a good thing !
” Sveta said .
“
It ’s also fully illegal , not quasi - illegal , ” Byron pointed out .   
“ Breaking and entering , criminal trespass .
”
“
But it is a good thing , right ?
”
Kenzie asked .   
“
Actually , it ’s very much a good thing because you ’re good guys .   
You would n’t ask me unless you thought it was for the greater good .   
And I ’m asking you because I think this is for the greater good .   
I ’m
asking for the benefit of a doubt .
”
“ I have so many doubts when it comes to you , ” Chris said .
“
Ha ha , ” Kenzie said , smirking .   
“
Keep teasing .   
I bet I can shoot you at least three times and give you a wedgie with my eyehook before you can transform .
”
“
You ’re only proving my point .
”
“ Kenzie , ” I said .   
“
You ca n’t hold back on this for the dramatic potential when it ’s illegal .   
Dish .
”
She fidgeted .
“ I think I found something .   
I want to see with my cameras , and I want you guys to be a part of it .   
If you are n’t , then I might not be able to explain it after .
” I looked at the others .
“
It might be big , ” Kenzie said .
“
You ’re , how did you put it ?   
Mostly sixty percent sure it ’s maybe totally worth it ?
” I asked .
“
Something like that .   
Fifty … seven percent sure .
”
“
Alright , ” I said .   
“
I ’ll try this .   
If the others do n’t want to , I ’m willing to risk it , since I have people I can ask for help .
”
“ I ’ll come , ” Sveta said .
“ I was good to go at the start , ” Chris said .   
“ I was less convinced the more you talked , Kenz .
”
“ Ha ha .
”
“ I ’ll hang back , ” Byron said .
He was the only one to duck out .   
He followed us , up until we reached the destination , and then went for a walk around the block .
The building was a nice place , with brass capped white pillars at the outside .   
It looked like a hotel , stately , but there was no sign of any occupancy and the wear and tear of age that I ’d noted earlier seemed to have caught the outside , leaving it dusty and plastered with a few pieces of trash that had blown up against the building face and then stuck there with residual grime , dust , and rain .
“
This place has a keypad lock , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I was thinking of the shopping center , that would work too , but getting inside would be hard .   
Instead … ” She slapped a box the size of a smartphone onto the side of the front door keypad , tapped it once , and then pushed the door open .
“
It ’s concerning just how naturally you did that , ” I said .
“ Pshh .
”
I helped her lift the box .
“
What ’s concerning is that she probably spent four hours building that , instead of looking up one of the thousands of tutorials online on how to break a keypad lock , ” Chris said .
“
One and a half hours , thank you very much .   
Except it was closer to three because I was splitting my attention between watching television , homework , and building that .
”
“
So pretty close to four hours , then ?   
Or are you doing that thing where you took three hours to get it technically finished , and another half an hour to build a nice case that matched the outfit you were going to wear today ?
” Kenzie sighed .
“ Or
was it forty five minutes ?   
Was it an actual hour ?   
Was I actually right on the nose with my guess about it taking four hours total ?
”
“
It was twenty minutes to build the case , you booger .   
I made resin and glassworking machines since I like my work to look nice
and I make a lot of lenses .   
It cut down on the time , even if it wastes material if I ’m not paying attention .
”
“ I was close , ” he gloated .
“
You were sorta close , you booger .
”
Sveta let her hand drop to the floor .   
She brought it back up , a cigarette butt clasped between two fingers .
“ People have been here , ” I said .
“ They might still be here , ” Sveta said .
“ Hmmm , ” Kenzie said .   
She consulted her phone .   
“
This way .
” ‘ This way’ was to the penthouse , which took up the entirety of the fourth floor .   
The stately , crimson - carpet , white - pillar look was in full force for the open concept room .
The window was open and the fierce wind blew the sheer curtains into the room .   
Even the heavier crimson velvet curtains were moving .
Cigarettes littered the floor by the window .   
The wind had blown them and the ash across the floor , and moisture or humidity had given the cigarettes and their ash enough dampness to run and stain the tiled floor beneath them .
Kenzie indicated for the box to go down .   
We eased it to the floor .
“ I hope this works , ” she said .
She traced her finger along the pattern at the top of the box , zig - zagging across the surface .
Colored particles , each spherical and about an inch across , began to fill the room .   
It was seemingly random at first , but slowly , patterns began to emerge .
“
So .   
My focus is on space , not time , and this is wonky , ” she said .   
“
So , initial capture is going to be all impressions since the date I specified .
”
Each figure was a smear that filled the room to the point things got dark .   
Skin - tone spheres began to cluster into groupings that looked like faces , but where one person walked across the room , every space that their face had occupied began to get the dots .
The room filled to the point that it began to get dark .   
The faint ambient glow of each dot became more apparent .
“
This is messy , ” Chris said .
“ Yep .
”
Finer dots began to appear , piercing the larger ones and replacing them in clusters .   
It took minutes , and I was reminded of using the internet in recent months , when the servers were first going online .   
Each image load had taken twelve passes , each pass taking a minute or two .
It was n’t only resolution that mattered , though .   
Each person had been in the room for extended periods of time , and each one was a smear of every action and movement they ’d taken while in the space .
I folded my arms , walking around and through images , looking for ones where a face stuck out without smearing one way or the other .
“ Color is n’t accurate , by the way , ” Kenzie said .
“
Good to know , ” I said .
One face , a woman , strawberry blonde , with one tattooed arm .   
I could see the impression she ’d left where she had slept on the edge of the bed , but had climbed off the bed on the opposite side .
I could see other activity , with a lot of flesh tones .
Going by profile , there were two men , and there was another woman who was n’t present much .
“
And … resolution is as good as it ’s going to get , ” Kenzie said .   
“
But some are sharper than others , where one person or thing was still for a very long time .   
Sleeping faces and stuff .
”
I peered down at the sleeping face of the woman .
“
Who are these guys ?
” I asked .
“ Give me … five , ten minutes .   
Maybe fifteen or twenty .   
I want to sweep and see what we can pick up .
”
Thin lines that formed cubes began to dance around the room , seemingly at random .   
Where each cube touched a face , they began to roll along the track formed by each blurry caterpillar of merged images , pausing now and again .
There was one , however , that was n’t looking for faces .   
It moved along the chest of dressers , pausing on the bible that lay on one shelf .   
It went over to the television , then the VCR .   
The longer it wandered , the more frantic and jerky it seemed to get .
It settled on the box Kenzie
and I had hauled into the room .
“
Oh my god , you stupid box , ” Kenzie said .   
“
No , I do not need you to find yourself .
”
She kicked the box .
The cube - frame continued to dance around the room .
“
You know you ’re absolutely terrifying , right ? ”
Chris asked .
“ You can turn into a spider - face .   
You can turn into a blob of brain tissue and tentacles .   
You have a rage form , ” Kenzie said .
“
And yet you ’re way scarier than I am .
”
“
Who are these people ?
” Sveta asked .
I continued to walk around the room , studying the men .   
The other woman was too blurry to make out , her visits too fleeting .   
From the way one man danced around the door , he might have repeatedly gone out with her .
Dark hair , dark clothes , pale face , dark eyes or sunglasses , for her .
One man had a red hat , it looked like .   
The other was bald .
While I stared , the door opened .   
Byron came in .
“ Change your mind ?
” Chris asked .
“ I saw the dots outside .   
I came to see what you were doing , ” Byron said .
“
I ’ll clean that up before anyone else notices , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Probably picking up birds .
”
She fiddled for a bit .
“
No , stupid box !
” Kenzie said .   
The cube - frame had settled on the box again .   
She kicked the box twice .
“ Watch .   
You ’re going to destroy that thing through your percussive maintenance , ” Chris said .
“ Am not .   
I know how it works .   
Aha !   
Thank you , box .
”
The cube - frame had settled on the table by the window .   
A silver and black smear covered most of the table .   
Now the cube danced through the smear .
“
Aaaand isolating , ” she said .   
“
I ’m going to pull out the best images , going by what seems to be the most accurate .   
Medians and modes .
”
The    woman ’s image at the edge of the bed remained , while the rest of her disappeared .
There was another image of her on the bed .   
She was in the middle of coitus with the bald man .
Sveta made a sound as she saw it , and moved to block Kenzie ’s eyes .   
When the eyehook looked over Sveta ’s head , she pulled it down .
“ I need to see to take it down .   
There .   
We do n’t need that , thank you , ” Kenzie said .   
She tapped the top of the box .   
The image disappeared .
“
You ’re going to be so much scarier when you ’re older , ” Chris said .
“
Well , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Probably .   
I ’m hoping to get a handle on things before then .
”
“
Breaking and entering and getting footage of people in bed is n’t progress , ” Byron said .
“
This is important , ” Kenzie said .   
Her expression was serious .
We had our images .   
Kenzie had saved three to four images of each person , as they stood in the room .
The strawberry blonde with tattoos down her arm wore a cat mask and a bodysuit , as she leaned against the wall .   
The bald man wore war paint .
The man with the dyed red hair was someone I ’d met before , if only briefly .   
He was the smoker , and he ’d slept sitting up in the armchair .
“ Kingdom Come , ” I said .   
“
I ran into him at the community center .
”
“
Yep , ” Sveta said .   
“ Might explain why Norwalk went south .
” I nodded .
There was no ID or good resolution on the woman at the door .   
Too much movement , not enough of a stay .
The images were n’t a snapshot .   
The woman and Kingdom Come had been captured sleeping .   
The bald man had tossed and turned too much to be captured at any one point while he slept , so the best resolution was when he ’d sat eating .    
Even though the images froze in time , they were out of sync , each one at a different moment .
“ You knew who they were already , ” I said .
“ I had some idea .   
This place and the mall were the big locations where they made calls to and from , in the big network of call locations for this group , ” Kenzie said .
On the table by the window , the blur had solidified into a concrete image .   
It was clearest of them all , to the point it looked real .   
Human faces moved and adjusted , but the rectangle was static in shape , inflexible .
It was the tinker device that had blown up the portal .   
This would presumably be the one that had successfully been used on the Norwalk portal .
“ You wanted to rope us into this by showing us this scene , ” I said .   
“
It ’s a lead .   
A big lead .
”
“
Yeah , ” Kenzie said .
“
You ’re not pulling our legs ?
” Chris asked .
“
This was really tedious to do , ” she said .   
“ If I was going to pull your legs or try to get you all on board as a team , I ’d have done something easier and more fun .   
More convincing , probably .
”
“ Do n’t be dishonest to get us to stay together , ” I said .
“
Okay .   
I was n’t dishonest this time .   
This is real .
”
We walked around the room , looking at the culprits .
“
Um .   
Did it work ?
”
“
Yes , ” Sveta said .
“
Yep , ” Chris said .
“
Fuck
yeah ,
this worked , ” I said .   
“
I want to get these assholes .
”
I glanced at Byron
and I saw him nod .








The shopping floor of the financial building gradually illuminated as the adjustable lights and shutters were replicated by the time camera .   
It made for an unusual picture , where the shutters and the covers for the lights were closed but the light that passed through was painted as especially intense .
Meanwhile , on the floor of the center , the shadows of people passing through streaked the area , darkening it .   
The yellow of construction vests and hats cut through the darkness of clothing , some skin , and equipment being rolled through as the building was used as a shortcut .
The other members of the group were standing at higher vantage points- on the stair - like ledges at the edges of the shopping floor
’s main concourse , and on the stone edge around the simple fountain .   
Having the higher ground let them see over the heads of the blurs .   
Next to me , Kenzie had the best vantage point in the place , sitting on Byron ’s shoulders .   
The silent unfolding of the scene was punctuated by Byron telling her to stop wiggling so she would n’t fall .
I took the easier route and floated , trying to see the areas the camera covered that the others could n’t .   
There were people leaning in nooks and crannies , people sitting with papers beside them .
Most of the covert leaning was done by one construction employee , who carried an empty container and smoked , the ashes being tapped off into the container .   
Multiple instances of smoke became a gossamer haze that hid their face .
The papers littered the places where people grabbed lunch and did some reading .   
I flew past , noting the papers , and I saw ads for apartments , newspapers , and some kind of legal documentation that scanned as hazy with the way the time camera worked .
“
A lot of people pass through this supposedly abandoned area , ” Sveta said .   
“
I ’m
glad we called to ask for permission before breaking in this time , because this kind of traffic would have made it really dumb to try to sneak in .
”
“
They would notice the sea of blurry images before they noticed us , ” Chris said .   
“
Especially if any of those images have the same height and general shape as them .   
That ’s got ta be weird .
”
“
This is over a few weeks , ” Kenzie said .   
“
It ’s not actually
that many people .   
Wait until I run facial identification and thin it out .
”
“
I can picture one of these guys showing up .   
Hey , Leon the security guy , sorry to surprise you , we ’re just replaying footage of every single thing you did in this building since the start of September .   
Is that you scratching your butt there ?   
Then their jaws drop .
”
“
That would n’t happen , Chris , ” I said .
“
Do you think they ’d shoot the scary parahumans first and ask questions later ?
” Chris asked .
“ I think you would n’t say sorry , ” I said .
“ Ha !
”
“ Why did this place close down ?
” Sveta asked .   
She was peering into a store that still had a banner down the window , featuring some game character .   
I was n’t sure if it was a board game or video game .   
“
It looks like it closed down before the portal .
”
“ It was n’t built to fill a need , ” Chris said .   
“
It was put here to make things feel like the home we lost .   
It ’s a lot of upkeep and money to prop up something symbolic .
”
“
It ’s close to the station , stores look decent , ” I said , looking at the remnants of what used to be .   
A solid sign with plexiglass on it showed the stores the place had once had .   
“
It ’s fine for location , a little grocery store and pharmacy for the people in nearby apartment complexes , or anyone working upstairs coming down
… I do n’t think that ’s it .
”
“
It ’s already going to pieces , ” Byron said .   
He kicked at the stone boundary of the fountain he was standing on .   
A stone or two were missing .   
“ Problems , maybe .
”
“
That makes more sense to me , ” I said .   
A safety issue and forced evacuation .   
It would be easier to get established somewhere else than to try to fix anything expensive .
As the blurs stretched out like so many misshapen caterpillars , many of them yellow - striped from the hard hats and vests , I saw one blur in one of the stores .
I flew down to investigate .
Dark clothes , dark hair , and a consistent slash of darkness at eye level .   
Blurs intersected with her .
“
Can you focus your facial recognition program on any area ?
”
I called out .
“
Ummmm …
I have to finish first !   
Which is soon !
”
“
When you ’re finished ?
” I asked .
“ I can choose a place as a starting point , I can start it over there , ” Kenzie called out .   
Her voice echoed through the large space .   
“
I ’ll scan all of this before we ’re done , though .
”
“
Sure , ” I said .   
“
I think I found the woman with the sunglasses in
… I think this was a computer store .
”
“ Woo !
”
I folded my arm over the arm I still had in the sling as I walked around the perimeter of the computer store .   
I tried to assess what the woman with the sunglasses was doing .   
Something with computers and phones .   
There were enough points where papers and a laptop rested on one of the long wooden tables that the table was now a blur of her work material .   
No chair- she ’d worked from a standing position .
Was there a point where she stayed still for a long period ?
“
Done ! ”
Kenzie called out .   
“ Facial recognition one , live !   
Siccing it on the sunglasses woman for you , Victoria !
”
The cube - frame began dancing across the sunglasses woman ’s head , flowing around the room as it tracked her pacing around the computer store .
“ Facial recognition two , live !   
Chris’ man , Leon the security guy !   
Facial recognition three is a go !   
And because it ’s bratty , let ’s change priority , give it a headstart annnnd
… our fourth scan is live , looking for curious boxes .
”
“
Wait , ” I could hear Chris say .   
“
The reason it kept finding itself is because you told it to look for boxes ?
”
“ Under a certain size
, with certain internal properties , yeah .   
I told the compiler and the face and person searches to ignore you guys , but I forgot to make the box searcher ignore itself .   
Fifth scan live .
”
I stepped out of the store , glancing around .   
As the cubes danced through the streams and waves of people , some were eliminated , cutting up the caterpillars .
“
That answers one question and leaves me with so many more .   
These things see inside people ?
”
“ They can , ” Kenzie said .   
“
There is n’t much point though .   
There is a point when I ’m looking for tinkertech portal bombs .
”
“ If we identify any of our targets , do you think we could get a look inside them ?
”
“ You just want to see their underwear , I bet .   
So gross .
”
There was a pause .   
I could imagine Chris sighing .   
I was n’t close enough to hear , and my attention was focused elsewhere .
“
What are you looking for , Chris ?
” Byron asked .
“ The way people are put together is interesting , ” Chris said .   
“
I ’ll know it when I see it .
”
“
Can you do that , Kenz ?
” I asked .   
“ Give us a view of their insides ?
”
“
Sure .   
I guess .   
We ’ll try it when this part is done .   
The resolution might suck for things that are n’t normally visible , and I have to concentrate it on one area .
”
“ While you ’re at it , ” Chris said .   
“
Can you draw a line through everyone ?   
Keep the … however many images of people you want .   
But show the paths they traveled by giving each person a certain color of line that runs through their hearts or whatever ?
”
“ Belt buckle , maybe .   
People do n’t change belts that often
and they ’re nice and unique ,
yeah ,
I can , ” Kenzie said .   
She motioned for Byron to put her down , and then went to get her computer out .   
She was wholly focused on what she was doing , now .
“
You ’re surprising me with how into this you are ,
” Byron said , to Chris .   
Byron rubbed at his own shoulders , where Kenzie had been sitting .
“
It ’s interesting .   
This is neat , ” Chris said .   
Kenzie made a pleased sound , and Chris said .   
“
Do n’t go getting a big head just because I gave you a compliment .
”
“
It ’s neat that you think it ’s neat , ” Kenzie said .
“
Why the focus on the way they ’re put together and where they are , Chris ?
” Sveta asked .   
“
Are you looking for a shapeshifter or someone in disguise ?
”
“
Nah , ” Chris said , as he walked toward us , studying the security guy in passing .   
“
I ’m thinking outside the box , plus she shuts up when she ’s working hard on stuff .
” Kenzie snorted .
As the images started reducing down to a small enough number that people could walk between them without being blinded by the projections in their faces , the others stepped down from their vantage points , getting a look at our players in this scene .
“
How are you these days , By ? ”
Sveta asked .
“ Dealing .   
Some days I ’m fine , some days it catches up with me
and I ’m the furthest thing from ‘ fine’ .   
It ’s times like that where I think a lot about- ”   
He lowered his voice .   
“
-how there ’s not a lot of case seventies left .   
Even before Gold Morning , most were dead or they had totally gone off the deep end .
”
“ From one name in a numbered casefile to another , there are answers , ” Sveta said .   
“
It ’s the upside of things being as messy and complicated as they are .   
There ’s a lot of weirdness out there , there are a lot of capes , and there ’s tinkertech .   
There has to be a key to things out there .
”
I was left to wonder about that .   
Sveta maintained a kind of optimism I was n’t sure I held .   
When I thought about my own issues , which might have been smaller than the problems of the members of this team , I did n’t generally think of fixes .
I held my tongue .
Byron spoke in a way that made it sound like he had to work to bring himself to say it , “ It was easier when I could tell myself that we were researching it and reaching out to people who might be able to help or answer .   
Progress is slow lately , with less people to reach out to , communication being slower and more awkward …
”
“
I ’m
working on your thing , ” Kenzie said .   
She did n’t look up from her computer as she talked .   
“
I know
it ’s not a fix , but it ’ll give you options .
”
“
I appreciate the sentiment , Kenz , ” Byron said .   
“
You ’ve been working on that for a while , though .   
If it ’s too hard-
”
“
It ’s not too hard !   
It ’s just weird .   
If I had more scans of some specific cross - dimensional , intersectional sort of things , it would feel less weird .   
I ’ve had other things over the past few weeks , like this bratty time box , and then the cameras we used at the Fallen camp , for Rain , and Ashley ’s eye camera , and a bunch of other stuff .   
But I work on it every day .
”
“
Alright , ” Byron said .   
“
Thanks , Kenz .   
Do n’t agonize on it- if it ’s too hard , leave it .
”
Kenzie had to raise her voice to be heard from the other end of the concourse , “
It ’s fine .   
I could finish it in a day or two if I did nothing else .   
Do you want me to do that ?   
It would mean postponing other stuff , but I ’d do it for … if you ’d take me out for a treat .   
Thank me by taking me to get something nice at a restaurant or pastry shop .
”
“
It ’s a trap , ” Chris whispered .
“
Shut it , Chris , ” Kenzie said , her voice echoing .
I could see Byron ’s expression change .   
It was interesting just how distinct he was from Tristan .   
Tristan had a way of moving his arms and shoulders and showing his emotions in a whole - body kind of way .   
Byron contained it to his eyes and eyebrows , with the slightest of changes to his mouth , lips pressing together , eyebrows drawing together , while his eyes looked at nothing in particular .
He was tempted to say yes , I was ninety percent sure .
“
No , ” Byron said .   
“
Do what you need to .   
This is more important .
”
I could n’t hold my tongue .   
“ If you ’re actually thinking about death or losing it , Byron , that might warrant other people doing something .
”
“
I ’m not , ” he said .   
“
That ’s the bad moments , and in those moments , I can see how things might end up that way .
”
“
So you are thinking about those things .
”
“ Not directly .   
Besides , I ’d feel worse knowing you guys could be helping others and you were n’t because you were trying to make me feel better .   
I ’m
used to handling stuff myself , I ’ve gotten this far , I can keep going .
”
“ Introverts unite , ” Chris said .
“ You know you can always reach out to us , ” Sveta said .
“
Yeah .   
Thanks .
”
All around us , the images were condensing into an isolated few .   
There were some passing visits from other figures , I saw .   
the scans of the woman with the sunglasses had finished , and now that cube was searching out the infrequent visitors .
Kids snuck in , going straight to the stores .
Then Kingdom Come , the bald man , and the strawberry blonde woman with the sleeve tattoo .
I glanced at Byron .   
Sveta was investigating the group of the people we ’d seen in the penthouse apartment , Chris was looking over Kenzie ’s shoulder .
“
You were saying something about …
you did n’t want to dwell on your problem ,
” I said .   
“
You see other things as more important ?
”
Byron gave me a one - shouldered shrug .
“ I have some experience with that , ” I said .   
“ Not me , specifically .   
My-
my sister .   
She was like that .   
She did the introverted thing , doing stuff on her own .   
Dealing on her own .
”
“ You do n’t like talking about her .
”
“ I-
” I started , then I laughed , and the one - note laugh came out with a hitch , making it sound awkward .   
“ I really do n’t .   
Um-
yeah .   
It ’s easy to make that call , and then to make it again , and again , and again .   
I imagine you tell yourself that you can deal , like you said .   
You ’ve dealt so far , right ?
”
“
Right .
”
“
There will be bad days , Byron .   
Then something happens , and when you ’re in a position like you are , like my sister was , it does n’t take much to leave you unable to deal anymore .   
And where you could have asked for help before …
you ca n’t after you get to that point .
”
Byron nodded slowly .   
“
Yeah .
”
I looked away , and I could see that the others were listening in .   
No conversation between them .   
Whatever .   
It was fine .
“
Just , you know , be careful , ” I said .   
“
We ’re parahumans , the casualties are more numerous and grislier .
”
“
Yeah , ” he said .   
“
No , I get it , believe me .   
I have some experience with that already .
” I nodded .
My awareness of once having been a ‘ casualty’ made me feel uncomfortable .   
I ’d said my piece , and I tried to look casual as I checked the surroundings and flew off in the direction of the store with the woman
withw the sunglasses .
She stood over a laptop on the desk , gripping the edge of the table as her weight rested on the heels of her hands .   
Straight black hair in a utilitarian cut with straight - cut bangs and her hair tied back .   
She wore sunglasses , a black long - sleeved shirt , jeans , and black boots .
Her shirt was pulled over a bulge that had to be a gun .   
The image was fuzzy , but I could see the straps beneath her shirt .
That was her casual wear , as she was in this room … when ?   
Sometime between the passage of construction and the security patrols .
Another her was by the door of the computer store .   
She stood there , staring down at her phone , looking like she ’d settled in to stand there for a while .   
A different outfit .   
Nothing suggested she stayed here .   
Which made this , what ?   
It was her office ?   
A meeting place , with very few meetings ?
The refinement process had isolated the papers that had sat untouched on the desk the longest .   
Because they were the least necessary , they also had the least information .   
Envelopes had been torn open , left beneath stacks of other things that remained blurry or indistinct , with only company names or logos in the corner to set them apart .
I noted the wires that extended off the table to the wall .   
There were bags under the table .
“ We have our fourth target , I see , ” Sveta said .
“ Seems like , ” I said .   
“
I thought there was one laptop she moved around … but this is three laptops .   
The store was set up to have internet , power , and other things .   
There might have been leftover stock .   
She came here for the hookup .
”
The others caught up with us .
“
She hooked into this place
’s security , ” Kenzie said .   
“
The cameras moved to watch the entrances .
”
“
She made this a base of operations , ” I said .   
“ Computers , supplies , internet , power , entrances watched so she could bolt if she needed to .
”
“ The papers are n’t readable , ” Chris said .
I investigated them .
Construction company , agriculture supply , more agriculture , which might have been the same company-
I could n’t be sure .   
The name Mortari stood out to me .
Kenzie had her laptop tucked under one arm .   
She put it on the table , then typed a bit .
A pulsing pastel - purple line threaded its way through the room .   
The woman ’s course , or the snake reduced down to a simple line .
Not an easy to follow line , but it gave us a sense of things .
“
A lot of time at the door , ” Byron said .
“
Do you think we can do that deep scan ?
” Chris asked .
“
Yeah , ” Kenzie said .
The scan was localized into an area about four feet by two feet by two feet across .   
It was localized around the woman , and it took almost as long as the entire mall had .   
We all did our patrols , studying the images , came back , wandered off again .
From a pure curiosity standpoint , it was interesting to see the woman .   
People were dark inside , so Kenzie was forced to cast the image in black and white .   
From there , it was like seeing slices of an MRI scan or X - ray .
I ’d been right about the gun , I noted .
As the image filled in from the back forward , flickering violently at points , Chris got up onto the table , bending over .   
I flew to get a better look .
The front of the brain .   
The mind ’s eye .
“ Corona Pollentia , ” I said .   
“
She has powers .
”
“
We could have guessed that , ” Chris said .
“ They take different forms .   
There are n’t hard and fast rules .   
But I ’ve heard that if you trigger young , it takes more of a hold , with more … it ’s called dimpling .   
Like a hand is actually pressing it down into the brain .   
That right there looks like dimpling .
”
“
Creepy , ” Kenzie said .
“ You get more cloudiness in some kinds of scans where it expands out into the webbing around the brain , but we ’re not getting that .   
It ’s been way too long since I studied this , ” I said .   
“ The corona starts as a single marker , like a quarter - sized knot in wood , or a ball the size of a golf ball , pushed between the two lobes .   
Then when we trigger , it surges into life .   
It ’s part of the reason we black out .   
It expands slightly , veins swell .   
But most of the time an unactivated corona is hard to tell apart from an activated one , and a surprising number of people have unactivated ones .   
Sometimes you look at them and the larger veins or structures suggest what the power is linked to .
”
“
What does this tell us ?
” Chris asked .
“
She triggered young .   
It ’s deeper set .   
People who had a corona for a long time do n’t get dimpling ,
I ’m pretty sure .   
Looking at the veins , where it seems to have reached out … can you rewind ?   
Slowly go back , show us slices further back ?
”
“
Sure , ” Kenzie said .
We went further back .
“ Resolution ’s too blurry in parts , ” I said .   
“ Could n’t begin to guess .   
But going further back …
”
“
Going , ” Kenzie said .
There .   
That did n’t look right .
I searched on my phone , waited for a minute as it loaded , then held up the phone , comparing .
Veins or vein - like solid structures ran through one portion of the brain like the roots of a tree had been seeking nutrients .
“
The cerebellum , ” Chris said .
“
Right , ” I said .   
“
You apparently know more than I do on this .
”
“ I ’ve had to pay attention to it .   
If you go to a doctor
and they say your pancreas almost tore itself in half ,
then it ’s a great mnemonic for remembering the pancreas and what it ’s for .   
Cerebellum is senses , seeing , hearing , coordination of movement .
”
“ That makes me think of Mama Mathers , ” Sveta said .
“ If thinkers had an emphasis , I think it leans more toward frontal lobe .   
This could be a perception power , I guess .
”
“ I think we ’re pretty far into the weeds , ” Byron said .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
I still considered for a moment longer .   
“
What if she ’s a master , and that ’s … whatever control system she needs to manage her minions ?   
See , hear , coordinate ?
” “ Could be , ” Chris said .   
“
Okay , I did n’t want to say it , because it was my idea-
”
“
Good idea , ” Byron said .
“ -Yeah .   
But it took forever , and I ’m bored
, I got ta piss , and I ’m hungry , ” Chris said .   
He walked over the top of the table , stepping through things that were n’t really there .
“
We can wrap up soon , ” I said .   
“
The trails- the image of her standing at the door .   
Is it possible to find the time she was waiting and see if anyone was there around that time ?
”
“
Um .   
This is awkward , ” Kenzie said .
“
Awkward how ?
” I asked .
“
So , as you know , I work primarily with space .   
I ca n’t really know if any images are related in proximity in time because I did n’t gather any of that data .
”
“
You made a camera that can look through time , ” Chris was incredulous .   
“
How did you not implement timestamps ?
”
“ I bulk collected !
”
“
It ’s fine , ” I said .   
“ No stress .
”
“
It ’s a little stressful when he ’s giving me a hard time , ” Kenzie said .
“ Hypothetically speaking , is it possible to narrow down times of day ?   
Cut out every image that came up between two past midnight and four in the afternoon ?
”
“
No . ”
“ Or … days ?   
Limiting things to just the day before the attack ?
”
“
Maybe , but there might not be many good images .
”
“
We could simplify , ” Byron said .   
“
The lines .   
She was waiting here a lot .   
There ’s a scribbly sort of collection of lines here .
”
We stepped away from the image of the woman .   
Chris jumped down from the table he was standing on .
“
And the only other line that ’s really clustered here …
”
“
Leon the security guard , ” Chris said .
“
Whose name , ” Kenzie observed , before running over a few feet to where an image of Leon was stuffing a bag into the trash .   
“ Was … Durbin , according to the nametag .
” ⊙ Taz Durbin fidgeted .
He was outnumbered .   
A nineteen year old guy with a very dense growth of facial hair that had been short and the edges cut in exacting straight lines , creating an effect where it looked like it was fake .   
The hair around his temples and hairline was overly meticulous in the same way .   
He sat alone and he looked tired as hell .   
He worked nights , and this was firmly in the later hours of his sleep schedule .   
The cops had already questioned him , adding to how frazzled he was .
Sveta , Capricorn , and I were there , facing him down , with Chris and Looksee sitting by a table in the corner , sitting with Natalie .   
Capricorn was in goat - mode .   
Tristan .
Two of Foresight ’s members were also present .   
Effervescent was the cape with the unreliable emotion read who had helped scupper my interview for the team .   
Anelace was the dashing rogue who had tried to be nice about things .
The group was rounded out with three officers .   
Two stood in the corner by the door .   
The third was behind Durbin , an older guy who stood near the kids and Natalie .
“ You met the woman who was using the shopping center for a base of operations , ” Capricorn said .   
“
You knew she was there .
”
“
It was an office , I thought , ” Durbin said .   
“
I did n’t think it was doing any harm .   
She brought gas for the generator , she did n’t leave any mess .
”
“
She had access to security , ” Capricorn said .
“
I do n’t know anything about that .
”
“ You did n’t notice the cameras moved ?   
There was no part in your patrol where you ’d go to the security office , look at the monitors , and realize they were n’t pointed where they should be ?
”
The guy looked so scared .   
“
I did my job .
”
“
Answer the question , ” an officer said .
“
She paid me to look the other way .   
I looked the other way .   
I already admitted this .
”
“
She was one of the terrorists who blew up the Norwalk portal , ” Anelace cut in .
It was n’t the first time he ’d heard that , but the fear intensified as it was hammered in .   
I ’d seen that expression so many times when I ’d used my power , something with presence and magnitude taking hold of everything from heart to muscle to the dilation of the eyes .
I would n’t have gone straight for that .   
From the glance Capricorn shot me , he would n’t have either .
Still .   
Connections mattered .   
Information was currency , and we ’d decided it was essential to buy cooperation .   
Bringing Foresight in would help more in the long run .   
I hoped .
“ Taz , ” I said .   
“ You were n’t sympathetic with them , were you ?   
You were n’t happy about this portal thing ?
”
“
No !   
God no !
”
“ Then help us .   
Anything you can tell us about her , ” Capricorn said .
“ I don’t- I really do n’t know .   
Jesus , I ca n’t think .
”
“
Can I talk to you guys outside ?
”
Effervescent asked the cops .   
After a nod , she led them to the door .
Though Durbin turned to look at the reflective glass , aware that there were even more eyes on him , of a number he could n’t know , the people leaving the interrogation room served to lower the pressure .
I chose to back off , myself .   
Anelace and Capricorn could take point .   
I stepped off to the side .   
If needed , I ’d try to play nice .
“
Did she give you a name ?
” Capricorn asked .
Durbin shook his head .
“
How did she approach you ?
” Anelace asked .
“
She caught me on my way through the door by the elevators , ” Durbin said .   
“ Other entrances are boarded up .   
She asked if there was a place she could set up , and I thought she meant the offices above .   
I told her about having to talk to people upstairs
, I did n’t know anything , you know .   
She clarified , she wanted to be more discreet , do something less expensive than buying office space .   
Said it was to get her company up and running .
”
“
And she raised the subject of the gas ?
”
“ That was after .   
The power shuts off after a certain time .   
I do my patrol with my flashlight .   
After a few times when she lost her work , she said she ’d bring in gas for the emergency generator , she knew people .   
I thought it was great for both of us .
”
“
She offered you cash at first , then .
” Durbin nodded .   
“
Yeah .   
Not a lot .   
Not worth this .   
I bought myself sneakers with the money , after a few weeks .   
It ’s hard to get good shoes these days .
”
“
A few weeks ?   
How long total ?
” Capricorn asked .
“
Since … June , I guess .   
It was hot out when I first saw her , and it was late .   
I remember thinking about the fact that she was wearing black on such a warm evening .
”
“ Were you aware she was a parahuman ?
” Anelace asked .
“
No , no idea .   
Who is she ?
”
Anelace did n’t answer , instead glancing at Capricorn and I.
I was n’t sure I was a fan of how he kept giving up information on how much we knew , but I was n’t about to stop him or ask him to leave .   
Durbin was n’t a mastermind .   
He was n’t going to break or stop being able to testify .   
It was more a question of getting him to realize and parse just how much he knew .
“
What did you talk about ?
”
Capricorn asked .
“ Weather , stuff
I ’d seen on television , recent events .   
She ’d wait for me , hand me my cash , we ’d say one or two things .   
Sometimes she ’d ask when my relief was coming because she was planning on staying late .
”
“
You seem awfully cool with this arrangement , ” Anelace said .   
“ Nameless woman , random approach , gas from nowhere ?
”
“ I was happy to have my lights on while I did my route , a bit of pocket money , ” Durbin said .   
“
I thought it was a good thing , being able to see things and make sure nobody was hiding in the shadows , spot any vandalism , which there was n’t much .
”
“
It kind of defeats the purpose of having security if the security lets people into the building , does n’t it ?
”
Anelace asked .
Taz Durbin looked miserable .   
He nodded .
“
She did n’t tell you her name , she did n’t tell you where she was from , or anything about the business ?   
Was there any kind of marking on the can or barrel she used for the gas ?
” Capricorn asked .
“ Barrel .   
No .   
No mark that I saw .   
I think it was the same barrel every time .
”
“
What color was the barrel ?
” Anelace asked .
“
Uh .   
No idea .   
It was dark , and … light green ?   
Or gray ?
”
Witness testimony was bad when it came to things like that .
“
You never met her friends ?
” Capricorn asked .   
When Durbin shook his head , Capricorn pressed , “ You never saw anyone go in with her , or go in to see her ?
”
“
No . ”
“
Did you ever see her with her sunglasses off ?
” I asked .
Durbin looked startled at the question .   
He shook his head .   
“
No .   
She said she had a vision problem .   
Is that useful ?
”
“ Maybe .   
Could have been a lie .   
Some physical mutations might be hidden with sunglasses .
”
“ Could be , ” Sveta said .
“ Holy , ” Durbin said .   
“ Holy .   
I did n’t think she was dangerous .
”
“
Focus , okay ?
”
Capricorn told the shell - shocked guy .   
“ Were there any moments you had doubts ?   
Anything peculiar that put you off ?
”
“
She did her thing , I did mine , ” Durbin said .   
“
We talked for a minute a night , or not even .   
I did n’t want to interrupt her too much .   
She really did that with the portal ?
”
“
She was in contact with two other groups , ” Looksee said .   
Durbin had to twist around in the chair that was bolted to the ground in order to see her .   
“
I think she was coordinating three of the attacks .
”
“
Oh , ” Durbin said .   
Color leeched from his face .   
“
Yeah , that ’s …
God .
”
Capricorn tapped the table , and Durbin ’s head whipped around like Capricorn had slammed his hand down .
Capricorn ’s voice was gentle .   
“
Focus .   
You talked for a minute every night , right ?   
There could be clues in that .
”
“
We talked about weather , ” Durbin said .
“
Any mention of travel ?
”
Capricorn asked .   
“
Having to drive in the rain ?
”
Durbin shook his head .   
“
Was , like , aw , the weather ’s getting cooler .   
Nothing big .
”
“
What else , then ?   
What did you talk about ?
”
“ TV .
”
“ What shows ?
”
Capricorn pressed , insistent .
“
Uh .   
Shit , I do n’t think she talked about much .   
I mostly blathered .   
I ’d recommend stuff , she ’d say she would get to it when she was n’t so busy with getting her business started .
”
“ What shows did you talk to her about ?
”
Capricorn asked .
“ Is this so important ?
”
Anelace asked .
“
What shows ?
”
Capricorn asked , more firmly .
The competitive streak might have been coming out .   
He very naturally took the lead in this questioning , when we had invited Foresight to the table .
On a level , I could n’t blame him .   
I had issues with Anelace ’s approach to the interrogation .   
With Capricorn , there seemed to be a thrust to it .   
He had something in mind .
“ TVA , it ’s Earth Aleph stuff .   
I ’d complain because they do n’t always have all the episodes at the station , and it ’s not like we can get more .   
Sometimes I ’d watch a show and it would skip episodes , and it got really confusing with this one modern supernatural show , because it actually skipped an episode on purpose , because of time magic- ”
“ Focus .
”
“
Um .   
Yeah .   
Some trashy television .   
Reality stuff , I tried to pitch it to her
but she seemed repulsed .
”
“
That ’s good .   
That ’s the sort of small detail that might be useful , ” Capricorn said .
Taz nodded , seemingly eager to be giving us anything that might help .   
“
Uh , I ’d bring up sports , when there was a match .   
Parahuman brawling-
she was n’t a fan .
”
“
Repulsed again ?
” I asked .
“
Nah .   
Just not a fan .   
I brought up basketball a lot .   
The high school teams have a league this year , with a lot of the athletic students focusing on sports during their half - days .   
She said she missed watching .
”
“
Which means she had some interest .   
Who did she root for ?
”
Capricorn asked .
“
Oh , huh .   
The Heralds .
”
“ She liked them ?
”
“
She really liked them , ” Durbin said .
“
That ’s not Earth Gimel , ” Anelace said .   
“
That ’d be the school in Wailings
, Earth N. ” “ Lord of Loss ’s territory , ”
I said .
“ You do n’t think he ’s responsible , do you ?
”
Anelace asked .
I shook my head .   
“
No idea .   
But it says something if they ’re maybe coming from a place that ’s not a part of the megalopolis
and they attacked it in the way they did .   
It also explains why they set up shop here .
”
“
They ’re not connected to us , ” Anelace said .   
“ For internet
, information , cell … they had to come here .
”
“
It ’s thin , ” Capricorn said .   
“
It ’s a place to look , though .
”
“ Durbin , ” I said .   
When he did n’t snap his attention to me , I said , “ Taz .
”
“
Yeah ?
”
“
When she paid you .   
What did she give you ?
”
“ Forty a night .   
Twenty if she brought gas .
”
“
No , I mean what type of currency ?
”
“
New Dollars , ” Durbin said .   
“
In my pocket .   
I still have some , it ’s hard to exchange .
”
I remained where I was and let Anelace be the one to fish in Durbin ’s pocket , drawing out the wallet .   
He opened it up and fished out a bill .   
“
Tracking number might help us trace it back .
”
“ Ooh , ” Looksee said .   
“
Wait , hold it flat .
”
She approached the table .   
Anelace held the bill flat , and Looksee took a picture of it .
“ Fingerprints , ” she said .
“ I was n’t happy about it being New Dollars , ” Durbin volunteered .   
“
She was nice about giving me more when the value dropped .
” Anelace nodded , looking at me .   
Unconventional currency for the unconventional settlement of Wailings .   
The Trading Dollar was the dominant currency across the Megalopolis .   
Other currencies were tied to natural resources , to other Earth currencies , but they had their issues .   
The New Dollar had its issues , but it was still used in places , on the fringes .
The hypothesis is getting less thin , now .
There was a knock on the window .   
We ’d asked for a turn at questioning , in exchange for giving them this info .   
It seemed our time was up .
We filed out , and the room that had been a dozen people facing down Durbin became just a room with only a miserable , tired Durbin sitting in his metal chair , elbows on the metal table .
The door shut , and the cop locked it .
Others were already out in the hallway .   
Effervescent stepped out of the room with the one - way window .
“
Effy ?
” Anelace asked .
“
He ’s telling the truth .   
He has a drug habit he has n’t mentioned , but it ’s minor .   
He was scared of her .   
No indication powers screwed with his head or mind .
”
“ If she is a master , it ’s not necessarily that ?
” I asked .   
“
Could it be subtle ?   
You had a hard time getting a read on me .
” ‘ Effy’ looked annoyed at that .   
“
I do n’t think it ’s subtle .   
I do n’t think there are any blocks or scrambles , either .
”
“
It was a very mundane infiltration , then , ” Anelace said .
“ It would be interesting to know if he was being watched , ” I said .   
“
If I were them , I would n’t let something I saw as critical be reliant on one stranger ’s conscience .
”
“
I can check stuff , ” Looksee said .
“
Do n’t overwork , ” I said .
“ I wo n’t .   
This is easy and fun .
”
I glanced at Natalie , who was silent , and then at the oldest cop in the room .
“
This is good to know , ” he said .
“
I know we ’ve been reeling , ” I said .   
“
Stuff ’s … all over the place , with the Wardens gone and key people gone , missing , or being moved around .   
We could have gone this alone , but we decided it ’s key to share information .   
The greatest strength the good guys have is that we work together .
”
“
What do you want ?
” the cop asked .
“
The people who were arrested when we stopped some from getting the portals .   
Interrogation logs , information , anything that could point us in the right direction .   
Whatever we get , we ’ll share with you .   
Whatever you have … give us access .
”
“
I ’ll talk to people , see about cutting away the red tape .
”
“
Same with us ?
” Anelace asked .
“ And the other teams , ” Capricorn said .
“
There ’s really only one other , ” Anelace said .   
“ Advance Guard ’s having trouble bouncing back .   
They got hurt badly by the injuries and loss of infrastructure .
”
“ Maybe a mission will help , ” Capricorn said .
“ Maybe , ” Anelace conceded .
“
Can you ask around , see if anyone has a good enough relationship with Lord of Loss to open communication ?
” Capricorn asked .   
“
Do n’t tip him off , but ask if some heroes could visit Wailings ?
”
“ I ’ll ask , see if anyone knows .   
You should know that a lot of the Hollow Point guys that did n’t get offed fell back to the border territories .
”
“ We ’ll be careful , ” Capricorn said .
A younger officer approached , a stack of print - outs in his arms the size of a phone book .   
Capricorn took half .   
Chris and Sveta each took the remainder .   
Our files .
There was a brief exchange of numbers and cards .   
We shook hands with the cops , and then we shook hands with Anelace .
He held my hand a touch longer than was necessary , looking me in the eyes , and said , “ This was good .
”
“
I ’m glad ,
” I said .
He freed my hand .   
The groups split up , with Durbin left in the care of the police .
“
The G - N portal was one of the data points , ” Looksee said .   
“ Calls made to and from that area .
”
“
There ’s no cell signal from the other side , ” Capricorn said .
“ They come through and make calls as soon as they have signals , ” Looksee said .   
“ Give me a bit of time to get the wheels spinning and I can start on facial recognition , license plates , and start checking on people around there .   
It ’s even close - ish to my place .
”
“ After you get permission from the authorities for that kind of surveillance , you mean , ” Natalie said .
“
Of course , ” Looksee said .
The last time I ’d faced Lord of Loss , we ’d fought Brute to Breaker .   
It had n’t been pretty , but … he ’d played by the rules .
The people he seemed to be hosting in his territory were very much not playing by those rules .   
There was a chance that he knew , which meant another Earth , however small a set of settlements , that was aligned against Gimel .
A chance he did n’t know .   
Which would mean Earth N faced the same kind of subversive attack that we ’d weathered in Gimel .








I flew down and at an angle , to try to break away , and I felt the near - miss , a rush of air that made my hood flap and my hair fly out in disarray .
That rush was cause for me to change direction .   
Evasive maneuvers .
Driving required an expanded awareness of the world .   
It was a mode that I presumed could be switched on , and it was a mode that I ’d never really mastered .   
I ’d read that the reason cell phones were so bad for driving was that they pulled the driver out of that mode , into the five by three inch world of the glowing screen .
Flying was another mode - shift , especially when it came to aerial encounters .   
To be aware of the above , the below , left , right , forward , back .   
Flying typically saw a person flying with their body parallel to the ground , because the ground was worth paying attention to , and because the shape of a human body meant either the ground or sky were faced .   
To fly facing forward with the body upright meant flying against the air resistance .
I was too slow to flip over and look up .   
I felt contact on my back , pressing against the bag I wore .   
My breastplate was in two pieces in the bag , and I felt one piece slide against the other , catching me in one shoulderblade .
Then the pressure , the steady push downward .   
If I were a plane , it would have been forcing me into a nosedive .
I flipped around , grabbed Crystal ’s ankle , and used the rotation of my body with a yank of my arm to fling her off .   
She created a forcefield to ‘ land’ on , her back , hands and feet pressing against it , then launched herself at me , breaking the field in the process of the launch .
Experience told me that she ’d go for something she could grab , and I hauled my knees in toward my chest to pull my ankles out of the way of her grip .   
She passed close behind me , while I somersaulted once in the air .
The weight of my bag meant I had to be careful about getting back to a proper flying posture .
“
You ’re playing rough today , ” I called out .
“ I ’ve always had to play rough to make a dent , ” she said .   
“
Did that change somehow ?
”
“
Somehow , ” I said .   
“ Catch my bag ?
”
She held out her hands .   
I let my bag slide down my arm and caught the strap , then slung it at her .   
She caught it .
“
Oof .   
That ’s heavy .   
Somehow ?   
Bullet in the arm somehow ?
” I tried to use my fingers to get my hair sorted out , but it was caught in clothing and tangled around my costume top , hood , and neck .
No , Crystal , not bullet in the arm somehow .
“
Yeah , ” was all I said .   
I flipped upside down , using gravity to help get my hair to a better position , leaving me to just pluck at it where it had looped around things and let it fall ‘ up’ .
“ Remember when my mom would make us do the flying in formation thing ?   
You , me , Eric , sometimes her ?
”
“
Oh yeah ,
” I said .   
“
I ’m pretty sure that was my mom
’s idea .
”
“
Really ?   
Damn it , Aunt Carol .
”
“ It made flying so boring , ” I said .   
“ Maintain course , fly in parallel , people on the ground might be taking pictures .
”
“ We had to match speed to Eric , and he was the slowest .   
Flying can be so boring even when you do n’t have to do that stuff .
”
I did n’t feel that way at all .   
I ’d had issues with flying before , when a panicky feeling would start to set in and the nearest real thing was four hundred feet below me , but flying was totally amazing .
I flipped back around the other way , my hand up at my hair to help guide it .   
Crystal was flying in a lazy circle around me while I floated in place .   
“
Having to fly to match Eric was worse for you than it was for me .
”
“
Little brothers are a pain , ” she said .   
She smiled , but it was a little melancholy .
“ I meant because you ’re fast .
”
“
But you can do that , see ?   
You just did this thing , you can turn upside - down and right - side up without getting dizzy .
”
“ I get dizzy .
”
“
But you can do that , ” she said .   
“ I have to be careful about any serious flipping , or I ’ll be green around the gills for five minutes .
”
“ I ’ll remember that for next time , ” I teased .
“
Ha ha .   
Do n’t , or I ’ll hurl and I ’ll ruin someone
’s day down there on the ground .
”
“ Over water then .
”
“ Or never .
”
“ Never ?   
Come on , you stepped on me .
”
“ Surfed !
I used you as a surfboard .
”
“
Yeah , that ’s so much better .
”
“
It kind of is .   
Besides , no dirt on these feet .
”
I fixed my hair and adjusted my outfit .   
It was my costume , minus the metal bits , which wound up being somewhat dark , but the white trim , my belt , and the bag helped to break it up .
I reached for my bag , and she handed it over .
“
Thank you .
”
“
You mentioned you did n’t have long before we had to go in separate directions , ” Crystal said .
I pulled out my phone .   
The map was the first thing that came up .
“
I overshot , ” I said .   
“ I have to fly back the way we came .
”
“
I ’m
sorry
I ca n’t help with the move .
”
I shook my head .   
“ Duties .   
I get it .   
I do n’t have much anyway , and I can call dad .
”
“
It might be a little while before we cross paths .   
Stuff ’s going on .
”
“ I know .
”
“ I wish I could tell you more .
”
“ I know .
”
“ If you changed your mind and wanted to stay , you ’d have my place all to yourself .
”
“
It ’s your place , ” I said .   
“
It ’s you .   
I need a place for me .   
I need to do something for me .
”
“
That sounds good , ” she said .
“
Though it is technically someone else
’s place .
”
“ Take care of yourself until I get back , ” she said .   
She flew a quarter - circle around me , as if flitting around and fretting were the same thing .   
“ I worry .
”
“ I worry about you , ” I said .   
“
This classified mission to places unmentioned .
”
“
It ’s not classified ,
I ’m
just … not supposed to talk about it .   
Because of orders .
”
“ It ’s classified .
”
“
They have n’t used that word .
”
“ Be safe , ” I said .
“ I ’ll try .
”
She gave me a hug , coming in from the side so as not to jostle or bump the sling .
We parted , and I flew backward , watching as she flew away , until she was just a speck in the distance .
I put my phone away .   
Now that I was n’t being bullied mid - flight by my big cousin , I was free to keep an eye on where I was going .   
The portal slashing through Norfair was one thing –
I termed it a ‘ slash’ because it was thinner than some of the others .   
There were more clouds in the sky on the far side .   
I flew over it , giving it a wide berth to be safe .
Past the portal , the endless sea of city was harder to navigate .   
I looked for landmarks .   
The financial buildings with the shopping center we ’d been in yesterday was a new one for me .   
Kenzie ’s area was a bit to the north of it .   
Norwalk .
I kept an eye out for and found the Norfair community center .   
I knew the location , and the yellow tarps that were still around the damaged portions of the building were very visible from the air , especially given its relative proximity to the water .   
It had been one thing
I ’d kept an eye on on my prior flights across the Megalopolis .
The Norfair community center was the middle ground between Norwalk and Fairfield .   
Play structures of painted wood and bars were a good clue I was in the right place .   
The building from above resembled what I ’d seen with a check online .
I landed a few blocks away and walked the rest of the way .
Kids were out and playing , many wearing hooded sweatshirts or jackets .   
A handful of adults were out , spread out to see more of the play area .
I approached the fence .   
Kids saw me , and an adult took notice .   
An older woman , with gray hair and clothes of the super comfortable , easy sort that fit a barely mobile ninety year old , rather than what I presumed was a seventy year old .
“
Can I help you ?
” she asked .
“
I ’m here about Chris Elman .
”
She pointed , “ Talk to her .   
She knows him .
”
I walked along the fence until I reached a woman who was handling some of the five to eleven year olds at the edge of the sandbox .   
They looked like a pretty vicious bunch .
She was of Middle - eastern descent , with makeup I might have deemed ‘ evening’ makeup for going to a club if I ’d worn it – very distinct eyeliner , eyeshadow , and bold lipstick that would have stood out in dim lighting .   
She made it work .   
Her clothes were nice- a red dress with a leaf pattern at the hem , on the folded collar with the decorative edge , and her sleeves .
At a glance , she seemed to be the youngest adult in the yard .
“
Yes ?
” she asked .   
However young she was , by the stern tone alone
I could imagine she was the one I would have wanted to cross least if I were ten years younger .
“
I ’m looking for a kid I volunteer with .   
Chris Elman ?
”
Her expression changed .   
She pointed at one of the kids .   
“ Skye , do n’t be a brat .   
Play on your own for a bit .
”
That order given , she approached the chain - link fence .
“ Chris Elman ?
”
“ He lives here , right ?
”
“ You do n’t sound sure .
”
She was roughly my age
and it was the kind of voice that made me think ‘ mama bear’ .
“
He ’s … kind of the kind of kid who does n’t leave you feeling very sure about anything , ” I said .
She paused , then smiled .   
“
Yes .   
He is .
”
“ I tried to call him , but there was n’t a response .   
I know some of the cell towers have been down , so I thought I ’d check in .
”
“ We ’ve had outages .   
Not as bad as some areas .   
That could be it , but you could have waited and tried again , instead of coming from … ?
”
“ Bridgeport , for now .   
I kind of wanted to-
” I hesitated .   
“ -make
sure everything was okay .
”
“
It ’s hard to say anything that would n’t be construed as a breach of his trust , ” she said .   
“
I ’m one of the few adults he seems to be willing to tolerate .
” Maybe because you ’re pretty , I thought .   
Then I thought again .   
Chris seemed like the type to prefer a hard - nosed adult he could predict and rely on over the friendly sort .   
Maybe it was both .   
“
It ’s a sensitive boundary , apparently .   
I do n’t want either of us to cross it .   
Also , behind you .
”
One of the girls was holding a boy down and spitting repeatedly in his face .   
Both kids seemed to be seven or so .
“ Skye !
”
the woman barked the word , and the kids froze , eyes going wide , with only the culprit ignoring the order , continuing to spit .   
She strode over , hauled the little girl off , and pulled her away by one arm .   
The little girl fought as well as she was able , not giving an inch .
All fight .   
This stern teacher did n’t slow her down or make her hesitate a second .   
The yard monitor wrapped the child
’s
own arms around the child ’s stomach , forming an ‘ x’ , like a straightjacket without the jacket , and knelt , hugging her to secure her in that position .   
The kid kicked and threw her weight around .
I had instincts that made me want to hop over the fence and help .   
Still , outing myself as a cape at Chris’ home would do more harm than any good I could do here .
“
Sorry , ” the woman said .
“
Not a problem , ” I said .
Skye shrieked .
The little girl gradually stopped kicking , as she did n’t get much of a response .   
I waited .
“ I can send somebody to get Chris , if you like .   
He should be in his room , if he did n’t go for a walk .
”
“ Chris ?
” Skye asked .
“
Yes , ” the woman said .   
“
Why do n’t you go , Skye ?   
You ’ll burn off some energy if you run .
”
Skye looked between us .   
“ I do n’t want to .
”
“
Well , you have to , now .   
Spitting is n’t allowed , this can be your time out .   
You know where his room is ?
”
“ Everyone knows , ” the girl said .   
She was still breathing hard from the struggle .
“
Great .   
Katie ?   
Go with Skye .   
Hold her hand tight .   
Tell Chris his friend is here .
”
One of the older girls approached , an eleven - year old .   
Skye was released from the hold , and , after hesitating , took Katie ’s hand .
“ Scoot !
”
the yard monitor said , and she might as well have cracked a whip , because the kids picked up the pace .
I watched them go into the building .   
The yard monitor wiped away most of the dirt that the kneeling and kicking had deposited onto her knees and upper shins .
“
They ’ll be a minute .   
He ’s on the top floor
and he ’s probably in bed .
”
“
Got it , ” I said .   
“
I ’m
Victoria , by the way .
”
“
Val .   
We can talk until he arrives .
”
“
Sure , ” I said .   
I frowned slightly as I tried to think of how to phrase it .
“ Worries , questions , or warnings ?
” she asked .
“
Well , it ’s telling that the kids are scared of him , and of the three possible topics you just mentioned , worries were one and warnings were another .
”
Val smiled .   
“
He ’s unique .
”
“
That’s-
yeah .   
He ’s okay ?   
He ’s managing ?
”
“
I only know what I see when he ’s here , and he ’s mostly here to sleep .   
He spends some of his time , ahem , volunteering , ” Val said .   
Her sharply penciled eyebrow went up .
So she knew about the cape stuff .
I nodded .
“ A lot of time is spent on ‘ walks’ , ” she added .
“
You ’ve brought that up twice .   
The walks .
”
“
We talk about it , among the staff .   
It ’s been more of an issue lately , and it ’s on my mind .   
We would call his therapist , but- ”
I saw her expression change .
I shook my head .
She nodded .   
The fence bent slightly with her weight as she leaned back against it , her back to me while she watched the children .
“
I liked her , ” Val said .
“ She was terrific .   
I ’m kind of holding out hope , but it ’s a horrible mess either way , ” I replied .   
My voice was a bit hollow as I tried to keep from letting any emotion into it .   
“
I dunno .   
Why is it a big deal ?
”
“ He turned up last night at two - thirty in the morning .   
That was the latest he ’s ever come in .   
We took away privileges , but if we take away one thing he finds other things to do .   
We ’re divided on whether to be stricter about curfew or to let him be .   
I ’m one of the only people who gets along with him in some form , which means they keep asking me for my input .   
I never know what to say .
”
“
That ’s a tough spot to be in .
”
“
Was he volunteering ?
”
“ I do n’t want to say anything he would n’t want me to say , ” I said .
“
Okay .   
Fair .   
I did n’t get the impression he was volunteering .   
Should we stop the walks ?   
Let me know if you ’re not comfortable saying .
”
I wondered if he was going out to change .   
“
Given his situation , he might need it .   
It ’s hard to say-
it would depend on how he ’s doing here .
”
Her head turned , and she looked at me with one eye .   
“
How do you think he ’s doing ?
”
“ The kids are scared of him , apparently .
”
“
He ’s odd .   
He celebrates being odd .
”
It seemed like a tepid response , a half - answer .   
“ Is that it ?   
Or is there more ?
”
“ A number of the other teachers and the admin are scared of him , ” she admitted .   
“ I am , sometimes .
”
“
Why ?
”
“
Because when you see him with any regularity , you notice changes day to day .   
He ’s had two roommates , and one asked to be moved to another room .   
The second was made of sterner stuff , but he gave up after sharing a room with Chris over the late winter and spring .
”
“ Chris can be tough to get along with , ” I said .
“
He was scared , ” Val said .   
“
He was n’t and is n’t comfortable being in the same room as Chris .   
He ’s been uneasy even when Chris was n’t present and it has been that way for two months .
”
“
And now he ’s in a room with two beds and no roommate ?
”
“
We ’ve had lengthy debates about that too .   
We decided it was best to leave him be and let him have his room , at least for now .
”
“ Makes sense .
”
We watched the kids playing for a little bit .   
Things were calmer with the spitter on her errand .   
The boy had wiped his face and was now carrying on making a dirt pile like nothing had happened .
“
There was something else .   
We had a theft issue , ” Val said .
“ With Chris ?
”
“ If this was explicitly Chris , I would n’t be comfortable telling you , ” she said .   
“
We had several thefts .   
Chris was cleared of wrongdoing for the biggest one .   
Some of the children said they had seen him out for a walk at the time it happened .   
Chris’ former roommate was one of them .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .   
“
I ’m not
sure I follow , then .   
He was under suspicion ?
”
“
He was the first many of us thought of .   
Some-
” she said , and she paused .   
She met my eyes and continued talking at a lower volume , “ -feel that he is clever enough to get away with it , and they do n’t want to clear him of suspicion so easily .
”
“
A theft of what ?
” I asked .
“
Things from the nurse ’s office .
” I winced .
I was n’t sure how to feel about that , knowing what little I did about Chris .   
If it were anything else , I could feel upset about it , but
if it was stuff he was trying to keep on hand for his own benefit …
Damn it , Chris .
“
Mm hmm , ” Val made a noise , as if my silence had confirmed something .   
“
He leaves you unsure about things .
”
Not unsure in the way she might have been picturing .   
I was pretty sure he was the culprit .   
When it came to blaming him , though … yeah , unsure was a good word .
“
You mentioned that you get along with him , ” I said .
“ As much as anyone does , which is n’t a lot .
”
“ Some others actually get along with him in a normal - ish way , I think , ” I said .   
Rain , specifically .   
Tristan and Byron , in a way .   
Ashley , in a way .   
Kenzie , in a love - hate , reaching kind of way .   
I had n’t known him to connect with Sveta .
“
Do you ?
” she asked .
I hesitated , then said , “ No .
”
“ I wish I could give you advice , ” she said .   
“
I do n’t think I can without betraying his trust .   
There are some things I ’ve picked up on that
I ’ve only ever mentioned to his therapist .
”
“
No need , ”
I said .   
“
I ’m trying to find my footing and figure out where things stand before I push or do anything substantial .   
Not just with Chris .   
This has already been pretty helpful , I think .
”
“ We have three hundred children here , with some in a partial or daycare - like capacity .   
I do n’t see him much , I do n’t want you to get me wrong .   
He ’s only here to sleep , play games or get things .   
Others take up our attention .
”
“
It ’s understandable .   
It sounds like you ’re doing the best you can .   
The roommate thing is a bit of a worry , though .
”
“
Yes .
”
“
And this theft he was cleared of .
”
“
Yes , ” she said .   
“
With three hundred children here , I have seen a number of types .   
Angry children-
”
“ Skye , ” I said .
“
The desperate , the scared , ” she said .   
“
I ca n’t give him a type .   
He ’s uncanny .   
I wish you could solve this riddle for me .
”
Uncanny was a really good word , capturing what I ’d noticed about Chris when I ’d first seen him in Yamada ’s group therapy session .   
Uncanny in every way .
“ I wish I could solve this riddle for me , ” I said .   
“
But when it comes to the volunteer work , he ’s helping .   
He ’s doing good .   
That ’s something , is n’t it ?
”
She gave me a curious look .   
“
Yeah .   
Can I pass that along to the staff ?
”
“
Yeah .
”
The front door of the building slammed .   
Chris stood just beyond the doors , looking for me , finally spotting me .
Oh , he looked pissed .
“ I do n’t know if it helps with the riddle , ” she said .   
“
But out of all the desperate , and all of the scared , I ’ve never had a kid who was so desperate for something , where I could n’t figure out what they really wanted .
”
“ I might have ideas , ” I said .
“
It ’s not the obvious answer .   
It ’s not his health .   
That ’s the weirder thing .
”
I shifted my stance , leaning against the fence , in my best attempt to get a good look at her face .
Chris was stalking toward us , his bag in his hand .   
Other kids stared .
“
I ’ve never had a child to look after who had so many reasons to be scared , who was n’t .
”
“ You do n’t think he ’s scared ?
” I murmured .
“
I used to .   
It was camouflaged desperation I saw .
”
The talk of feelings and emotions and the tie - in to Chris as a cape made me wonder what that form would look like .   
Camouflaged desperation .
Nothing camouflaged at the moment .   
Chris marched his way toward us .   
He had to dodge around two playing kids who got in his way .   
Other kids got out of his way , seemingly by dint of his reputation alone .
“
He really is doing good ?
” she asked .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
In his grouchy , surly way .
”
Chris caught up to us .   
He huffed .   
“
What the hell are you doing here ?
”
“
You did n’t answer your phone .
”
“ My battery died .   
Email is a thing .
”
“ Internet dropped for this area , ” I said .
“ You came without being invited .   
Not fucking okay !
”
“ Language , ” Val said .   
“
Keep it clean with the littles around .
”
“ I hate that word .   
Littles .
”
“
I wo n’t use it if you stop being bad .
”
“
You say that like I ’m a dog
and I crapped in the house .   
‘
Bad’ .   
I ’m trying to explain why this is n’t cool .   
It ’s about respect and boundaries .
”
“
I ’m trying to respect your boundaries , ” I said .
“ You came here .   
From another area entirely .   
Without telling me first .
”
“
No phone , no internet .   
There is , as far as I know , no telegraph or established way of transmitting smoke signals , ” I said .
“ You wanted an excuse to snoop , ” he said , “ Because you can talk about relationship pillars and trust and respect and caring and boning- ”
“ Chris , ” Val said .
“ Or whatever , and you do n’t live up to your own freaking hype , Vic !   
You want me to show respect and you show me none if you freaking surprise me like this .
”
“ Something came up .   
I came to let you know .
”
“
Do n’t lie to me !
” he said .   
If he were any angrier , he might have a vein standing out on his forehead .   
“
You wanted to snoop !   
You quizzed Val !   
You came to my place and you poked your nose in where it does n’t belong !
”
There were times he seemed so adult , and there were times he seemed so young .   
This was the latter .
“
Victoria told me you were doing a good job with volunteering- ” “
Why tell Val anything ! ?
”
Chris asked , voice raised .   
“
It ’s none of your business .
”
“
She also , ” Val said , staying calm , her voice quieter , “ Said your breaking curfew should n’t be a big deal .   
I can tell the other teachers that .
”
“ I do n’t give a shit !   
She should n’t say anything
and you should n’t have brought it up !
”
“ Language , ” Val said .   
“ Break the rules and I ’ll go into your room and take the save cards for your consoles .   
If you really push it I wo n’t give them back .
”
“ I need those .
”
“ I need you to calm down and be a good example for the little ones .
”
I saw as Chris worked to suppress the anger .   
Seemingly only now becoming aware that the other kids existed , he looked around before identifying one .   
“
You .
”
“
That ’s Sam , Chris .   
His room is two doors from yours .
”
“
Whatever .   
How long were they talking before I got here ?
”
“
Um , ” a boy of about twelve gave the answer .   
Sam .   
“
A while ? ”
“ A while , ” Chris said , locking eyes with me .   
“
Yeah , that ’s great .
”
“ Everyone ’s getting together this afternoon , ” I said .   
“ If we waited for the internet to come back or for you to turn your phone on , you might have missed it .   
If you do n’t like it , keep your phone charged .
”
“
Okay .   
I ’m going out , Val , ” Chris said .   
He stormed past her and toward the gates .   
“ Do n’t go in my room .
”
“ You do n’t get to set rules , Chris , ” Val said .
“ Do n’t , ” he said , giving her the evil eye .   
“
I ’ll do my own laundry for now .
”
Then he walked away .   
It seemed like he expected me to have to follow .
“
It was nice talking to you , Victoria , ” Val said .   
“
Maybe we could meet for a friendly coffee sometime .
”
Chis wheeled around , ready to jump right into the fray with more incensed words .
Val put her hands up in mock surrender .
It did n’t necessarily help me , but I could almost see why she ’d done that .   
The push , the pull , letting Chris know she could fight back .
I matched Chris’ pace , which was n’t hard .   
His legs were shorter than mine .
The area was a little spartan , the buildings either the quickly put together sort , of the type that had been most common just after Gold Morning , or the big brick edifices with zero personality .
“
What did you talk about ?
”
“ General things .   
She hinted that she knows about the cape stuff .
”
“
Yeah , all the staff do .   
It ’s a pain .
”
“
She needed help telling what was you being a troublemaker and what was you being a cape .   
I honestly was n’t sure .   
I said I figured it was more the second one .
”
“
It ’s not your job
and it ’s not your place , ” he said .   
“
You do n’t need to check on me .
”
“ I need to check up on everyone , at least a little , ” I said .   
“
I was too slow with Rain and Ashley .   
I worry about you ,
I ’m concerned about Sveta , Byron
’s going through a tough time , and Kenzie-
”
“ You ’re skipping Tristan ?
”
“ I ’m trying not to skip anyone , ” I said .
“ You need to focus on people other than me .   
Figure out your priorities .   
I ’m stable .   
I ’m dealing with my shit myself , I have n’t asked for help , and I ’m doing my share .   
Compare that to Kenzie , the living personification of a cry for help , in so many ways .
”
“
I ’m having dinner with Kenzie ’s family tonight , her place is n’t far from the G - N portal .
” Chris snorted .
“
What ?
”
“
Good luck , ” he said .   
“
Have fun .   
Come back from that and tell me again how I ’m a priority on your watch list .
”
“
That is not what I said , ” I told him .   
“
I ’m trying to keep an eye out for everyone , because that ’s what Jessica would have wanted .
”
“
Yeah , well , what I   want is for people to leave me the fuck be .   
I ’m sticking to the rules-
”
“
Mostly , ” I said .
I could see his expression change , his shoulders rising like steam was building up inside him
and it was all he could do to keep it contained .
“ Chris , ” I said .   
“
I did n’t go beyond the gates .   
Neither she nor I shared anything that you would have wanted kept in confidence .
”
“ I want everything kept in confidence , ” he said .   
Steam still building .
“
It does n’t work that way .   
I ’ve heard from multiple people now that people are scared of you and you ’re bending rules .   
That warrants someone asking a few mild questions to figure out if everything ’s handled .
”
“ You literally make people afraid of you with your power , ” Chris ’s words could only be described as a resentful growl .   
“
Does that warrant someone asking some questions or making sure you ’re handled ?
”
“
That ’s different .
”
“ Or
did your sister handle you when she tightened-
”
I grabbed him by the shoulder , hard , stopping him from walking .
“
-the screws ?
” he finished , locking his eyes to mine .
Cold anger , resentment .   
A twist of something that might have been triumph in his eyes .
“ You do n’t go there , ” I whispered .
“ You do n’t come here !
”
he said , and a fleck of spit left his mouth as he shouted , to land somewhere on my top .   
“
I have to fucking balance everything .   
I lose my heart or I lose my body .   
I ’ve gone to the fucking bathroom in the morning and there was blood and meat in the bowl when I was done , and there ’s two people I can trust to handle the clog or leave me alone
so I can handle it .   
She was one of them .   
You ca n’t fuck with that !
”
“ I did n’t !
”
“ You did !   
You said stuff
and you might have changed her mind about stuff
and I ca n’t know how to balance it if I do n’t know what was said !   
She changes my sheets when there ’s fluids on the bed that are n’t blood , semen , piss or shit
, no questions asked , because Jessica said it ’s under control .   
Now Jessica is n’t here
and you ’re putting ideas in her head
and she might change her mind about things !
”
“
What the hell is going on , Chris , that you ’re dealing with stuff like that ?   
Powers do n’t usually tear you up like that .
”
I saw a flicker of something in his expression , between the outrage and the reckless madness I ’d seen as he talked about fluids and Jessica .
Not his powers ?
“ None of your business !
”
“
Is it not your powers ?
” I asked .   
“
Someone else ’s ?   
Someone did this to you ?
”
“ None of your business and fuck you !
”
“
Have you shared about this with the others ?
”
“
No !   
Of course not !   
Because I do n’t fucking want any fucking people fucking with me !
”
“ Chris , ” I said .   
“
We ca n’t help you if you do n’t share .   
I know power stuff
, I studied it , I saw a lot of it at the Asylum .
”
“
Read my lips , ” he said , panting as he said it .   
Now he had the vein in his forehead .   
“
I.    Do n’t .   
Want .   
Help .   
Not from you .   
I want to be left alone and I ’m willing to do the hero thing because it works for me .   
I ’m fine .
”
I ’m fine , he said .
He stared me down and there was no waver in his eyes , no sign of anything in his face or posture besides repressed outrage .
No fear .
“
Are you fine because you ’re striking that balance , emotionally ?
” I asked .   
“ With the forms ?
”
“ If I want help , ” he said .   
“
If my body starts going screwy and there ’s no way to salvage it , I ’ll go down to the seven - seven building , near where the Wardens headquarters used to be .
”
I shook my head .   
“
What are you talking about ?
”
“
It ’s housing the Wardens used .   
Odds are pretty good
it ’s where your sister ’s living .
”
My heart sank to roughly where my knees were , but the place it had been was n’t left intact .   
It was cold and empty and sick and painful all at once .
My heart did n’t feel like it was beating right , and my breathing was n’t right either .
I let go of his shoulder .
I had n’t wanted to know where she was .
“ I ’ll go to her for help before I go to you .   
I ’d go to Bonesaw , if she was still around .
”
I shook my head , walking away .
He raised his voice .   
“ You want to push me ! ?   
I ’ll push back !
”
I stopped in my tracks .
“
That kind of pushing gets you killed , ” I said .   
“ Or worse .
”
“ Do n’t worry .   
I ’ve got a handle on ‘ worse’ , ” he said .   
“ I have for a while .   
Dying ?   
Meh .
”
The ‘ meh’ was both dismissive and an epithet at the same time .
“
Fine , ” I said .   
“
You want this ?   
Go for it .
”
“
That ’s all I ever asked for .
”
“
But where I draw the line is scaring or hurting others .   
Make nice .   
Do n’t give people a reason to ask questions .
”
“
Yeah , whatev , ” he said .
“ And do n’t give the other members of the team a reason to grieve .   
I do n’t want to see Kenzie or Sveta crying over you .
”
“ I like how you say ‘ other’ .   
I ’m off your grieving list ?
” Chris asked .
“ Keep mentioning my sister and you ’ll get there .
”
He snorted .
Man .   
I could have slapped him .
“
Train station ’s this way , ” he said .
“ Walk fast .   
G - N portal .   
The meeting with Lord of Loss is at two .
”
I left him to hike it .   
I flew .
For his benefit , really .
⊙ I landed where the others had assembled .   
There was a blown - up image of Tempera and two capes I did n’t recognize printed on the wall of the station .
When we ’d passed out the word that the other stations were potentially being targeted , G - N had been one of the stations that had been saved .   
I was heartened to see just who had managed it .
I needed a bit of heartening .
It was good to see the other members of the group happy .   
Sveta was smiling , and Kenzie was bouncing around while talking to Tristan .
“ Chris is on his way .   
He caught the twelve - thirty train , it ’ll be thirty minutes , ” I said .
“ Awesome , ” Tristan said .   
“ Listen , because this just came up , and it ’s a good opportunity- ” “
We were talking back hair , ” Kenzie said .
“
Yeah , ” Tristan said .
“ I think if I liked anyone I could like someone with back hair , ” Kenzie said .
“
No , Kenzie , that ’s not
okay , ” Sveta said .
“
But you said you could be okay with it .
”
“ I said I feel obligated to say I ’d be okay with it because my boyfriend has back forks .   
And back wires .   
He keeps it tidy but it is a place he sometimes has to position loose material .
”
“ I feel obligated because some of my favorite people in the world had back hair , ” Kenzie said .
“
Again , please , not okay , ” Sveta said .
“ Why not ! ?
”
“
Because back hair means older , and that ’s skeevy .
”
“
Did n’t the boy Tristan liked have back hair at fourteen ?   
Fourteen is n’t old .   
Well , it is to me , but that ’s because it’s- ”
“ I did not like Jhett Marion !
” Tristan said .   
“ Please .   
Let me get a word in edgewise .   
I can see where Byron got it wrong , but I liked Tyler Redmond .   
He was a senior , he was tall , he had long hair , and he was good at art .   
He had a lower back tattoo and no back hair .   
I ’m not down for that .
”
“
I ’m not down for that , ” I said .   
“ Wax , shave , deal with it somehow .
”
“
Thank you , ” Tristan said .   
“
I value and appreciate your sanity .
”
“ I ’m not changing my answer , ” Kenzie said .
Kenzie and Tristan bickered .   
Sveta approached me , leaning into my good arm .   
“
You okay ?
”
I shook my head .   
I murmured my answer .
“ Spat with Chris .
”
She nodded .   
No commentary .
“
Can we get some fresh air ?
” I asked .   
“
Wait on the other side of the portal ?   
At least until Chris’ train arrives ?
”
“ I can keep an eye out , ” Kenzie said , holding up her phone .   
“
Oh !   
We need to talk about dinner .   
I hope this does n’t run late and we do n’t get a mob of assassins or zombies coming after us , because my mom ’s making this pasta dish- is pasta
okay ?
”
“ Pasta ’s great , ” I said .   
“ Keeping an eye out is great .   
Just-
” I motioned toward the station and the portal within .
We made our way through .   
There was n’t much traffic , but there was a lot of security .   
Patrol block was out in force , checking our ID twice .   
I had to hand over my bag .   
Kenzie unloaded all of her trinkets and things , which ended up taking a few minutes .
The pressure of the city and of accumulated stresses were weighing on me .   
It was hard to breathe .
When we finally got through , it got easier .   
It was a question of walking down a hallway , past a blurry area , and up a half - flight of stairs , passing through doors .
Earth N.    Fresh air , trees , birds , fields .   
There was n’t much civilization at all , beyond the standard buildings that surrounded portals in foreign worlds .   
Supplies , basic needs , a small hospital , administration .   
Not even a small town .








The arrival of Chris’ train at the G - N portal station had Kenzie running off to go get him .   
The initial wave of trucks and cargo from the train began to flow from the station and out into Earth N.    I ’d seen the process before , but it had been as part of the Patrol block , and I ’d usually had duties , or I ’d been a part of the convoy .
Sveta sat on the hill , while Tristan stood near me .   
There were other people sitting around the slope or hanging around in the shade of the station , but we were mostly clear of eavesdroppers .   
It was a question of waiting for a few people to walk away before speaking .
“ Chris and I had a disagreement , ” I said .   
I watched the trucks go .
“
I was wondering why you looked pissed , ” Tristan said .   
“ I did n’t want to say anything .
”
“
He did n’t like that I showed up unannounced .
”
“
I ’ve run into that , ” Tristan said .   
“
He complains if we turn up unannounced , he complains if we do n’t invite him to stuff like our group ’s visit to the Wardens’ headquarters , when we were asking about hiring a lawyer and sounding people out on Hollow Point .   
I think he likes complaining .
”
It bummed me out a bit that Cedar Point ’s name had n’t survived , with all we ’d done .
“
It was n’t complaining .   
He was pissed , ” I said .   
“
I ’m telling you guys
so you know .   
He might be bothered enough to bring it up .
”
“ How pissed was he ?
” Tristan asked .   
“ Scale of one to ten ?
”
“ Pissed enough to weaponize things I told the group in confidence .   
Seven ?
”
“
Okay , ” Tristan said .   
“
Did you get the rage vibe from him ?   
Do we need to disinvite him from the meeting with Lord of Loss ?
”
“
That’s- no , ” I said .   
“
My first instinct is no , we do n’t , but I do n’t want to go by first instincts only .   
The situation made it hard to tell if it was lingering rage , and … the more I try to find words , the less sure I am about disinviting him .
”
Sveta was quiet , “ It sets a bad precedent .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“ Shutting people out , and I do n’t think he ’d forgive it very easily .   
I could have handled it better , but Chris is n’t the sort of person
I really ‘ get’ .   
I feel like every time I find out something more , I just have more questions .
”
“ I think if you asked him , ” Sveta said .   
“
He ’d say you do n’t need to get him or get answers .   
You should just respect his boundaries and let him do what he wants .
”
“ People in his day to day are scared of him , ” I said .   
“ Teachers , kids .   
I need some answers , just to make sure I ’m not standing around doing nothing while missing something important or dangerous .
”
“
Yeah , ” Sveta said .   
She looked up at me , and said with grave sincerity , “ I totally , one hundred percent get that .
”
“ You ’re thinking about the Irregulars ?
” Tristan asked .
“
Yeah , ” she said .   
“
It gives me the worst feeling , when I look back on things in retrospect .   
So many stupid things we should have paid attention to .   
So many .   
We let a lot of things slide because we were worried about how it would change the tone of things , and because of friendship , or what we thought was friendship .   
I ’d rather see people get upset now than have it all go wrong later .
”
“
Yeah .   
We ’ve talked about that , ” Tristan said .   
Then , like he was remembering I was there , he turned to me .   
“ Both of our teams capsized .   
We ’ve done the whole thing before , where you go out , get drunk , and rant about the past-
”
“
No we did n’t , ” Sveta said .
“
Let me finish .   
We did it without the drinking part , I mean .
”
“
Oh .   
Yeah , ” Sveta said .   
“ I guess .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
A good rant can be healthy .   
Get it out .
”
“ We ’ve done that .   
The drunken bemoaning of existence , without being drunk , ” she said .
“ I was n’t able to talk , ” I said .
“
Still .   
You worked that keyboard .
” I shrugged .
“
I ’m trying to be balanced about this , ” she said .   
“
I made this mistake once , and I do n’t want to be blind , but I feel like pushing too hard or prying might make things break down , and that does n’t make it better .   
I ’m not going to say you ’re doing it wrong , Victoria .
”
“
I do n’t know
if I ’m doing it right
. ”
“
Yeah .   
But … you do what feels right , because I do n’t know
if I ’m doing it right either .   
I want to help people stay together .   
That means protecting each other , being supportive , that ’s my priority .   
We have to know each other
, that ’s part of it , and it ’s the part where I do n’t necessarily sympathize with Chris .
”
“ I do n’t want to repeat my error from earlier and pry , ” I said , checking to see if Kenzie and Chris were coming .   
“
But … has he talked about his background ?   
His deal ?
”
“
No , ” Tristan said , at the same time Sveta shook her head .
“
Some , ” Sveta said , “ But hypotheticals .   
He ’s real about the stuff like the center he ’s living at now , and his health issues , his power , but even that ’s
…
”
“
Yeah , ” Tristan said .
“
He does n’t leave you very sure about it , ” I said .
Sveta nodded .   
“
I ’m not going to pry or dig , but I am going to pay attention .   
Not just talking about Chris , for the record .
”
“
I ’m not good at that ,
” Tristan said .   
“
I hear you two .   
I get it
, we made a mistake with Ashley .   
That hard conversation with Rain took far too long , he left , and he did n’t really reconnect until the whole thing with the Fallen camp ended … and he went straight from there to jail , pretty much .   
Ashley
… I felt like utter shit , sitting there in the pre - court thing , knowing we put her in that position .
”
“
Yeah , ” Sveta said .   
“
Definitely .   
Especially when I helped set her up to do it and then made her turn herself in , too .
”
“
She turned herself in herself , ” I said .   
“
She went to the patrol block .
” Sveta shrugged .
“ I get it , ” Tristan said , repeating himself .   
“ We have to watch out that it does n’t happen again-
that ’s why you ’re talking about this stuff ,
right , Victoria ?
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
A part of it .   
I think it ’s what Jessica wanted from me .
”
“
So I ’m not good at that ,
” Tristan said , repeating himself .   
His fist smacked down into the flat of his palm .   
“ I want to chase the parts where we click as a team .   
We had a few of those good moments .   
If we have more , that could be where the walls come down , or where the team members who do n’t click .
”
“
You ’re reminding me of Kenzie ’s seating chart , ” Sveta said .
“ Seating ?
” I asked .
“ Figuring out the group relationships , ” Sveta said , smiling .   
“
It started out normal , having to do with who sat where in the group therapy session , but she kept working on it .
”
“ It looked like a tinker blueprint at one point .   
Mrs. Yamada ended up banning the chart and the topic of the chart from the room , ” Tristan said .   
“ If you ever need to distract her from something , you can mention the chart .   
She ’ll talk about it until someone stops her .
”
“
She ’s not a dog you distract with a toy , ” I said .
“ No , but- ” Tristan said .   
His head turned .   
“ Ey !   
Taking your time !
”
Chris and Kenzie were approaching , as part of a loose crowd of sixty or so people .   
Most of those people wore work clothes .
“ We had to wait for trucks and stuff to unload , ” Kenzie said .   
She wore a navy gingham dress with a folded white collar , and a heart hairpin
I ’d seen before .
“
If you wanted me to show up sooner , you should have sent your messenger sooner , ” Chris said .   
“
You were talking about me ?
”
“ I mentioned we ’d argued , ” I said .   
“
That led to talks about group dynamics .
”
“
What ? ”
Kenzie asked .   
“ Argue ?
”
“
Did you mention that you threatened to kill me , or do worse ?
” Chris asked .
“
What ? ”
Kenzie asked .
“
No , ” I said .   
“
Because I did n’t .   
I said the kind of thing you were talking about-
” I stopped myself .
“ Go on , ” he said .
“
Can I bring this up here ?   
Do you want to rehash this with these guys here , or do you want to let this be ?
”
“ Go on .   
I really want to hear how you justify it , ” he said .
“ Going to Bonesaw for help before you went to me , out of spite ?   
That ’s the kind of thing that gets you killed or worse .
”
He stared at me .
“
I ca n’t remember how I worded it , but that was not what I meant .   
I ’m sorry , if it came across that way .   
I ’ve hurt people badly enough to risk killing them , like Valefor , but I do n’t set out to kill .   
I-
I definitely do n’t set out to do worse than kill people .   
That ’s not me .
”
He continued to stare , until Kenzie elbowed him .
“
Do n’t do that , ” he told her .
“
Say something to her .
”
“
I ’m not cool with you showing up .
”
“ Chrisss , ” Kenzie said .
He glared at me .   
She elbowed him again .
“
Stop , Kenz .   
And I believe you , ” he told me .   
“
I buy it .   
That in no way is me being okay with you showing up .   
I ’m still ticked .
”
“
That ’s fine , ” I said .
“
You and I can talk about it after , ” Tristan said .   
“
You ’ve had a few times where you were incommunicado .   
We had to do something .
”
“ I could do a phone thing , ” Kenzie said .
“
You ’re doing too many things , ” I told Kenzie .
“
It ’s important that we can stay in touch , though , ” she said .
“ There ’s got to be a simpler answer or policy than you going the extra mile every time , ” Tristan said .   
“ Chris , your phone is n’t working at all ?   
Was it an outage ?
” Chris shrugged .   
“
It was n’t charged .   
I was stressed , so I went out last night , went to the middle of nowhere , changed to Quiet Awe .   
I put on some music and lounged , tried to shut out the world .   
I spent too long like that , changed back by accident , went straight back to that form .   
Came back at one in the morning ,
probably , power was off , I could n’t charge it .
”
I met Sveta ’s eyes .   
Quiet Awe did n’t sound like a derivation of anger .
“
We ’ll figure something out , ” Tristan said .
“
Alright .   
Are we changing here ?
” Chris asked .
“ We ’ll go down into the town , find a spot , and then change out , ” Tristan said .   
“
We ’ll stand out less , and there wo n’t be as many cameras as there are here at the station .
”
I turned my head to look .   
Kenzie pointed at two .
“
Do n’t point at them , ” Chris admonished her .
“
They ’re so shoddy
it ’s barely worth calling them cameras .   
I ’m
scrambling our faces so they ca n’t track our secret identities .
”
“ We ’ve got two team members without secret identities , ” Chris said , looking at Sveta and I.    “ And Tristan looks so much like a hero out of costume that it does n’t fool anyone .
”
“
No I do n’t , ” Tristan said .
“
You look like Legend
probably did when he was a teen , except light brown with a modern haircut .
”
“ I don’t- ” Tristan started .   
He stopped as the last few passengers of the train and the people who were picking them up emerged .   
As the crowd fanned out , they approached the point they might be in earshot .
“
You know it ’s true , ” Chris said .
“
Whatever .   
Let ’s disappear into this crowd and find a place to change .
”
“ I ’ll try to scramble recording devices pointed our way , ” Kenzie said .
The road down to the settlement proper was a bit sloped , so I gave Sveta my good arm to help her keep her footing .
Earth N was not a very populated Earth .   
This settlement and the surrounding area were more or less it , with a few stations at key points around the globe , harvesting the most accessible resources that lined up with what we knew about from other Earths .
But with roughly one hundred and fifty thousand people settled on this world , ninety percent of them within twenty - five miles of the portal , it did n’t take much clout to control it .   
Lord of Loss and his clique managed that .
Things were n’t as nice as they were in the megalopolis .   
Roofs were often corrugated steel .   
I saw houses with additions that were plywood with plastic tacked to them .   
Others were best described as cabins .   
It marked a stark contrast from a city where vast quantities of materials had apparently been arranged and even brought to key locations before Gold Morning .
The stores were basic , and any design beyond the bare bones had clearly been tacked on after the fact .   
A long lineup outside of a larger building made me think of a soup kitchen or other kind of rationing .
There were two people with visible injuries in the loose crowd that we ’d joined .   
People from the train station .   
They were young , they might have been friends , and one sported a black eye , while the other had a cut on his cheek that extended to his ear .   
The injuries had n’t seen enough attention- left to heal with the weight of the skin pulling the injury open , it would scar into an open line .
Both those two and roughly half of the remainder looked like they were denizens of Earth
N.    Their clothes and hair reflected the same standards and ideas that the buildings did .   
A lot was being done with very little , and that little was already a bit worn around the edges , strained by hard living and a lack of infrastructure .   
I saw clothes which were clearly less than two years old , yet worn .   
I imagined they had been washed with hard scrubbing in water outdoors .
“
Fresh air , ” Kenzie said .   
She drew in a deep breath .   
“
It ’s so nice .
”
“
It ’s not like we do n’t have fresh air in our neighborhoods , ” Chris said .   
“
There ’s barely been an opportunity to screw anything up .
”
“
It ’s still nice .
”
I was n’t sure I agreed .   
I ’d been here before , but it had been in the winter , and I barely recognized the place now .   
I ’d seen other places like it , and it had always felt strained and desperate .
Sveta squeezed my arm .   
I looked past her to Tristan , and I saw that he was indicating a route .   
Off the road , into the midst of houses and high fences .
We found a spot where the fences met in a broad ‘ v’ shape , not really in full view of anyone standing at the main road looking down our way .   
Tristan and I put down our bags .   
Kenzie began unrolling the sleeves of her costume from beneath her dress to her ankles , kicking off the shoes she wore over her costume footies .
“
I ’ll wait , ” Chris said .   
“
I ’ll use this spot when you ’ve vacated .
”
“ I can leave you a cloaking thing , if you ’re worried about dropping trou in public , ” Kenzie said .   
She messed with her phone , and the cloaking dropped away from the bag she wore at her back .   
Her helmet hung from the outside of the bag , her gloves stuffed inside it .
“
Sure , ” Chris said .   
“
So long as you ca n’t watch me through it .
”
“
Stop saying that !   
I would n’t !
”
I put my breastplate on , strapping the two individual halves , which were curved out so I could bend over without it being too rigid .   
The upper twenty - five percent of the armor was already attached to the upper half , needing only to be pressed against my collarbones and the inside of each shoulder .   
The front corner of my hood that might have clipped up beneath my chin hung over most of that band of armor .
The spiked attachments on hood , sleeve , the center - front of the breastplate , and at either side of my boots were last .
I had only one good arm , which meant that I was only about as fast as Tristan putting on his whole set of armor , and I was only doing my armor and decorations over top of the costume - ish outfit .
“
What form are you doing , Chris ?
” Kenzie asked .
“
Strained Peace , ” Chris said .
“
Strained peas ?   
As in baby food ?
” Kenzie asked .
“ You know how blind people can train their minds to emphasize their hearing ?
” Chris asked .   
“
Well , you ’ve done the opposite .   
You ’ve stared so much at your cameras and screens that your ears stopped working .
”
“
Ha ha , ” she said .
“ Made worse by you being a dolt .
” Kenzie smiled .   
“
So harsh .   
Is peace on the awe or happiness line ?
”
“
Happiness , ” Chris said .
“ Why ‘ strained’ ?
” I asked .
Chris shot me a hostile look .
I did n’t press , leaving him be .   
I finished sorting out the straps of my sling and thought about getting a cape that would cover the one arm .
I had n’t ever really loved full capes , though .
“
Strained is a modifier for forms , it goes around the circle with Repressed Anger , Tense Acceptance , Paralyzed Fear , Stifled Disgust , yadda yadda , ” Chris said .   
He took Kenzie ’s cloaking device .   
“ All of which are the bases but with faster reactions and movements in a pinch
, like I ’m made of elastic bands that are all taut , ready to release , or I ’m a gun with a trigger that needs only a light touch to fire .
”
“
That ’s not a good thing , ” Capricorn said .
“
It ’s fine .   
Faster action , lower stamina , lower strength , more durability .   
Changes the abilities that manifest .   
Strained Peace does n’t really have much in the way of special features , so there is n’t a trigger to pull . ”
“
Why choose it then ?
” Sveta asked .   
She ’d attached the last of her stylized additions to her exterior .   
They ’d been painted , much as she had , but it was the same mandala - style effect , where some had n’t been filled it , and the absence looked like a conscious choice .
“
Because we do n’t want a fight and peace works for that , ” he said , and the easygoing tone from before was gone .
“ I need to get it out of the way , it works .   
Trust me when I say it works out .
”
Sveta put up her hands in surrender .
“ We ’ll give you a minute , ” Capricorn said .   
He stuffed everyone
’s bags into the big gym bag .
“ I ’ll hold that , ” Chris said .
“
Sure , ” Tristan said .
Chris held up the tinker device Kenzie had given him , and hit the button .   
The camouflage effect crept over him .
The guy with the black eye from the crowd was hanging out at the front of a store , talking to two others , and he saw us as we emerged from the residential side road .   
He was n’t the only one who seemed to notice , but he was the most blatant about his reaction .   
Instant hostility .   
A glare .
Even the low - level hubbub of the street and the workers on the street changed , conversations dropping in volume , others stopping talking to see why .
“
Wow , ” I said , under my breath .   
I kept my back straight , my apparent confidence up .   
It would not be a good look if we gave the wrong impression and Lord of Loss’ town picked a fight with us before our meeting .
“ I remember times like this with the Irregulars , ” Sveta said .   
“
Especially when we turned up without warning .   
Except you guys are n’t Case Fifty - Threes .
”
“
Bit of a gut punch , ” Capricorn said .
“
Yeah , ” Sveta said .
“
I ’d say we get out of here , but we ca n’t bail on C , ” Capricorn murmured .   
“
I feel like this is going to become something .
”
“ Anyone noticing the injuries ?
” I asked .
The one with the shiner was the most obvious and the closest to us .   
The silence on the main street had drawn a few people outside , and it had brought others from side areas and streets .   
A dozen of them had their wounds .   
Arms and face more than legs .   
Some skinned knees .
Defensive wounds .
Looksee raised her hand , giving the crowd of stone - faced glares a little wave .
“ Easy does it , ” Sveta said .
Looksee dropped her hand .
Then , because the last thing we needed was a monster showing up , Chris materialized , dropping the cloak .
The indulgence form had apparently been derived from the happiness line , as far as I understood things .   
There were similarities .   
The form was tall , but where the other one had been broad in the gut , shaped like a teardrop with a tiny head and thick elephantine limbs , this one was … shrouded .   
What I thought was a shawl at first was loose skin with no pigment , draped in a fashion that resembled a hooded robe .   
Hair and a whisp of what should have been a beard hung down , long and growing as I watched , the length of hair and the hood hiding his face , even though he loomed a foot or two above the tallest person present .   
The long , narrow limbs and frame within that shroud were gaunt , and stood tense with muscles strained and tendons standing out .   
By the way the joints came together and the weight of the skin shroud , it was forced into a permanent crouch , hands bent in and back toward the body , head bent and turned toward the ground .
The teardrop shape remained , but it was well hidden .
“ Looks good , ” Looksee said .
It was something .   
But Chris’ ‘ peace’ form had raised the local tensions to a palpable degree .
A long finger with a raw nail bed instead of a fingernail reached down into the dirt of the road , scratching out two words .   
The red nail bed had grit caked in it when the finger came away .
Where to ?
“
We ’re supposed to head east from the camp , ” I said .
“
He said it was a ten minute walk away , past a hill , ” Capricorn said .
‘ Peace’ Chris turned his head slowly , until he looked down on Capricorn .
I could imagine his expression , were he normal .   
The unimpressed glare .   
This form lacked in stamina , he ’d said .
“
What were you going to do ?
”
Capricorn asked .   
“
Not change ?
”
The ‘ peace’ form turned to look in the direction we were supposed to go .
The robe billowed out slightly , puffing .   
The form ’s head seemed to lack a mouth , or even any clear features besides maybe eyes and the waves of brown hair that hung in front , but something in the midst of the shroud had served for the exhalation .
I could have flown , but as I ’d observed a few days ago , flying had a way of disconnecting me from things .   
I floated alongside the group .
“ You saw the injuries ?
”
Capricorn asked , when we were a little ways away , walking along dirt and grass with rocks at irregular intervals .   
Up to a point , trees had been cut down to use for the building of the settlement on this side of the G - N portal .   
Past that point , the woods were dense .   
From the looks of it , we would n’t necessarily get that far out .
“ Defensive , ” I said .
“ Soldiers ?
” he asked .
“ Soldiers would have run off to tell their bosses , ” I said .   
“
Made a phone call , even texted .   
They did n’t .   
They did n’t run , they did n’t care enough to challenge or confront us .
”
“
Are they not locals then ?
” Sveta asked .
“
They ’re local .   
The clothes , ” I said .   
“
They fight , but they ’re not soldiers .
”
“ Lord of Loss might have a situation going on , ” Capricorn said .   
“
It could be tied to our suspicions .   
Another faction in his territory .
”
“ If it is tied to it , he ca n’t not know about it , ” I said .
“
It ’s times like this that I feel really dumb , ” Looksee said .   
“ I do n’t pay much attention to any of that stuff .   
Um .   
But someone did make a call , though .
”
“
What call ?
” Capricorn asked .
“ Uh , from the city to one of the local towers , ” Looksee said .   
She pointed off into the distance , where something I ’d thought was a tree stood out against the sky .   
“
This is unfamiliar ground
so I do n’t know where call went after the tower got it .
”
“ Probably someone calling Lord of Loss to let us know we turned up , ” I said .
“
Or , if the portal attackers are really here , they ’re passing on word , ” Sveta murmured .
“ Looksee , You mentioned the cameras at the station , ” I said .   
“
Did you tap into them ?
”
“ I did , but it was n’t me being sneaky , I swear .   
I was bored , because Mr. Peaceful here was being so slow and we were waiting so long .
“
Chris moved , skin billowing around him as he dropped into a crouch with a jerky snap , then moved forward with another , until his face was a few feet from Looksee
’s .
She barely flinched .   
“
Yeah .   
You were slowwww .
”
He straightened , standing taller than he had been before turning away .
Looksee reached out to pat his leg .
“
The cameras ?
” I asked .
“ I was curious about them because they looked analog and low rez , and I was wondering if they were trying to be clever and hiding something fancier .   
Nope .   
They ’re just crummy cameras that were out of date when I was in diapers .
”
Chris turned her way .
“
Ca n’t talk , huh ?   
Bet
you had a line , ” she said .   
To me , she said , “ Four - eighty - p , black and white , record to tapes in the station that have zero security .   
They write over the old tape after an hour and a half .
”
“
Can you use them ?
” I asked .   
“
Keep an eye out for anyone running for it while our backs are turned ? ”
Looksee nodded .
“
Good , ” I said .
We reached the top of the hill .   
The wind was cool as it blew past us .   
The sky above was blue , the sun shining , but it did n’t penetrate the ambient cold air .   
At most , I just felt cooler when we were in areas of shadow , like the side street and beneath the buildings .
The area was a dozen buildings framing a kind of cul - de - sac , where a lot of people had gathered on the road .   
More uniformity to the materials and construction than we ’d seen in the last spot .   
No road ran from it to elsewhere-
there was only the road to it , as if it was a defined endpoint .
There was a nicer house at the far end .   
I could guess who lived there .
The response to our arrival at Lord of Loss’ site was as cold as the send - off from the portal station had been .   
Every step of the way , things caught my attention .
A lot more injuries .   
More defensive wounds .   
The injured were corralled , kept in groups with capes or intact soldiers in front of , behind , and to either side of each group .   
They kept their eyes down .
We walked down the hill .
Nursery and Lord of Loss were standing at the path leading between the manor and the dirt road .   
Lord of Loss was in his human form , massive .   
There were a lot of people standing to either side of the path we had to travel to reach them , and he was n’t walking forward to meet us halfway .
“ Be careful , ” Sveta murmured .
Capes aplenty .   
I recognized a few .   
Bitter Pill was one .   
No Prancer , and none of the hyperviolent capes
I ’d come to think of as being the red - tagged , like the old capes on the parahuman online site who ’d had the ‘ do not approach’ banners across their profile .
Not that anyone here looked friendly .
Several in dark clothes with loose threads and designs bleached into them , like fishbones and snakes .   
Teenagers , at a guess .   
They stood opposite a couple in white armor with crisp black designs painted on them .   
That armor had n’t seen a fight in recent memory .   
Moons and astrological symbols .
Three men were staring us down .   
They wore simpler costumes with maximized utility between the belts , pouches , and bandoleers they ’d strapped on .   
As I walked past , I realized that they were n’t focused on me , on Chris , or Looksee .
Sveta was between me and Capricorn .   
They were looking at her or him .
Not her , I realized , as I saw past the eye - slit in Capricorn ’s helmet and saw his sharp focus on those same men .   
Sveta did n’t seem to notice them .
Okay .
We walked further .   
We were effectively surrounded , because the people we ’d left behind us were free to come at us from behind , and there were plenty to either side of us .
Lord of Loss raised his hand , indicating for us to stop .   
We stopped , and Chris immediately dropped into a sitting position , hunching over .
A hundred feet still separated us .   
A man stepped out of the crowd to our right , bearded , with parted hair , a hard mask and crisp clothing- a button - up shirt that was rolled up to the elbows , and a vest .   
He walked with his hands clasped behind his back .
“
Any guns ?
” he asked .
“ Flash gun , ” Looksee said .   
“ Nonlethal .
”
“
Would you set it down on the ground ?
” he asked .   
“
It ’s symbolic .
”
She looked at us for confirmation , got a nod from Capricorn , and then drew the gun and set it down on the dirt road .   
A little too fast a draw- in another situation , that kind of recklessness might have provoked a reaction .
“ I ’d like to use my power to search you , ” he said .   
He held up his hand , and a shape manifested in his palm , swelling to take the form of something that looked like an origami onion , the layers folding back and into themselves .   
“
I would sweep it over you and become aware of anything on your persons .
”
“
No effect ?
” Capricorn asked .
“
No , ” the man said .
“
I ’m fine , ” Capricorn said .
“
No objection , ” I said .
“
I ’m pretty much all armor , ” Sveta said .   
“
It contains me .
”
“
That ’s fine .   
Can I look ?
”
She nodded .
“ I ’ve got more stuff , ” Looksee said .   
“
I can put it on the ground .
”
“ Please .
”
She began unloading .   
The heart hairpin , phone , batteries , the eyehook , the projector disc .
“
And you ?
”
the bearded cape asked Chris .
Chris shook his head .
Kenzie put a pair of the little boxes like the ones she ’d used to hack the keypad lock on the ground .
“ I must insist .   
I could do a physical , full body search if you wanted , ” the bearded man said .   
“ You would have to adjust your robe .
”
“
It ’s skin , ” Capricorn said .
“
Ah .   
So it is .
”
Lord of Loss and the parahumans of Earth N were patiently waiting while we were investigated by this man .
Dangerous territory indeed .   
If they took issue with us , we would n’t have a great shot .   
We ’d been promised safety , but promises were thin , and at least a few people here could have grudges against us .
“ I must insist I be allowed to search you .   
I ’m circumspect .   
I ’ll only tell Lord of Loss what he needs to know .   
What I want is for this to go smoothly .
” Chris hesitated .
What the hell were you doing , Chris ?
Chris nodded , giving his assent .   
He stooped down lower , head bent .
The origami onion unfolded into a whirling frame of lines and flat planes .   
Where it passed over Chris’ leg , the leg on dirt , the dirt settled , flatting down , like there was a gravity or space warping effect in play .
Meanwhile , Looksee was putting a pair of pens , a few marble - sized metal spheres , and a glass case with what looked like three memory cards inside it down on the ground .
The man with the beard and parted hair walked behind Chris , the effect sweeping up and down Chris’ back .   
He searched Chris’ midsection .
“ There we are .   
I see the shape of things , now , ”   the man with the parted hair murmured .   
His eyes were alive behind the hard ivory - white mask .   
“
I can extend you a measure of trust , I think .   
Do us a favor and stay still .   
Give us no reason to be concerned .
”
Chris was still for a moment , before nodding slowly .
The man moved from Chris to Looksee .   
The process was faster- a quick up and down .
From Looksee to me .   
I felt my costume rustle against my skin as it swept over me , my hood moved .   
The effect passed .
Then Sveta .   
He made no remark or comment before moving on to Capricorn .
Capricorn barely paid attention to the power that was sweeping over him .   
He was focused wholly on the three men that had been staring at him earlier .   
They ’d moved from their position , approaching Lord of Loss , and were now leaning close , exchanging words at a low volume .   
Nursery had stepped away to give the three and Lord of Loss some measure of privacy .
“
Good .   
Leave your things where they are and remain still , ” the man said .   
“
Do you have a name ?
”
“
Beg pardon ?
”
Capricorn asked .   
He tore his eyes away from the three men and Lord of Loss , all of whom were looking at us .
“
A name .   
So I can announce you .
”
The three men stepped back and walked away , in the direction of the side of the largest house .
“
Oh , um , oh Jesus , ” Capricorn said .   
“
No .   
We ’ve been putting it off for forever , it ’d be easier if you asked us to go pick a fight with Goddess or something .
”
“ We ’re not asking for that , ” the man said .
“ You want our cape names , or group , or-
”
“
All of the above , ” the man with the parted hair said .   
“
It matters .   
This is a place where formality , titles , and roles matter .   
The name you choose is important .
”
“ Can you give us a moment ?
” Capricorn asked .
“ I can , ” the man said .   
He glanced back at Lord of Loss , then over at the crowd .   
No statement to any grand effect , but the point was clear .   
This was a large crowd and it would be poor form to keep them waiting .   
“ I ’ll be waiting .   
Signal me when you ’re ready , and then announce yourselves .
”
“
Talk to me , ” Capricorn said , before the man was even gone .   
“ Fast .
”
“ We have you and Looksee hammered out , ” Sveta said .
“
No , ” Looksee said .   
“
Um .   
I ’ll be Lookout .   
Change me to Lookout , as an inside joke , because of what he said , after the Fallen thing .
”
“
Lookout ?
” Capricorn asked .
Beside Lookout , Chris was clasping his hands together , head tilting high with hair falling across his face , like he was praying .   
He reached out and gave Lookout a pat on the helmet .
“ A bit dark
but I ’m not going to complain with the time constraint , ” Capricorn said .   
“
Lookout .   
Right .   
Me , you .   
Sveta ?
”
Sveta said a single word in Russian .   
“
It was n’t my first choice , but Weld told me if I did n’t choose , someone would choose for me .   
I guess our hands are being forced .   
Tress .   
Because it sounds pretty , at least .   
But call me Sveta when it ’s not official .
” Capricorn turned to Chris .
The word was already on the dirt , scratched out .   
Cryptid .
No surprise .   
It had been the last thing I ’d seen on the whiteboard in the hideout , before we ’d moved everything out .
They looked at me .
“
I ’m breaking every single rule , ” I said .   
“
Because it ’s a name that needs an explanation , and you ’re not supposed to do that .   
There ’s no time to spell it out .
”
“ I do n’t care , ” Capricorn said .   
“
Out with it .
”
“
Antares , ” I said .
“
The heart of the scorpion ?
” he asked .   
When I arched an eyebrow , he said , “ I pay attention to stars , and I looked up some when you mentioned you were thinking in that direction .   
That was n’t on my top twenty .
” I nodded .   
I had reasons and explanations , but we did n’t have the time , as I ’d said .
“
I ’m not about to complain , ” he said .   
“ Team name .
”
“
We talked about Defense Mechanism , ” Lookout said .
“
We said it was too tinkery , ” Sveta said .
“
I ’m not complaining , ”
Lookout said .   
“
But I get it .
”
“
And we ’re not very ‘ defense’ oriented , ” Capricorn said .   
“ Calling us ‘ defense’ when I ’m
the only defender is like going with mechanism when you ’re the only tinker .
”
“
It ’s a little on the nose , by the way , ” I said .
“
Anything else ?
” Capricorn asked .
“ When we were talking about names in that conversation where Defense Mechanism came up , we mentioned one , and it might be too on the nose , but Swansong liked it , ” Lookout said .   
“
She ’s not here right now , but it might be nice if she got a say , and it suits Rain , which would be nice .
”
“
What was it ?
” I asked .
“ Breakthrough .
”
There was a silence .   
Capricorn had his arms folded .   
The others were quiet .
“
At this point , it ’s better than no name , ” Capricorn said .
“
It works with the original focus of cracking the tougher nuts , ” I said .
Sveta nodded .
“
Let ’s do that , ” Capricorn said .   
He drew in a deep breath and sighed , before turning to face Lord of Loss .   
Capricorn gave a nod to the man .
Lord of Loss extended a hand , palm up .   
An invitation .
“ Team Breakthrough .   
Capricorn , Tress , Antares , Lookout , and Cryptid .   
We ’re here to talk about the state of things , and to see about sharing information .
”
Technically , we came to find out about the attack on the portals , but we ca n’t say that outright .
“
Lord of Loss , leader of Earth N , ” the man with the parted hair said .   
“
We welcome you .
”
Lord of Loss’ body language was magnanimous , hands spread .   
He seemed warm , even , for a giant in ragged armor .   
He approached at a walk .   
“
I ’m sorry for the mess .   
Things have been chaotic .   
I recognize the heroine from the community center .   
Antares ?
”
“
Yes .
”
“ We did that to try and get ahead of what we ’re seeing today , serving up a scapegoat .   
We had a riot two days ago , because we were n’t able to get out ahead of things or give the masses another sacrifice .
”
“
It should n’t be about sacrifices , ” I said .
“
It all comes down to blood and bread , ” he said .   
“ With snowfall only fifty or so days from now , we do n’t have the bread .   
Will the community center and its outcome be a problem ?
”
I shook my head .   
“ Not especially .
”
“
Good , ” he said .   
“
What brought you here
, Breakthrough ?
”
“
Can we talk about that alone ?   
Our team and you ?
” Capricorn asked .
“
I do n’t know all of your powers , and I wo n’t call in any of the expensive favors needed to get that information .   
You keep your five .   
I ’ll keep four
I trust .   
Fair ?
”
Capricorn glanced at Sveta , then me .   
He gave Lord of Loss a nod .
Lord of Loss selected his people .   
The others were dismissed with a wave of the hand .
Nursery had an updated costume , I noted .   
It was fitted to her slender frame , a curved golden band at her belly highlighting the slight bump .   
She stayed .
Oddly , it was n’t the professional looking man or woman in the white armor with the sharp designs that were tapped for his retinue here .   
He turned to the group of teenagers with the bleached animal designs .   
One was asked to stay , a boy with fangs bleached into the black fabric of the bandanna that covered his lower face .
The man with the parted hair , too , stayed .   
I thought it might be because he was Lord of Loss’ lieutenant .
He was n’t .   
Lord of Loss turned toward the house behind him , paused , then beckoned .   
Another cape stepped out , walking down the dirt path , and joined us .   
Most of the others in the area were gone by the time he reached us .   
The one with the parted hair stood just behind him , as Nursery and the fang kid stood at either side of Lord of Loss .
Tall , with long brown hair that passed his shoulders , carefully cultivated facial hair , and reading glasses that he looked over most of the time .   
He had a billowing shirt that ninety nine percent of people would n’t be able to pull off , and tight black jeans tucked into boots .   
His fingers had a lot of rings , and another ring hung from a simple leather cord at his neck .








“ Capricorn , Antares , Tress , Cryptid , and Lookout , ” Lord of Loss made the introductions .   
“
This is Nursery , Marquis , Spruce , and Carnassial .
”
“ Or Carn , ” the guy with the toothy bandanna said .   
“ Not Carnie .
”
“
Ah , name pronunciations , ” Marquis said .   
“
I admire those that can reinvent themselves .
”
He met my eyes again .   
Capricorn , too , gave me a glance .
What was I supposed to say or do ?   
Was it better to walk away ?   
Could I afford that weakness ?
I hated doubting myself .   
I hated when the questions and anxiety seeped in .   
What was supposed to be me moving away from being the overconfident , violent heroine and toward something more measured was twisted by the doubts .   
It took the same dynamic and same decisions but made them into a loss of confidence and strength , in favor of self - compromise and hesitation .
“ Is there a bit of history or something here ?
”
Carn asked .
My head turned , eyes widening .   
How was I supposed to answer that ?   
How did I frame in one answer something I could n’t frame in hours of wrestling with my interpretation of things , alone ?
“
A minor conflict of interest , ” Lord of Loss said , “ It ’s handled .
”
The ‘ handled’ thing was a point I tripped on .
He was n’t talking about Marquis and I.    The focus was on Capricorn and the three men who had walked away .
“ You invited me into your inner circle , ” Carn said .   
“
I get that , I ’m glad .   
I think we ’ve rewarded your trust with good work .
”
“ You have , ” Lord of Loss said .
“ Is there a past history between you and this group ?   
How does that impact the Ferrymen ?
”
“ The only immediate conflict of interest with this team is to do with the community center attack that Nursery and I participated in .   
Antares .   
She and I both feel this is n’t a problem .   
We can do business .
”
I was very aware of the way Marquis was watching me .   
He ’d seen how I ’d reacted when I thought our relationship had come up .   
Damn it .
Capricorn spoke up , “ There is n’t any connection between me and Lord of Loss , aside from us knowing some of the same people .
”
“ Our community of powers is a small world , ” Nursery said .   
“ Incestuous .
”
“ I feel the need to speak up , ” Marquis said .
No .   
You asshole .
“
Another conflict of interest .   
I do n’t think it should change anything , but I also have something of a connection to Antares .
”
“
What kind ?
”
Nursery asked .
“
A family connection , ” Marquis said .
My mouth opened , but the words took a second longer .   
Lord of Loss took the opportunity to talk over my nonexistent words , “ I did n’t know that .
”
I used the words I had n’t been able to find , trying to stay measured when I felt anything but .   
“ I would n’t say family .   
We ’re related , and even that is a forced use of the term .
”
“
Panacea is my daughter .   
She is also your sister .   
The distinction between relations and family is one of weight .   
Good or bad , she has an important place in our hearts .
”
“ Shit , ” I heard Capricorn , barely audible .
“
She ’s my adopted sister , ” I said .   
I was one hundred percent aware of how petty it seemed to seize on ‘ adopted’ , and how I was doing the exact same thing that had left me utterly enraged in the past when others had done it .   
“
I ’m not focusing on the adoption because she was n’t family .   
I ’m trying to make it clear that you and I are n’t that connected .   
There ’s an additional half - step of separation .
”
“
We ’re connected through shared association with one meaningful person .   
I do n’t want to mislead my colleagues .
”
I grit my teeth for a second .   
More and more , it felt like I was having to measure out or calculate my words .   
It was the handling of something volatile in the same way the building of a sensitive bomb might be .   
One mistake , and things would get messy .
Careful , avoid the disaster , keep it simple with your eye on the objective .   
“
No disrespect intended , Marquis , but you were n’t in our lives when she-
”
Do n’t fuck it up now , Victoria , I thought , as emotions got in the way of words .   
Do n’t show weakness , do n’t snap .
“
-and
I grew up together .   
I have n’t been a part of her life since you entered the picture .   
You and I are n’t connected in any … what did you say ?   
Impactful way ?
”
“
Important , ” Marquis said .
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“ I ’ll concede the point .
”
“
Thank you , ” I said .   
I was proud , but not of winning the argument , because it was a petty argument in a way .   
I was proud of getting through it .   
It was the kind of pride I could n’t really explain to anyone , even Sveta .
Maybe Dr. Darnall .
Marquis turned to Lord of Loss .   
“
Her family was the group that put me in the Birdcage for thirteen years , four months .   
No hard feelings- that was the risk I took .   
They took it on themselves to raise my daughter , part of that being my suggestion .   
I do have hard feelings , it ’s to do with how they raised her .   
She was n’t happy .
”
Pride was gone .   
Heavy feelings seeped in and swelled inside me .
“
No , ” I said .   
I wanted this conversation to be done with .   
“
She was n’t .
”
“
But , ” Marquis said .   
“
She sang your praises , Antares , as much as she was able to speak of any of it .   
She loved you and she felt loved .
”
“ I do n’t … disagree , ”
I said , my voice tight , “ But is this relevant ?
”
“
It ’s relevant , ” Marquis said it with an assured confidence .   
“
You were or are her family and that mattered .   
I feel I owe you a debt , especially considering the nightmarish way things ended .
”
It was a gut punch to hear that .   
There was no armor or means of really defending against it .   
I could n’t come up with words , and as I stood there , taking that in , I thought I might fly away .
Sveta touched my arm , and I hesitated in flying .   
Through that moment of hesitation , the flying became harder to do because I could n’t explain why I was leaving now , instead of a moment ago .
The team was hearing this .
I stayed put , brought my arm up to the arm in the sling to a position where I was effectively folding my arms , and nodded .
“
I mention this , ” Marquis said , and he was facing Lord of Loss as he said it , “ Because I am biased .   
I might not have a vote or anything resembling one in this arrangement of convenience we have , but I would consider it a favor if we could extend every courtesy to Antares and her team .
”
“
Your soft favors are more effective than the hard promises and oaths , Marquis , ” Lord of Loss said .
“ I have no idea what you mean , ” Marquis said .   
“
I always keep my promises and oaths .
”
“
It ’s when there are unclear words and rules that are open to interpretation that you ’re most comfortable and most dangerous , ” Lord of Loss said .   
“
We do n’t know Breakthrough or what they want .   
You want to ask for this kind of favor now ?
”
Marquis offered a half - smile , the point of mustache at one corner of his mouth rising .   
“
Yes .
”
“ Annoyingly open ended , ” Lord of Loss said .   
“
Fine .   
Talk to me ,
Breakthrough .
”
Capricorn glanced at me , then asked , “
How well do you know the people in your territory ?
”
“
It depends on who and where , ” Lord of Loss said .
“ Is every cape or criminal here working for you ?
” Tristan asked .
“
No , ” Lord of Loss said .   
“
Why ?
”
“
We heard you controlled
Earth N.    It ’s common knowledge .
”
“ I do control it .   
We have three medium - sized towns and several small areas we ’re occupying .   
I know the people there .   
These satellite areas are focused on a combination of farming , fishing , foraging , and lumber , with strictly temporary accommodation .   
When the seasons are inappropriate for the work being done , or the resource industries falter because there are greener pastures elsewhere , we rent out the cabins .
”
“ To capes and criminals ?
” Capricorn asked .
“
It would be a very brave and adventurous person who used the money they could spend on an apartment in Norwalk or Fairfield to rent a small cabin here instead .   
We ’re a whole other world away , and the retreats put the people staying there a good distance from conveniences and necessities .
”
“ People come here to hide , ” Capricorn said .   
“
You facilitate that .
”
“ Some people want their privacy .   
In the late fall , winter , and early spring , these cabins serve no purpose and offer little connection to society .   
We tapped a market that wanted that isolation .
”
“
Stuff like tinkers building things ?
”
Lookout asked .
“
Perhaps .   
Are you here about errant tinkers ?
”
Lord of Loss asked .
“
We ’re here because people may be using Earth N as a staging ground for their activities , ” Capricorn said .
“
That would be the nature of the arrangement , ” Lord of Loss said .   
“
We keep an eye out for anything that would bring too much trouble down on Earth
N.    We intervene in cases of serious weapons , intent to do harm to members of Earth N , kidnap victims being taken to one of the retreats for holding .
”
“ What about intent to do harm to anyone outside of Earth N ?
” I asked .   
“
Would you catch that ?
”
“ We have powers available to us that could see that kind of intent , if in the right time and place .
”
“ What about other times and places ?
”
Capricorn asked .   
“
How much of an eye are you keeping on them ?
”
“
Very little , ” Lord of Loss said .   
“
I ’m going to be honest , as part of Marquis’ open - ended request .   
We have other things we do .   
The retreats ?    
They are n’t valuable , it ’s not worth excessive time , it ’s not worth excessive manpower , and being too careful would ruin the point of those retreats .
”
“
The fact that a hero team is knocking on our door and asking about things suggests it might be important , ” Marquis said .
He looked so much like her .   
The eyes , the hair , the mouth .   
The shoulders .
“
True , ” Lord of Loss admitted .   
He seated his large armored form on the ground , one hand behind him to prop himself up .   
“
It ’s not an everyday thing .
”
Sveta , Capricorn , Lookout
and I exchanged looks .   
Cryptid was being very still and tense , his clothes occasionally moving a fraction when the wind blew strong .
I thought of the sports team .   
Was the woman ’s inability to work because she was busy or was it something else ?   
“
These retreats , they have internet ?   
Is there cell service ?
”
“
It ’s out more often than not .   
It ’s easier to travel into the Norfair span and use facilities there than it is to rely on what the cabins offer .   
The service is up for one or two hours a day , and it ’s restricted at those times .
”
“
It was better , but that was before , ” Nursery said .   
“
The attacks have been knocking out services .   
The city has had outages .
”
“ Amen , ” Lookout said .
Cryptid nodded .
“ You said attacks ?
” I asked .
“
These are n’t accidents or poorly laid groundwork breaking down ?
”
Sveta added , “ Some people were suggesting the outages were malicious , but the people in charge have been quiet .   
If there are any arrests , they are n’t telling anyone about them .
”
“
It ’s very malicious , ” Nursery said .   
“
Enemies of Gimel know they ca n’t pick a fight .   
Our population is small , but the number of capes scares them off .   
They know where Gimel is vulnerable .
”
I had some idea , too .   
I ’d thought about how much damage the outages , communication loss and disruption of both work and supply had done , especially with the timing .
The colder months were coming .   
We were already in a bad spot , but if infrastructure was stressed or disabled … the costs and loss of labor would have an immense impact .
“
This is the war .   
We ’re being attacked , ” I said .
“ Undermined , ” Nursery said .
They were going after the weak points , hitting them again and again , so the cracks would fan out .   
Something would give .
“
Can you give us the details on these attacks so we can confirm that ourselves ?
”
Capricorn asked .   
“
There might be a lead we can chase .
”
“ Possibly , but not now , ” Nursery said .   
“ I have to talk to people before I share our sources , and some do n’t like your team very much .   
It may take convincing .
” Capricorn nodded .
Nursery had been tied into Prancer ’s group by some fashion .   
There would be some upset people .
“ Are these the same people we ’re after ?
” Sveta asked me .   
“
It ’s similar M.O.s .   
They ’re hurting us by attacking the city .
”
“ Maybe , ” I said .   
“
If so , they have an uncanny ability to hide their activities and hit the city where it hurts .
”
“ These people , ” Lord of Loss said .   
“
Am I right in guessing you ’re after the culprits of the portal attacks ?
”
Damn it .   
It was n’t a hard conclusion to draw , but it put us in an awkward spot .
“
Yes , ” Capricorn said .   
“
Yeah , you ’re right .
”
I really hoped Lord of Loss and his trusted people were n’t on the enemy ’s side , or we ’d tipped them off , and they were now covering every base .
Capricorn nodded .   
“
We have reasons to believe you were n’t directly involved .   
One of those reasons is that we have pictures with their faces .
”
“
You ’ll recognize one , ” I said .
He held out his hand in
Lookout ’s direction .   
She gave him a phone , the screen glowing .
Capricorn found what he was looking for .   
“
These are the ones we have so far .
”
The others approached Marquis , who took the phone and held it in a position where most of the others could see it .   
I hung back a bit .
It was unnerving .   
I did n’t trust myself like this .
“
That looks like Kingdom Come , ” Nursery observed .   
“
That ’s the one
I ’m meant to recognize ?
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
That was my thought .   
You ’ve worked with him .   
Can you point us in his general direction ?
”
“
No .   
He did n’t share much .   
Not location , not what he ’s doing now that the community center is done .   
I saw him four times at one place where villains meet , and he turned down five jobs in that span of time .   
He ’s picky about picking jobs that do n’t weigh on his sense of morality .
”
One thing that I ’d picked up from familial osmosis was that routines were a trap .   
If Kingdom Come spent long periods of time in a place like a drinking establishment , and if he always attended the same church on set dates , then that was something we could use to track him down .
Knowing his routine was a win .   
I wished we had more .
“
You have no idea where he lived ?
” I asked .
“
No .   
I had the impression it was outside of Gimel , but not Earth N.    He attended church daily .
”
“ He was n’t Fallen ?
”
Capricorn asked .
She shook her head .   
“ I do n’t know .   
He did n’t give me that impression .   
No tattoos , no drugs , no vulgarity .   
His faith seemed genuine , and I ’ve known a lot of faithful over the years .   
I think I could tell if he was Fallen .
”
If it was only that easy , I thought .   
Some broadcast what they were , but others , like Scapegoat ?   
It was a surprise .
That made me think .
“
Do you think , ”
I said , “ That he could sympathize with the Fallen ?   
Not being a member , but helping and communicating with them ?
”
“ He likes leading people to good things or the right path .   
He could have done that with the Fallen , thinking they needed saving and shepherding .
”
“
And he would then work with them , share information ?
”
“ I do n’t know , ” Nursery said .   
“
He was decent .
”
“ Aside from taking over crowds and attacking community centers , ” I said .
“
He did it because he thought it was just and right .
”
“
And because of the money , ” Lord of Loss said .   
“
He asked for pay in New Dollars , if that helps .
”
“
Anything else ?
”
Capricorn asked .   
“
Any information about him could help us .
”
Lord of Loss shook his head .   
“
I ’ll pass on anything I think of .   
I can find you online ?
”
“
I ’m easy to find ,
” Capricorn said .   
“ Email or phone .
”
Lord of Loss nodded .   
He reached down for the phone that Marquis held , and then gestured with a finger as long as my forearm , the digit wrapped in the same bands of metal as the rest of him .
“ I ca n’t help but notice the lack of costumes on these images , ” Carn said .   
“
These are civilian identities .
”
“ Composites , ” Lookout said .   
“
Three dimensional models pulled from other places .   
They ’re best - guesses .
”
I was so glad she did n’t elaborate .   
I glanced at Cryptid , and saw his hand move slightly .   
It was as if he ’d read my mind ; he was ready to shut Lookout up if need be .
“
These images are all we have .   
These guys will strike again , ” Capricorn said .   
“
We need to stop that from happening .   
Some bending of the rules against people willing to act on this major a scale makes sense .
”
“ The civilian identities matter .   
You ca n’t go after people in their civilian guises , ” Carn said .
“
No matter what they ’ve done ?
”
Capricorn asked .   
“
That ’s dangerous and ridiculous .   
They tore holes in reality .   
A lot of people died .
”
“
Find another way if you want my help , ” Carn said .   
“
Sorry , Lord of Loss , Marquis , I ca n’t support this .
”
“ Step away , then , ” Lord of Loss said .   
“
Stay in sight .   
No phone calls .
”
“ I ’ve lost your trust so easily ?
”
Carn asked .
“
My trust is n’t the question , ” Lord of Loss said .   
“
Theirs is .   
I trust you enough , but I ca n’t have their mistrust for you or yours for them disturb business .
”
Carn hesitated .   
Narrowed eyes swept over all of us .   
He walked off a distance , to one of the large rocks in a front lawn that served as a roost .   
He sat on it , not facing us .
“
I know this woman with the glasses and black hair , ” Lord of Loss said .   
“
She was popular with several of the people who had cabins in the same area .   
Usually they kept to themselves and wanted their isolation , but she ran poker games twice a week and most attended .
”
“
That ’s a potential list of people who could have ties to her and the greater operation , ” I said .
“ One that exists entirely in my head .   
I wo n’t give you that list .   
I ’ll call and inquire myself , ” Lord of Loss said .
“ That would help , ” Capricorn said .
It helped , but it left me less sure of Lord of Loss and of this stage in things .
“
The investigation has n’t moved forward , has it ?
” Marquis asked .
“ We made some significant progress sharing information just now , ” Capricorn said .
“
I did n’t mean here .   
I meant media , government , and courts , ” Marquis said .   
“
Any progress ?   
Answers from those in power ?
”
I    shook my head .   
“
No news .   
They are n’t naming culprits , which is weird .   
People need that closure .
”
“
Pay attention to that , ” Marquis said .
He said that , and I felt a chill as the sound of his voice echoed with memory .
On the battlefield after Gold Morning .   
Amy .   
My traitorous , mutilated heart had soared on recognizing her .
She ’d veered between cultivated confidence and being distraught .   
I had n’t recognized any of the faces she ’d shown me .   
I did n’t recognize the voices .
Here , I could match
Amy ’s voice from back then .   
I recognized the cadence , and the confidence .
She ’d picked it up from being around Marquis .
I ’d claimed there was no real connection and now it was harder to defend that claim .   
It was a stupid , mindless link between past and present , and I still felt chilled .
I could n’t even remember what he ’d said just now , or the conversation before it .
I was saved from embarrassing myself only by Lord of Loss stating , “ That one arrived last night and has n’t left today .   
They ’ve been here for a little while .
”
He was indicating the phone with the pictures , which Marquis was holding up for him to look down on .
Capricorn took a step forward .   
“
Which ?   
May I approach ?
”
He got a wave of the hand , giving the permission , and approached , finding a position to see between Marquis and Lord of Loss .   
For our benefit , he said , “ The woman with black hair .   
She was a leader for this particular cell .
”
“
She rented one of the retreats , ” Lord of Loss said .   
“
We take note when capes and people with money enter or leave the station .   
She was one .
”
“ That would be my focus , ” Spruce said .   
“ If you have questions , I can answer them .
”
“
You set up and manage the security cameras ?
”
Lookout asked .
“ Among other things .
”
“ I see .   
Hmm , um , ” Lookout said .   
“
It ’s good
you ’re trying .   
I ’ve got your footage , and my computers back home are looking it over .   
It looks like she left yesterday at the usual time , but her bag looks bigger .   
She might have packed up .
”
“
She might not have packed up everything , ” Sveta said .
I imagined my imminent move to Ashley ’s apartment .   
“
Yeah .   
It ’s hard to get everything .   
The other possibility is that she ’s up to something .
”
“ More use of Earth N as a staging ground , ” Capricorn said .
It was an unnecessary dig , but one I could sympathize with .   
In exchange for a small profit , the warlord of Earth N had given some horrendous people even more horrendous elbow room to do their work .
I frowned .   
“ Lord of Loss , do you have any idea what her powers are ?
”
“ Powers ?   
No .   
We paid attention to her because she had money .
”
“ She might have a minor mutation , ” Sveta said .   
“
She always wears sunglasses .   
It ’s a good clue someone has powers , if they ’re covering something up .
”
“
It also applies to the power - affected , ” Marquis said .
Was that a dig ?   
I had no idea , and I hated that I was even asking myself , instead of ignoring it .   
Fuck me .
“
The problem is , whoever or whatever she is , powers we do n’t know are dangerous , ” Sveta said .   
“ We risk tipping them off .   
There ’s a chance she could come back .
”
“ If we ignore it , she might find out we visited through rumors , ” Capricorn said .   
“
That could be enough for her to run for it .   
I say we go now .   
It gives us a chance to be on her heels .
”
“ I agree with Capricorn .   
But only if Lord of Loss is willing to let us step in , ” I said .
“
Good answer , ” Lord of Loss said .   
His tone had changed slightly .   
More serious .
“
It impacts your business , having us there and poking around ” I said .   
“
I understand that , but they attacked all of us , when they did what they did .
”
“ Back at the community center .   
When the gun went off and Miss Fume Hood was shot , I struck a deal with you , ” Lord of Loss said .
“
We let each other go , so I could help her , ” I said .   
“
You asked me to tell people you were n’t responsible .
”
“ Our goal was to capture , hold , and release .   
Killing was n’t the intent .   
You held up your end of the deal , you made that clear .
”
“ I tried my best .   
I did n’t have as much clout as I would have liked , being the person who was hiding her powers .   
I told my boss it was important , and he handled it .
”
“
It was enough , ” he said .   
“ Thank you .   
And in thanks , continuing this trend of cooperation , in exchange for information and images you ’ve shared , and because of Marquis’ goodwill , you can investigate .   
I have trucks .
”
It did n’t take long for us to get moving , after Lookout picked up her stuff .   
Lord of Loss had cars and trucks .   
Capricorn ended up in the driver ’s seat again .   
Marquis had Spruce as a chauffeur .   
Lord of Loss changed into a flier .
I thought about flying myself , but I defaulted once again to sticking with the group .
I took a seat in the back .   
The truck had a trailer attached at the back , and Cryptid seated himself in it .   
The little window at the rear of the truck was left open , so Cryptid ’s head was n’t that far from us .
The first minute or so of driving was painful .   
The silence dragged .
I did n’t know what to say .
No , maybe I did .
“ Marquis gives me the impression he ’s the real person in charge , here , ” I said .   
“ With Lord of Loss as the decoy king .
”
“ I kind of got that vibe too , ” Sveta said .
“
Aw , I keep missing stuff , ” Lookout said .
Capricorn was silent , but he was more focused on driving .
“
It ’s little things you learn to watch out for , ” Sveta said .   
“
This is more of a feeling thing than it is logic .   
We do n’t have any evidence .
”
“
Ah huh , ” Lookout said .
Sveta was sitting in the front seat .
She turned her head around one - hundred and eighty degrees , tilting her body to one side so she could look past the headrest .   
I gave her my most convincing smile .
Her arm released , forearm and hand dropping between the two front seats .   
Tendrils bent , and her hand moved up to the seat beside me , reaching for my hand .
I took it and gave it a bit of a waggle .
Twenty minutes of driving through nowhere , with only a bit of flattened grass where cars had passed over .   
Cryptid reverted back to being Chris , relying on his cloaking and the fact we were facing forward and he was behind us to maintain his modesty .   
Were the roads busier or if Marquis was driving behind us , it might have been more awkward .
“
If you do n’t want to do the thing tonight because you ’re tired or upset or something , it ’s okay ,
” Lookout said .   
“
It ’s not that important .
” I did n’t want to .   
I was exhausted .
“ I ’ll come , ” I said .   
“ Unless something happens in the next hour .   
It ’s important .
”
Marquis’ car slowed down .   
We came to a stop on a hill with the cars leaning at almost a forty - five degree angle .   
It felt like they would roll down the hill with one good push .
Not that I was thinking of petty , stupid violence as a way of releasing pent - up stress .
Marquis .   
He stepped out of his car , Spruce at the other side .   
Marquis was disheveled in a way that looked very calculated , and it was made all the more pointed by Spruce ’s neatness .
The hill had woods on the other side , and the woods served as a barrier to give us a view of the cabin , while not letting anyone in the cabin get a view of us .
No guarantee it was empty .
“
Lookout , can you give us a scan ?
” Capricorn asked .
“
Not really a scan .   
I can do a camera shot aimed at some special kinds of interpretation .
”
“ That works .   
Whatever you got .
”
She rummaged for a bit .   
She had her bag at her back , cloaked , and she had stuff in her belt , with all its little pouches .   
She found what she was looking for , aimed it , and took some pictures , adjusting various dials .
Her phone had the images .   
Capricorn looked at them first , Sveta looking over his shoulder .   
Then he showed Chris and I , starting with the better pictures .   
Dark , with blurs where the grass caught the light , a vaguely human - shaped blur within the building .   
Low to the ground , as if the person was sleeping on the floor .
Another shot , with more darkness , the grass was n’t even visible , with only some faint striations running through it .   
The power line that ran along the forest floor and up to the cabins glowed , and the electronics within .   
There was a computer on the desk .   
There was more on the wall and a great deal hooked up to the door .
Several came out all white .
“
What are these ?
” Sveta asked .
“ Tests .   
Ignore them .   
It ’s the kind of thing I ’m trying to figure out for secret project six - dash - nine , for our teammates .
”
“
Heat and electric resolutions are good , ” I said , looking at the last few images .   
One looked hyper - detailed , many more were fuzzy .   
Another had fog rolling through it , that did n’t exist in reality .
“
Can we get another heat pic , Lookout ?
” Capricorn asked .
“
One second .   
Lots of dials to adjust .
”
I was very conscious of Marquis’ presence nearby .   
It was as bad as seeing Presley on the train had been .   
Someone reminiscent of Amy lurking in the corner of my vision .
He ’d been fair , he ’d been fine .   
He ’d explained my background without asking , but he ’d also offered a favor .   
Did I trust him ?   
No .
Did that list of pluses and minuses account for a net negative , to warrant how much I hated him ?   
Could I explain why I hated him ?
He was , in a way , reminiscent of everything that had gone wrong with Amy .   
Duplicity , villainy , the fact he breached my boundaries simply by being here when I did n’t want him to be , and that he ’d stayed despite the conflict of interest , when the Ferrymen had left .
The others had some sense of what had happened now .   
I ’d shared hints , but I had n’t spelled it out .
I would have to explain the Wretch .
Maybe if I went to Dr. Darnall .
“ Victoria , ” Capricorn called out .   
There was a note of urgency .   
“ Sveta !
”
“
What ? ”
“ Go !   
He ’s dying !
”
“
Door ’s electrified ! ”
Lookout shouted .
I flew .   
Sveta was right behind me , struggling for a lack of good things to grab beyond the field of green .
I offered her my hand .
Just the force of her pulling made my sling wound hurt .   
I could have asked Marquis for help , and yet there was no way I would .
I broke through the electrified door .   
Sveta was right behind me , launching through the gap between myself and the top of the door .
A man , bloody , bearded , with a mullet and glasses .   
He had a tattoo on his arm and I could n’t see it because he was bleeding so much .
There were liters of blood on the ground and he did n’t have many to spare .   
His head moved as I flew over to him , and his eyes were unfocused .
“
My name is Kingdom Come , ” he said .   
“ Help this man and help me .
”
“
What ’s going on ?
” Sveta asked .
“
He ’s controlled , ” I said .   
“
We ’re going to help you ,
okay , Kingdom .   
Stop struggling , you ’re making it worse .
”
“
Ca n’t hear you , ” he said .   
“
Ca n’t really see .   
If I ’d known you were coming , I would n’t have done this .
”
“ Help , ” I said .   
“ Towels , by the bed .
”
There were towels in the corner of the cabin .   
Sveta grabbed them and I began using them to staunch the bleeding .   
It was n’t enough .
“
They left the body like this , punishing me because I was n’t being fast enough .   
I could n’t bear to sit here and feel a body starve to death , ca n’t disconnect my power from victims like this .   
They wo n’t let me .   
I pulled until the wires did enough damage .   
If I ’d just waited twenty minutes …
”
“ Stay strong , ” I said .   
“ Stick this out .
”
“
Ca n’t hear you , ” he said , sounding far away .   
“
I feel like I lose a little piece of me every time one of these bodies gets discarded .
”
The wires were in the way .   
I reached out , activating my forcefield for just a moment , so I could wrench them , tearing them from where they ’d been lashed .   
A floorboard broke to my right .
It was easier when the wires were removed , but there were some that were acting as tourniquets .   
It was hard to know which was which
, so I focused on the ones that were scraping bone .
The others arrived .   
Marquis , Cryptid in camouflaged human form , Lookout and Capricorn .   
No Lord of Loss-
he was too big for the room .
It was Marquis who rushed to the dying man
’s side .   
I felt an anxious stab in my chest as I saw the angle of his head , the way he tied his hair back and secured it with a loop of bone .   
His expression , which looked entirely as serious as the situation warranted , yet seemed lacking in something- in light .
I saw her in it .
His tools were cruder , but they were tools .   
He helped Sveta cut the wires , and then began to work on the open wounds , sealing them in complex bone encasements .
“ They ’re using me , ” the bleeding man said .   
“
They got me .   
I ’m a way of passing messages between dimensions , and a tool , a weapon .
”
Marquis redoubled his efforts .
I looked away , acutely uncomfortable , then stood , because looking away was n’t enough .
I ’d done what I could , and my presence by the man only made it harder to give care .   
I kept an eye out for where I could jump in , grabbed one or two things to hand them over- like the scissors on the desk .
The man went on , and I tried to focus on the words .   
“
The war is a distraction .   
It pulls us away from the city and away from things that matter .   
They ’re after all the groupings of capes .    
The big teams , the places capes rally .   
They want Goddess , and they ’re going to go after her when they ’re strong enough .
”
“
Who are they ?
” I asked .   
“ Is it the same people who attacked the portal ?   
Earth Cheit ?
”
“ Ca n’t hear .
”
“ Cheit !
”
I raised my voice .
“
Not Cheit .   
That’s- distraction .   
Ah .
”
There was a pause
so long I thought the man had died and Kingdom Come had gone .
Cryptid was now giving his assistance on the medical front .   
He seemed to know more than I do when it came to that .
I glanced at the desk .   
Everything was missing , shredded .
I opened drawers , found nothing .
When we left with our victim , I doubted I ’d get to come back and investigate .   
Not tomorrow .   
Stuff would change .   
Lord of Loss or Marquis would do their own investigation , or use someone like Spruce .
Between the cabin wall and the board at the far right of the desk , was a shitton of dust , with some discarded tissues and food particles .
I used the wretch and shoved the desk away from the wall by a foot .   
Nothing hidden in the debris .   
I moved the desk back .
“
Let me know if you need help , ” I said .
“
No need .   
He might just live , ” Marquis said .   
“
We ’ll need to get him to a hospital soon .
”
“
Do you need me to fly him ?
” I asked .
“
Better to have him in a truck with me and one of our doctors beside him , ” Marquis said .   
“ If he springs a leak mid - flight , he ’ll be gone .
”
It was hard to focus on him .   
I was glad he was helping
and I dreaded that he was here .   
He was one step removed from her , and my head was n’t in a rational place .
Books .   
My bookshelf had been my refuge , and this place had some of its own .
Most of the books had been damaged or abused by the the transition from Bet to Gimel to N , presumably .   
They showed age in the same way a heavy smoker might be forty but look sixty .
There were empty shelves on the far left bookshelf , but no dust on the shelf .   
I checked , and I found something similar to what I ’d seen by the desk at the back .   
Dust , garbage … and papers .   
I seized papers .
Some financial things .   
Some medical .
And one that the woman probably would have wanted to bring with her .   
I read the banner at the top of the paper .   
I was discreet in folding it and pocketing it without Marquis noticing , before continuing my search .
“
We ’re here with the truck !
” a man shouted from outside .
I offered my one - handed assistance in helping Marquis , Spruce , Cryptid and Capricorn get the man outside without jostling him too much .   
We got him into the back of the truck , and Marquis’ people piled in .
The chaos of the moment meant chaos in the moments that followed .   
Lord of Loss was sterner than he had been , ordering his own people inside .   
It was blood shed on his territory , and the man that had been captured , controlled as a Kingdom Come proxy and left to die had apparently been a citizen .
For our efforts to save him , we got a thank you and an implied suggestion that we make our way back to the station .
Sveta was using a small brush to get blood out of the joints of her costume .   
Lookout was with Capricorn and Cryptid .
She had n’t been inside the cabin , but she must have been at an angle to see what was going on .   
A lot of blood and a lot of open wounds and ugliness .   
Even with the Fallen camp , we ’d kept her clear of a lot of it .
I put my hand on her shoulder .   
She looked up at me , solemn .
“
You good ?
”
She smiled and nodded .
“
Found this , ” I said .   
I showed her the paper I ’d saved .
She processed it , then realized its meaning .   
I saw her eyes widen .
I handed it to the others in turn .
It was my only prize , really .   
The other things had been receipts , that I ’d left for the others to find .
The name on the banner along the top of the page was the same name as the remote prison for capes that they ’d sent Ashley and Rain to .   
On the sheet itself , it had been patient numbers , a few months out of date .   
Some had been highlighted .








I stepped out of the bathroom at the Gimel - side G - N station , doing my best to manage two bags .   
One bag had my armor , and the other had some of Kenzie ’s stuff .   
It took some hunting to find her .
There were plenty of trees around the station , a side effect of the city being put down as fast as trees and rock could be cleared away .   
To have a very green look , all that needed to be done was to leave a slice of land and root structures intact .   
Kenzie had situated herself at the base of the tree nearest the entrance .   
She had her phone out , held in front of her .
She waved as I approached , her phone still held out .
“
She ’s back , ” she said , to the phone .   
“
We ’re going to catch our train soon , so I might have to lose the phone
or we might drop the connection because the cell networks are bad lately .
”
“ You said the bad networks might be because of enemy action , ” I heard a male voice through the tinny speaker .
“
Yeah , ” she said .   
She patted the grass beside her .   
I set the bags down and sat .
Ashley and Rain were on the other end of the video call .   
Ashley was offscreen , but her hands were onscreen .
“
How are you ?
”
Rain asked me .
“ I ’ve had better days , but we got info .   
This call is secure ?
”
“
Oh yeah ,
” Kenzie said .
“
Our resident , full - time tinker said you ’d be better to explain the paper you found , Victoria , ” Rain said .
“ If it ’s no trouble , ” Kenzie said .
“ I had a look at the paper .   
The prison is a focus .   
From what Kingdom Come said , they ’re paying close attention to places where capes gather in large numbers .   
The prison where you guys are is one focus .   
Goddess is another , maybe because she has a lot of capes in her immediate orbit .   
The other big teams    are another one .
”
“
Not us , because we ’re not big or important , ” Kenzie said .
“ …
Yeah , ” I said .   
“ I would be interested in seeing how that changed or their angle for approaching us , if things reached a different point .
”
“
Feeling ambitious ?   
Is Capricorn rubbing off on you ?
”
Rain asked .   
“
Or-
”
“
Did I ?
”
Ashley ’s voice came across the phone , closer to the microphone on their end .
“ Do n’t say did , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Not like it ’s over with .   
You ’re not gone , you ’re just there .   
You could even help us .
”
“
We ’ll help however we can , ” Rain said .   
There was a pause , and the camera shifted as someone moved .   
It might have been Ashley holding the phone on the far end , or it could have been a movement that jostled the table the phone sat on .   
Rain added a quieter , “ Yeah .   
I think we ’d be glad to help .   
It ’s the boredom that ’s worst , and this sounds good .
”
“ We ’ll get back to you with more information and direction , then , ” I said .   
Kenzie nodded .   
“
You guys are okay ?
”
“
As okay as I could be , ” Rain said .   
“
The talk at the tribunal helped a bit .   
They ’re letting me have some basic tools , Ashley can come , and I get a chance to work on her hands .
”
“
I appreciate it , ” Ashley said .
“ Four of us live in my building , ” Rain said .   
“
We each have exits on a different face of the building , so we do n’t cross paths as much , but walls are thin and people are bored .   
There ’s a lot of talk .
”
“ I have a roommate , ” Ashley said .   
“
You could call her family .   
Having her around helps some , but it also hurts some .
”
“
That ’s family , ” I said .
“
Yup , ” Kenzie said .
“
I suppose so , ” Rain added .
“
If these updates to my hands work at all , I should n’t be so reliant on her , ” Ashley said .   
“ Patience has a way of wearing thin .
”
“
Yours or hers ?
” I asked .
“
Same thing , ” she said .
“
Uh , right , ” Rain said .   
“
Hey , if we ’re helping out , what is it we ’re doing ?
”
“ Watch out for anything suspicious , ” I said .   
“
Anyone who seems to show too much interest in the way things work .
”
“
That could be anyone , ” Rain said .   
“
Us , even .   
It ’s an odd setup , everyone wants to know more as soon as they ’re here .
”
“
Odd how ?
” I asked .
“
That would be us , right now , ” Rain said .   
“
It ’s a town , almost .   
Every building is its own set of cells .   
Wide roads separating things , longer walks between facilities that matter .
”
Ashley added , “ They spread us out so that if one person blows something up or uses a power , they ca n’t affect more than a building or two at a time .   
Eight parahumans at most .
”
“
And they have the countermeasures .   
The ankle attachment , ” I said .
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .   
“
A lot of security is offsite .   
Everything is scheduled , so we do n’t have too many of us in one place at one time .   
Officers have guns , remotes for the bombs we ’re wearing and access to security cameras stationed at irregular intervals with irregular schedules .
”
“ I hear security cameras and my imagination goes wild , ” Kenzie said .
“ Be careful about fooling around , ” Ashley ’s voice was almost that of a parent .   
Warning , guiding .   
“ If you make a mistake , it reflects on us .
”
“
Yeah , ” Kenzie said .   
Her expression was serious .   
“
I do n’t want that .   
I want you out of there already .   
Both of you .
”
“ It will take time .   
You can call in the meantime , ” Ashley said .
Kenzie smiled .
“
Any thoughts , Victoria ?
” Rain asked .
“
What I ’m hearing , ”
I spoke slowly as I thought things through mid - sentence , “
Is that for any dangerous person or group to influence the prison population , it would be hard to reach enough people .
”
“ They would have to be staff , ” Rain said .
I nodded slowly .   
“
It ’s possible , and it fits better with the picture we have .
It ’s also pretty worrying , if true .
”
“
We ’ll look , ” Ashley said .   
“
It ’s easier , because we see staff more often than we see other prisoners .
”
“
Let me know if you need anything , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I ’m at your disposal .
”
“ I need you to not do too much , ” Ashley said .
“
I ’m not .   
School is handled , I ’m ahead in most of my classes , which is easy since it ’s only half days , and I ’m more or less getting enough sleep .
”
“ Take it easy .   
Step away from the tinkering , be a kid .   
Run in circles in a field or whatever it is kids do , ” Ashley said .
“ Running in circles in a field ?   
How long was it since you were a kid , Ashley ?
” I asked .
“
A long time , ” she said .   
“ I did n’t get to enjoy my childhood as much as I wanted , and I ca n’t remember those days very easily .   
I do n’t want one of my favorite people to make the same mistake I did .
”
“
You ’re one of my favorite people too ,
” Kenzie said .
“ Powers have a way of taking over , and tinker powers like yours , Kenzie , they ’re especially bad for it .
”
Rain ’s voice was a touch testy as he said , “ I like how you ’re saying that while I ’m on hour … holy , it ’s been two and a half hours that I ’ve been working on your hands here .
”
“ Shh , ” Ashley said .
“
Rubbing that salt into the wound .   
I ’m kidding .   
It ’s nice to do something practical .
”
He sounded so easygoing , considering his incarceration .   
Ashley , meanwhile , seemed a bit subdued .
“ And familiar faces , ” Ashley said .   
She looked at the phone ’s camera , locking eyes with us .   
“
I ’m glad you called , Kenzie .
”
“
Just so you know , I am going to take a break from the tinkering tonight .   
Victoria ’s coming over for dinner .   
We ’re having pasta , we ’ll talk with my parents , who seem to really like her , my mom especially , and I can show her my workshop with everything I ’ve been doing .
”
I did n’t miss the pause after , or the looks exchanged between Rain and Ashley on the tiny phone screen .
Bells chimed in the distance as the gates closed in anticipation of the train coming in .
“
Keep your expectations low , ” Ashley said .
Kenzie heaved out a sigh .   
“ Okay .
”
“
It ’s good if Victoria is visiting , ” Ashley said .   
“
More of us should have been doing that .   
I would have come over before , if it was doable .
”
“ You intimidate my parents and they do n’t want you over , so yeah , not doable .   
Really really , it does n’t need to be a ‘ should’ thing , ” Kenzie said .   
“
And you all have your own expectations and ideas going in that
makes it awkward .
”
“
Is there anything I need to worry about ?
”
I asked Ashley and Rain .   
I picked up the bags , slinging them over the one shoulder .
“
Seee ?
” Kenzie cut in , bringing the phone closer to her face .   
“
You two are making it awkward .   
She ’s worried .
”
“
Wondering if I need to be worried , actually .
”
“
You ’re fine if it ’s you , Victoria , ” Rain said .
“
Yeah , she ’s fine , ” Kenzie said .   
She shook her head and smiled .   
“
I ’m having a friend over .   
It ’s not a big deal .
”
“
It ’s a big deal to you , for one thing , ” Ashley said .
“
Because I never used to get to have friends over , not because there ’s any need to be worried , geez !   
My mom ’s a good cook , I have stuff I want to show off ,
and-
”
“
She ’s not your mom , and that ’s not your dad .
” We ’d been making our way to the front door of the train station when Ashley said it .   
Kenzie stopped in her tracks .
“
Ah man , ” Rain said , in the background .
People walked past us to enter the station .   
While Kenzie and I stood still , the crowd moved on .   
The train pulled into the station , noisy as it approached , muffled somewhat as it passed indoors .   
It drowned out everything and brought all conversation to a halt .
Kenzie hit a button on her phone , and held it to her ear , her back to me .
There were a dozen things I wanted to say or do , and I held my tongue .   
There was still the train ride , and it would only frustrate if I interrupted a conversation now .
“
Ashley-
” she said .   
“ Ashley , ugh , let me talk , okay ?   
Because I have a train to catch .   
You ’re wrong , you ’re lying , and I ’m really bothered you ’re lying .   
I ’m really tired of this .   
That was rude .
”
A pause .
“
Yeah , well , I love you a lot
but I do n’t like you a lot right now .   
I ’m going to hang up .   
Hm ?   
Yeah .   
Okay .   
Fine .
”
She hung up , spun in a half circle to face me , and smiled .   
“
Sorry .   
She wants you to call her at the end of the night , if possible .   
She says she spent some time in Earth N at one point , getting the lay of the land , she can give tips on who ’s there .
”
“ I will .   
Kenzie , I have a lot of questions , ” I said .
“
Can we not make a big deal of this ?
” she asked .   
“
There ’s the train to catch , and I meant what I said about not wanting you to be prejudiced or anything .
”
“
Catching the train ?   
Sure , ” I said .   
“
We can do that , and I can come over .   
I wo n’t break my word like that .   
I just … want to make sure
I ’m not missing anything vital .
”
“
I ’m safe
, you ’re safe .   
My parents are safe , and they are my parents , just to make that clear .   
I have pictures of them holding me while I ’m a baby .   
I do n’t have any runaway tinkerings , there wo n’t be any captives in the basement , nobody ’s going to die or get maimed .   
There ’s nothing ‘ vital’ .   
Can we just go ?
” I nodded .
We walked to the train , joining the tail end of the short line of people that still had n’t boarded .
“
We all have weird or broken families , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Rain does n’t have any family he gets along with .   
Ashley does n’t have anyone except her twin .
”
“ Twin ?
”
“
Kind of .   
Her roommate , now .   
Sveta only has Weld , Chris does n’t have anyone , Tristan and his parents do n’t talk
and he only gets to see them because he goes to Church with them .   
Byron has it easier but it ’s still awkward .   
You ’ve got family business
I ’m not going to poke my nose in .
”
“ Thank you .
”
“
So it leaves Byron and me with mostly normal families .   
I can say the word ‘ family’ and half the people in the group get a teeny - tiny surly or sad look on their face and the other half get an ‘ oh no’ look .
”
“ Which one am I ?
” I asked .
“ Depends on the day , but you ’re a tie - breaker a lot of the time , so that ’s fine .   
What I ’m saying is everyone has these ideas going in , some of which are outright wrong , like Ashley ’s , and something as simple and basic as dinner with family and it becomes this big thing .
”
We boarded the train .
“
What am I even supposed to do in this situation , Kenz ?
”
“
Do what you were going to do .   
I know you checked up on Chris
and he did n’t like that , and this is you checking up on me .   
Difference is , I ’m
okay with that
, I ’m even happy you care .   
Just don’t- do n’t go in with the wrong ideas .   
Because that ’s not fair .
”
I considered that for a moment .   
I saw her looking up at me with large eyes , kinky , glossy hair in two balls close to the base of her neck .
No judgment .   
I gave her a nod , and she practically skipped at the confirmation , like the moment gave her a boost that accelerated her , saw her moving ahead in the aisle to a possible seating location .
We took up one set of four chairs , each of us taking two seats , depositing our bags and things in the empty seats .   
Kenzie looked around a few times before putting down her helmet and cloaking device , the visuals distorting as the cloaking adjusted to the change in orientation .   
The seat - bottom briefly disappeared as the camouflage took hold , Kenzie tapped the cloaked cloaking device , and it returned to normal .
“
It ’s not a long trip , ” she said .   
“
We ’re going to the next station .
”
“ I know , ” I said .   
“
Then , in the interest of finding something to talk about that wo n’t take too long ,
how ’s school ?
”
Maybe not the right subject for a short conversation .   
The reality was that Kenzie was a teacher ’s pet , and I actually really liked school and studying , with some hope of studying in the future , if I could get into classes .   
Despite the ten year age difference between us , it was a pretty decent back and forth .
“
What kind of projects ?
”
she asked , as the train came to a stop .   
The station beyond the window was a temporary one .
“ With parahuman studies ?   
A lot of it is theory and extrapolating from what little we know .   
I ’m really eager to see how the classes change in the future , since we know different things than we did four years ago .
”
“ I do n’t think I ’d want to study that stuff , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I think it ’s super cool , do n’t think I ’m a jerk for pooh - poohing what you like .
”
“ Not at all .
”
“
But I do n’t know what I ’d want to do .   
It seems very far off .
”
“
You ’re in fifth grade .   
You ’ve got seven years before you have to make any decisions .
”
“ Seven years .   
There ’s part of me that wants to be an adult already
and there ’s another part of me that really , really does n’t .
” We were stepping off the train .   
Not many got off at the temporary station in Norwalk , and we had some privacy .
“ Why do n’t you ?
” I asked .   
“
Is it the idea of having romantic feelings being uncomfortable ?   
You mentioned that once .
”
“
See , it ’s funny
you ask that , because I mentioned it in group once .   
Ashley asked the opposite question .   
She asked why I would want to .   
Chris asked something similar to you .   
He wanted to know why I would n’t want to grow up .
”
“
And ? ”
“
And I do n’t know , ” she said .   
She smiled .   
“ Both have issues , being here , being grown up .   
I think I ’d like to fix things and figure myself out , and get most of the way to being better over the next few years .
”
“
It ’s a good goal .
”
The conversation carried on for a bit , Kenzie walking on the concrete barrier between lawns and road , heel touching toe , arms out to the side .   
Periodically , she ’d poke me in my uninjured arm as she used me to catch her balance again .
The wind was the prime culprit in her losing her balance .   
The portal loomed above us , the sky on the far side now overcast , with clouds seeping in through like they might through a crack in glass .
Many houses had been vacated , or had signs on the lawns .   
There were n’t many cars on the road or in driveways for what should have been a settled residential area .
A nice residential area .   
When so many houses across the city and especially in Earth N were prefabricated or rushed out , the houses here were three stories , with built - in garages .   
Driveways were often brick laid out in patterns .   
Things marked it as different from the Earth I ’d grown up in .   
Lawns were transplanted from the landscape that had been here prior to the houses going up , or the existing material had n’t been removed .   
The ground was uneven , rough , with dense weeds often overtaking or replacing grass .   
Where trees stood on many lawns , the trees were older , less cultivated , with stubborn and jumbled root systems and gnarled branches .   
Many had burls .
The veins of gold and yellow ran through much of it , too .   
The middle and sides of the road were marked with serrated lines of yellow triangles .   
The area did n’t have a dense assortment of streetlights , and I imagined the triangles were meant to catch headlights in the dark , so drivers would see three dotted yellow lines marking the bounds of the road .
Fences , trees near the road , rocks at the corners of property and other potential obstacles had their own dashes of yellow paint , stickers , or ribbons .
Kenzie ’s house was steel gray , consisting of three sections , with only the rightmost having a third story- and it had a garage below that taller section .   
The roof was peaked over the front door but sloped toward the front , everywhere else .   
The windows were large , modern , with stained glass in frames hanging in between many of the windows and the curtains .   
Clear glass , gray - black tinted glass , and rose pink .   
Two cars in the driveway , with one being the van that Kenzie had used in the past to transport her tinker stuff .
She had a key hanging from a chain at her neck , and used it to let us in .
The walls were eggplant , and it somehow did n’t look terrible .   
Monochrome art and art that was mostly monochrome with really bold yellows and oranges to catch the eye ran through the entire foyer , with more pictures going up the wall in parallel with the stairs .   
I could smell Italian spices
and I could hear a volatile hiss of steam from the kitchen as meat cooked .
“
I ’m home !
”
Her mother appeared in the doorway of the kitchen , apron on , color matched to the slate walls and blue decor of the kitchen I could see behind her .   
She used a tea towel to dry her hands .
“ Victoria .   
It ’s so nice to have a guest .   
We do n’t get the opportunity that often , because we have a tinker in the house , who does n’t always clean up after herself .
”
“ Mommmmm .
”
Irene pursed her lips together , before giving me a bit of a smile .   
“
Everything went well today ?
”
“
Reasonably well , ” I said .   
I pulled my bag around .   
“ I wanted to bring wine , but it was n’t doable since we thought we might get into a fight .   
I brought chocolate .
”
“
Chocolate is always welcome , ” Irene said .   
She took the box .   
“
Ooh , very nice , thank you .   
It ’s good to hear it went well .   
I ’m curious about who our neighbors just past that portal are .
”
“
I ’ve met them
and I ’m still not sure who they are ,
” I said .   
“
I could tell you later .
”
“
At dinner , maybe , ” She said , smiling .   
“
How are you , Kenzie ?
”
“
I ’m good , thank you for asking ,
” Kenzie said .   
“ Dinner smells amazing .
”
“
Which reminds me !   
Victoria , are you hungry ?   
I ’m trying to decide how much pasta and garlic bread to make .
”
“
I ’m ravenous , actually .   
Errands took a while today
and I did n’t get the chance to eat lunch .
”
“ Perfect .
”
Kenzie spoke up .   
“
I do n’t eat a lot , and I ’m pretty regular about not eating a lot .   
My mom got fed up with asking me because the answer was always the same-
”
Kenzie ’s hands squeezed her middle , pressing her shirt against it , showing how narrow she was .   
She looked at me , then saw the bags I was holding .   
“
Oh !   
Put that down somewhere .
”
“ You can put things down in the corner of the living room , ” Irene Martin said .
The living room was more a lavender than an eggplant , with dense white carpet and nice looking furniture .   
The lighter shade of the room worked with the way the light flowed into it .   
At one corner of the room , a tarp had been laid out .   
An easel was on the tarp , a wooden rack of paints set beside it .
A collection of gears and bits of glass were arranged on one half of the coffee table , on a newspaper .   
The paper , gears and glass were dusty .
“
Mom ’s art , ” Kenzie said , indicating the easel .   
“
She ’s terrible at a lot of the artsy stuff until she gets practice in , and then she ’s really talented .
”
“
That ’s not nice to say , that I ’m terrible , ” Irene said , from behind us .
“
It ’s true , though !   
You ’re really , really good at stuff when you learn it .   
You ’re an amazing cook , you had some awesome stained glass art , before , I remember it .   
It was better than what you have in the windows now .
”
“
That was a long , long time ago , ” Irene said .   
“
I ’m surprised you remember it .
”
Kenzie nodded , energetic .
“
I ’m not a proper artist ,
” her mom said , as she looked past us to the painting .   
“
I do n’t have my own ideas , I spin off on other people
’s .   
Besides , I have no patience to stick it out .
”
The painting was in shades of indigo through to midnight blue , three old women clawing at each other in efforts to reach for the sky , expressions contorted .   
It was n’t complete , with one old woman with a shawl over her head left undone , face left as only a midnight blue oval , hands left similarly undefined .
“ You painted that ?
”
“ I was .   
It ’s not done .
”
“
It ’s really good .
”
“
Thank you , ” she said .   
She put a hand on my shoulder .   
“
I ’ll get back to it someday .   
Do you need anything ?
”
I shook my head at the offer .
“ Julien is out to pick up some ingredients I forgot .   
He ’ll be back in a few minutes .   
Why do n’t you give Victoria a tour , Kenzie ?   
We ’ll talk over dinner .   
I ’m interested to pick your brain and learn more about what you ’re doing .
”
“
Sounds good ,
” I said .
Kenzie led me up the stairs to the top floor .   
Black and white photos showed Julien and Irene together .   
Here and there , there would be one of Kenzie .
“ I ’ll show you my room !
”
Irene was an interior decorator , if I remembered right .   
I was left with the feeling that the house was being presented as a kind of showcase , more than it was a lived - in place .   
The wall colors were striking , the artwork eye - catching to a distracting degree , with bright reds and yellows in otherwise muted rooms , and the style was unerringly consistent across the rooms I ’d seen .   
I felt like being in this house for too long might give me a headache .
“ Bathroom , if you need it , ” Kenzie said .   
“
My dad ’s study .   
He sometimes goes in there to smoke with the fan blowing it out the window , but it stinks so we keep the door closed .   
My parent ’s room is at the end of the hall , and this is my room .
”
Every room thus far had been cool blues and purples with monochrome flooring , artwork , and tiles , a few points of colorful definition aside .   
Kenzie ’s room was unpainted , the walls plastered with art .   
Her bed was made in a way that made me think she ’d done it herself , rather than have either parent do it , and there were two desks and one bookshelf , all strewn with papers and pieces of things .   
Plastic bins held a few dozen random pieces of electronics each .
I could smell the food cooking downstairs .   
I was ravenous .
“
You said you moved around a lot .   
Is it nice to have a place to stay and make your own ?
” I asked .
“
It so is , ” she said , bouncing on the spot .   
“ Team poster .   
There I am .
”
It was a poster of the Baltimore PRT .   
Mayday was on it , though he was n’t in the leader position ; he took the second position of the line that formed where each adult member of the team stood behind the right shoulder of the person in front .   
The Wards were a numerous bunch , not as organized as the Protectorate , with some sitting or crouching in front of the lined - up heroes , others gathered on perches behind the members of the group at the rear and far right of the line .
I could see Kenzie .   
She looked tiny , a singular lens dominating her mask .   
Her arms were very skinny , and her hands were buried in gauntlets that made each hand look the size of her head , each with a lens on the back .   
“
There you are , as Optics .   
With camera hands ?
”
“ I called them mugshots .   
They were n’t very good and they never let me use them outside of training .   
If you squint , you can see my flash gun .
”
“ I can .   
That ’s really cool , ” I said .   
“ The old team .
”
“ I miss them .   
There ’s Avian , Stungun , Keychain , Blush , and
there ’s Houndstooth .   
And that ’s Mayday , you see , and Turtleshell , Aerobat … and some I never even got to have conversations with .   
They were always busy .
”
“ I recognize a lot of those names , ” I said .   
“
It ’s a good poster .   
You managed to find it after everything happened ?
”
“
My mom and dad paid to have people get stuff from the house , but the poster did n’t make it .   
There was a picture in a magazine they kept , though .   
I took it and blew it up .   
It ’s not as sharp and details are misplaced where I enhanced the quality a bunch of times and the computer guessed wrong , but it ’s pretty good .
”
“
There are a few things I wish I ’d been able to salvage , ” I said .   
“
Others I managed to get .   
A poster .
”
“ I got this , too .   
It ’s not the original , but it was in the background of a picture on a memory card , and the program kept the lettering from on the frame .
” I had to walk around her shelf of plastic tubs to see .   
Alone on one empty space of wall was a picture frame with a very thick frame , the actual picture so small I could have put my hand flat against the glass and covered it .   
It was Irene , not as expertly put together , but very tired , with a swaddled Kenzie in her arms .   
The picture was n’t black and white , like so many family and individual pictures in the house , and thick letters spelled out the name ‘ KANZI’ below the image .
“ Kanzi ?
”
“
My name .   
I never liked having to explain it .   
I ’d always have to spell it out .
”
“ I like it , ” I said .   
“
But I like Kenzie too .
”
She nodded in a very aggressive , overly done way , before leading me around the room .   
“ More old team stuff , see ?   
I had an Optics trading card .
”
“
A swipe card , ” I said .
“
Yes !   
You know about swipe cards !   
That ’s cool .
”
“
Can I ? ”
“
Yes , for sure .
”
She seemed happy , enthusiastic .   
The card was framed , but the frame was attached to the wall with a string , and it could be flipped around to show the back .   
The stats were on it , along with the ability .   
People who played on console would have the cards at hand , being able to swipe the card like one might a credit or debit card , summoning an ally or generating an effect .
“ I was a support card .   
Not a lot of people used me because I could n’t be summoned into a fight , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Kind of a bummer .
”
Amy had been a support card for that game
, I was pretty sure .   
The effect had been downplayed a lot , but her card had still been popular , because there were n’t that many heals .   
Most of what I knew had come from Dean , Chris , and Dennis talking .   
Gallant , Kid Win , and Clockblocker .
“
I have one too ,
” I said .   
“
Mine was n’t anything special , despite my being popular - ish at the time .
”
“
That ’s so cool .   
Let me see , I think I have other stuff .   
Old merch that I found .   
It ’s so hard , with the world ending and everything .
”
She rummaged .   
I looked at the other wall decoration .
Group therapy seating chart .   
Kenzie connected to Sveta and Chris .   
Chris to Damsel , Damsel to Rain , Rain to Tristan , Tristan to Sveta , forming a circle .
There were notes .   
Between Ashley and Rain was ‘ hands’ and ‘ not rich’ .   
Between Rain and Tristan were ‘ regret’ and ‘ teenage boys’ .   
Between Tristan and Sveta was ‘ Weld’ and ‘ hero’ , and so it went .   
Other notes cluttered margins , seemingly more about groups of three or group therapy in general , with topics of past discussions in tiny scribbled font and hatch marks or symbols here and there .
The note that caught my eye was Chris and Ashley .   
There was ‘ dark’ , ‘ switch places?’ and then a question mark by note I could n’t make out without bringing my face closer to the paper .
Yamada said they have a lot they can talk about
but what ?   
Does n’t say .
“
My seating chart !
”
Kenzie said , with an energy and suddenness that made me jump .   
“
Do n’t get me started .   
Really truly do n’t , because I could talk forever about the group , and I want to talk about other stuff .
”
“ I wo n’t , do n’t worry .
”
“ I have other merch that was from a bag of plastic things that was the size of my head .   
They were selling each bag for twenty bucks , when before it would have been , like , four .   
I wanted Baltimore PRT stuff .   
I found mine !
”
It was a plastic disc with an image embossed onto it , the kind of thing that might have dropped out of one of the glass cases with a quarter and a crank from outside grocery stores and mall entrances .   
Optics .   
There was one for Houndstooth , and one for a cape I did n’t recognize in the slightest .
“
It ’s great that you were able to find mementos like that , ” I said .   
I held up Optics to tilt the disc and let the light and shadow hit it in a way that made the lines clearer .   
“
I wish I had more of these sorts of things .
”
“ They were good days ?
” Kenzie asked .
I nodded .   
“
I have regrets about things I did n’t pay enough attention to , but they were good days .
”
“ I think it ’s pretty important to hold onto the memories .   
Oh !   
That ’s a great reason for me to show you this !
”
And then she was off , through the door with only a half - second glance to check
I was following .   
When I was n’t fast enough behind her , she reappeared in the door , all excitement .
“ Lead the way , ” I said .
So far , not too bad .   
She was a kid .
I glanced back at the room , which did n’t match the rest of the house at all , and closed the door behind me before following .
Kenzie waited at a door that led from the front hall to the garage .
“
My workshop , ” she said .   
“
Do n’t trip on any wires or things could get messy .   
Too many things you could knock over if you were stumbling around in the dark .
”
It was , as garages went , pretty standard .   
Concrete floor , wood , exposed wiring .   
Tinkertech was spaced out through the garage , with a table housing most of the completed works , another with tools and what looked like the project of the now , and two large cubes , one of which I recognized as the projector box .
“ Teleportation project , discontinued , ” she said .   
She had her phone out and in hand , screen illuminated , and waved it in the general direction of one box which looked like a cube shaped egg had cracked , revealing the internals , which featured a vague , foot - long approximation of a human skeleton in it , if the skeleton was made of metal boxes and electronics .   
“
There ’s the time camera , you know
that one .
”
“ I do , ” I said .   
I noted that it was open and in pieces .   
“
You ’re updating it ?
”
“ Fixing .   
Maintaining .   
Stuff breaks down constantly so it takes more time .
”
I had to ask .   
“
You ’re not working too hard ?
”
“
Bed by eleven , ” she said , confidently .   
“
I do n’t always sleep when I ’m in bed , but I ’m still in bed by eleven .
”
“
The sleeping is the important part , ” I said .
“
Catching the bad guys and kicking enough ass that we get famous and everyone loves us is important , ” she said .   
“
Nobody says , gee Kenzie , you went to bed so nicely two months ago .   
They say wow , you built a camera that can see someone ’s innermost desires .   
How much do I have to pay you to keep mine quiet ?
”
There was a gleam of mischief in her eyes when I looked her way .   
She looked down , checking her phone .
“
What ’s your usual asking price for staying quiet ?
”
“
Oh , it depends on how horrendous it is , but it ’s not usually about money .   
Big burly guy has a secret dream of being a ballerina ?   
I ’ll go easy .   
I ’ll tell him he needs to give me a hug and go take a dancing lesson , pursue that beautiful dream .   
If he ’s stubborn or scared then I ’ll make him take me out for a frozen treat once a week instead , use those opportunities to turn the screws on him .
”
“ Is that how it works ?
”
I asked .
She played at being serious as she looked down at her phone , tapping some keys .   
“ Yep .   
If it ’s a less beautiful innermost desire , like , I do n’t know , skinning people , then I ’d set the price at ten million dollars or something .   
Then I ’d turn them in anyway .
”
“ Eminently reasonable , ” I said .   
I bent down by the table , noting the various lenses and segments of metal with holes in them .   
There were computer chips that had been cannibalized , and others that had been rebuilt into Frankenstein abominations .   
“
Where do you get the money for these parts ?
”
“ Parents , ” she said .   
“
Some scavenging .   
There was a while where people were getting really bad computers that had been scavenged from Earth Bet and cleaned up , except a lot of those computers were total garbage .   
Every garbage day I could go out with a wagon and get at least two .
” I nodded .   
I could n’t really parse the logic of some of the layout , organization , or what had actually been built .   
At a certain point , stuff ceased to become computer chips and became three dimensional arrangements of pins .   
There was one that used magnets to suspend a part in between three other chips .
“
I ’m joking , by the way , about the desire camera .   
I tried that
and it did n’t really work .   
I ’d need a ton of scans to even know where to start .
”
“ I figured , ” I said .
“
This is the camera
I ’m
working on for Tristan and Byron , ” she said .   
She gave a box a pat .   
Whatever was inside , it was a pale energy that licked the clear lens .   
“
It ’s missing stuff .   
”
“
Out of curiosity , what sort of thing would that see , besides them ?
”
“
No idea .   
But if I can figure it out , I think I can leap from it to other things .   
It might open doors , if i can just figure out how to see into the keyhole .   
What those doors look like really depends on what Byron and Tristan are .
”
“
At my apartment , I have papers on stuff like where the physical bodies of breakers go when they ’re in breaker mode , or offloaded consciousnesses in nonstandard brains .   
I ’m not sure if any of it would help in terms of inspiring tech , but maybe it could help you make some educated guesses .
”
“ That ’d be amazing .   
I do n’t know if I ’d understand it all .   
Could you explain what I do n’t get ?
”
“
I ’d love to , ” I said .   
“
Really , I enjoy the heck out of that stuff , and I ’d love to try teaching it .
”
“
Awesome , ” she said .   
She nodded , all energy and hasty nods as she was ready to jump straight to the next thing .   
She had her phone out , setting it on the table next to her , and she gave it a spin , so it twirled in a circle for a moment .   
“ I want to help them .
”
“
Me too .   
I want to help a lot of people .
”
The phone stopped .   
Kenzie angled her head , staring at the screen .
“
Something up ?
” I asked .   
How awkward would it be to come all the way here , only for us to get pulled away for cape duties or to help one of the others ?   
Kenzie ’s family seemed strict , and they might look poorly on a change in plans .
Still staring down at the screen , she said , “ Upstairs , I said something about memories and mementos .   
This … ”
She gave a box beside her a pat .   
It was as tall as she was , but narrow .   
A pillar , more than anything .
“ Is my diary .
”
“ Your diary ?
”
She looked away from the phone , giving me another hurried nod , her eyes wide .   
“
Basically .
”
“
That ’s bigger than your time camera .
”
“
It ’s kind of like the projector box , but it ’s more purposeful , ” she said .   
She pulled a shoebox from the shelf and put it on the table .   
The thing was half - filled with what looked like the kind of memory stick that was plugged into a computer to give it more random access memory .   
She fished around and pulled one out .
“
See ?   
I take this , and stick it in , make sure it ’s on , and … ”
The box lit up .   
Images filled the room .
The group therapy meeting .   
Rain ’s hair was a bit shorter than it had been when I ’d met him .
My gaze lingered on Jessica , who stood at the edge of the scene .   
I felt a pang , seeing her face .
“
Each card has notches , see ?
” she asked .   
She held up a card , showing me where there were dabs of paint at regular intervals .   
Pink , purple , pink , red , black , pink .   
Baby blue , yellow , red , yellow , blank , baby blue , yellow , red , purple .   
“
Each is a scene .
”
She cycled through the group therapy session .   
Much of the focus seemed to be on Kenzie and Sveta .
“
That ’s a lot of diary entries , ” I observed .   
A shoebox half filled with cards , each card only a little longer and thinner than a lighter .
“
Well , I ’m
cheating , kind of , ” she said .   
“
Some of it ’s the past , but some is the future .   
Stuff
I dream of or fantasize .   
It ’s nicer to have it visual like this than to just have it be random , thoughts - racing wonderings , you know ?
”
“ Dreams ?
” I asked .
“
Um .   
So like this one , if I click forward a few times …
”
Sveta and Kenzie talking , hanging out , more talks , Sveta looking upset , Kenzie giving Sveta a hug .   
Then Kenzie , Weld , and Sveta together in a domestic scene
, Kenzie sitting on a couch with a blanket around her .
“
Those last few did n’t actually happen , ” she said .
“ How do you keep track ?
” I asked .
“ Color codes .   
It ’s pretty intuitive for me , but I came up with it , so I do n’t know .   
Hmm …
”
She plugged another in , and hit the button on the top a few times before the first images had even snapped into existence .
Her and Mayday , Mayday ’s hand on her shoulder .
Kenzie stood beside her projected image and looked up at Mayday .   
I walked around to look .
“
Realistic .
”
“
Yup .
”
“
Did you tell Mrs. Yamada about this ?
”
“
Oh , ” Kenzie said , looking surprised .   
“
Um .
”
“ You did n’t .
”
“ I mentioned that I was keeping a diary , and I was trying to put my dreams and hopes down in a more tangible way .   
I just … did n’t mention that it was visual .
”
“ Why not ?
” I asked .
“
I worried she might make me stop , and I do n’t want to .   
This is a nice thing to do when I ’m feeling down .
”
I walked past her , looking at more of the scene .   
She clicked through it , stopping at an image of herself as Optics , the lenses on the gauntlets glowing bright .   
Her costume was torn , the lens on her mask broken , and she was bleeding .
“
It ’s kind of stupid , is n’t it ?
” she asked .   
“
I save everyone , and then things are finally okay .   
The weirdness between me and others stops .
”
“
I do n’t think that ’s stupid , ” I said .   
“ You do n’t have to show me , you know .   
If you want to keep it private-
”
“ I do n’t really believe in privacy , ” she said .   
“
There ’s a lot in that box , if you want to look at any .
”
I walked over to the shoebox , peering inside .
“
Um , maybe skip the ones with hot pink , unless you really , really want to .   
I ’m still figuring that stuff out .
”
“
No hot pink , got it , ”
I said .   
I looked , trying to think of how to put my thoughts into words .   
She was showing me this for a reason .
I pulled out a card .   
“ Red ?
”
“ Hurt . ”
“ Purple ?
”
“ Action scene .   
Put it in .
”
“ I ’d feel awkward .   
If this is your diary , it ’s too personal .
”
“
I ’m an open book , ” she said .   
“ Put it in .   
I ca n’t remember what that one is .
”
I popped out the one that was slotted into the top of the machine , and put the other in .
Kenzie crashing onto pavement , heels of her hands scraping , face distorted .   
An older boy stood behind her , black with a a shaved head and a school uniform on .
“
The lighter side of this is , I had to make a lot of funny faces before I got some expressions right .
”
“
Bully ?
” I asked .
“
Yep .   
I had a hard time with other students in Baltimore .   
Mostly because I ’m weird and kind of really broken .
” I clicked through .   
Kenzie fighting back .
“ Did n’t happen .   
I wondered what would happen if I did that .
”
Another scene .   
Kenzie at the office , in front of school administrators .
“ That did happen .   
I got in so much trouble even when I did n’t do anything except try not to get shoved around .   
I did n’t hit back that often .
”
Another scene .
Kenzie and the boy hugging , while a school administrator stood by with arms folded , looking grim .
“ I saw that happen on TV , and I wondered .   
Best case scenario , if that happened ?   
We hug , we make up , find common ground , and they protect me .   
I like that one .   
It ’s simple , almost maybe kind of believable , is n’t it ?
”
“ Maybe , ” I said .   
“
But someone who ’d push around a girl a year or two younger than them ca n’t be very nice .   
I feel like you deserve better than that .
” She shrugged .   
“ Thank you for saying so .   
It feels … like a relief , almost , to see these and go back to them now and then .   
Like I can make sense of everything if I can recreate it and look back on it .
”
“
Does it feel like things do n’t make sense ?
” I asked .
“
Oh yeah ,
” she said .   
“ Put another one in ?
”
“
It feels invasive , ” I said .
“
I ’m
okay with that
, ” she said .   
“
All ’s fair , when I do it to others .   
Quid pro pro .
”
I picked out one card , turning it over .   
“
I asked earlier about resources , and it looks like you ran out at some point .
”
“ Huh ?
”
“ I might be reading this label wrong , but it looks like you have a lot of cards where there are gaps or breaks between the color dabs , so you have two sets of scenes on one card .
”
“
That ’s not right , ” she said .   
She approached , reaching for the card .   
She took it .   
“
Yeah , no , you got it wrong .   
White ’s a color , it ’s just easy to miss against the white label background .
”
“ Ahh , ” I said .
“
You can figure it out if you know what the labels mean .   
Yellow , purple , red , red , white , baby blue , green .   
Purple is action , red is pain , right ?   
I went over that .   
White is an ending , baby blue is me being younger .   
Green is happy .   
So in this scene , I probably get in a fight , I get hurt , and then I die .   
Then I ’m reborn or reincarnated .   
There ’s a lot of colors , so it gets confusing .
”
I blinked a few times , taking that in , rereading the colors to verify the meaning .
She smiled , pushing the card into my hand .   
“ Put it in .   
We ’ll see if I ’m right .
”
I closed my hand around both the card and her hand .   
“
Did Jessica know about that , too ?
”
“ We talked about it .   
Not that I made realistic images or anything , but that I was exploring that stuff .
” I nodded .   
“
Are you okay now ?
”
“
I ’m happy about the Lookout thing , and the team is mostly together .   
I miss Ashley and Rain .
”
“
Are you putting white dabs of paint on chips these days ?
”
“
No , and even if I felt like it , there ’s no time , ” she said .   
“
There ’s other , exciting things to do .   
It ’s really okay .
”
“ What if … ” I said .   
“
-what if I told you to tell me the kinds of things you ’re working on , when you ’re doing projects like this ?   
You could tell me if you made anything with white dabs on the label .
”
“ Maybe , ” she said .   
“ What about pink paint ?
”
I saw that light of mischief in her eyes .
I scrunched up my nose .   
“
Hand holding ?
”
“ Kissing , ” she whispered .
“
Yeah .   
I ’ll give you advice when you get there , ” I said .
“ Sometime between a few years from now and never , ” she said .   
She ran a hand along the top of her projector box .   
“
Okay .   
I can tell you stuff .
”
“
Perfect , ” I said .   
I put the chip back in the box , then poked through it .   
“
It ’s a lot .   
How long do these take to put together ?
”
“ Fifteen minutes , maybe , ” she said .   
“
Half an hour
if I ’m doing something like watching television while I work on it .
”
“ Fifteen minutes per chip , or fifteen minutes per-
”
“ Per scene , ” she said .   
“
It ’s meditative .   
I have other stuff , like some chat bots that put out friendly messages in response to the right trigger phrases , and I ’ve been trying to befriend some birds and things in the neighborhood , but that ’s been less satisfying lately .
”
“
Seems like it ’s all variations on the same theme , ” I said .
“
It’s- ”
She stopped talking at the sound of a knock on the door .
It was Julien .
“
Can you set the table ?
” he asked .
“
Yeah , for sure , ” she said .   
She turned back to me , “ I want to show you preliminary stuff after dinner .
”
“ I ’ll look forward to it , ” I said .   
I followed her out of the garage and into the hallway .   
“
Hi , Mr. Martin .
”
“
It ’s good
you could come , ” he said .   
“
How ’s the arm ?
”
“
Sore , but I ’d put up with the pain just to have it out of a sling and be able to use my arm .   
The only reason I do n’t is that I ’m pretty sure it would cause long term damage and slow the healing .
”
“ Follow those doctor
’s orders , ” Irene said .
“
That ’s the plan , ” I said .
In Julien ’s face , I could very much see what I sometimes described as a solemn expression on Kenzie , but it was his default expression , and it read more like the dignified and not - cheerful part of being solemn , while I tended to interpret Kenzie ’s expression as a deep sincerity .
Was that unfair ?   
Maybe it was a bad read , one way or the other , and father and daughter were more similar than that .
She ’s not your mom , and that ’s not your dad .   
I remembered Ashley ’s words .   
I ’d promised to set aside judgment , and give Kenzie ’s family a fair shake .   
There were things that were weird , but sometimes people were weird .
Weird , that the only pictures I ’d seen of her were of her being held as a baby and her in the last year or so .   
Weird but not unheard of , when so many people had lost homes or possessions on Gold Morning and in the months following .
“
How ’s the work , Mr. Martin ?
” I asked .   
“
Things must be hectic .
”
“
Things are a nightmare , ” he said .   
“ Vacancies , a shift in population , trying to sell properties only for the power to be off when people are visiting .   
Has there been any news about who did it or how ?
”
“
We know how .   
When it comes to the who , we ’ve been closing in a bit .
”
“
How ‘ we’ is this ?
”
Irene asked , stirring red sauce with a spatula .
“
Actually , it ’s very ‘ we’ .   
Our team has been making headway .   
Kenzie has been a massive part of that .
”
“
Thank you , ” Kenzie said , perfunctory .   
She offered me a tight smile as she set out napkins , forks and knives .
“
I ’m not surprised , ” Julien said .   
“
She ’s something .
”
“ Penne with spicy Italian sausage and    tomato - basil pasta sauce , ” Irene announced .   
“ Julien ?
”
Julien took the plate .   
“ You ’ll have to tell us what happened with this-
what do they call them ?   
Corner worlds ?
”
“ Corner worlds .   
We went out this afternoon .   
We had a chat with Lord of Loss , Marquis , and a few others .   
It was , as those things go , pretty friendly .
”
“
Some unfriendliness , but that was mostly from locals ,
” Kenzie said .
“ Definitely , ” I said .   
“ Anti - cape sentiment .   
It ’s bubbling beneath the surface .
”
“
I ’ve heard it , ” Julien said .   
He took another plate , setting it on the table .   
“ I do n’t join in .   
It would backfire if I did and it came out
I have one for a daughter .
”
“
And , you know , it ’s kind of wrong , huh ?
” Kenzie asked .
“ Sit , ” Julien said .
“
Huh ?   
Huh ?
”
“
Do n’t be a pest .   
Sit .   
Table ’s almost set .
” I sat .   
Kenzie went to get a jug of water and a jug of something else , bringing them to the table .
“
It smells amazing , ” I said .   
“
Ca n’t wait .
”
“
My mom ’s a great cook , ” Kenzie said .
“
Now , if I remember right … ” Irene said .   
“
You ’re from a family of parahumans ?
”
“
Tough topic , no - go , ” Kenzie said , as she put salt and pepper shakers on the table .
“
No - go , ” Irene said .   
“ School ?   
Work ?
”
“ Between both , but
I studied Parahumans before Gold Morning .
”
“
And she worked on Patrol block , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Capes and portal stuff .
”
Irene laughed a bit .   
“
It starts and ends with the powers with you .
”
“ It does .   
I ’ll admit that .
”
“
It ’s all so dangerous , is n’t it ?
” Julien asked .
“ Dad . ”
“ Sorry .   
I said I would n’t , and then I brought it up ,
” he said .
I took one chair .   
Irene sat across from me , with Julien beside her .
Kenzie did n’t sit , instead picking up her plate .
“ Kenzie ?
” I asked .
“
Do me a favor ?   
Do n’t make a big deal of it ?
”
“ Of- ?
”
She took her dad ’s plate , and set it where hers had been .   
Her own plate went in front of her dad .
His expression changed .   
Solemn and grim both .
“ Eat your own dinner , ” her mother said .
Kenzie marched around her dad , situating herself between both parents , and picked up her dad
’s plate .   
She deposited most of the contents on her mom ’s plate , with pasta , sausage , and red sauce spilling over onto her mother ’s lap .
Her mom pulled her hands away , her face screwing up for a moment before she forced it back to something almost normal .   
She did n’t touch or wipe at the food .
“ Kenzie , ” I said , standing .
“
Sit .   
Please .   
It ’s just family weirdness , okay ? ”
“
This does n’t seem okay at all .   
What ’s going on ?
”
The fork scraped against the plate as she distributed food and stirred it up .   
Her meal was mixed into her mom
’s ,
some of her mom ’s meal shoveled onto her father ’s plate .   
There was a fair bit of mess .
Irene started to stand , getting in my way of getting to Kenzie in the process .   
Kenzie almost yipped out out a , “ No .
”   
There was n’t a better word for the tone .
“
You should n’t tell us what to do , ” Irene said .   
She grew more incensed , impassioned .   
Her fingers gripped the table
’s edge .   
“
You need to eat your own dinner .
”
“ It ’s done .   
It ’s not worth fighting , ‘ rene , ” Julien said .   
He looked almost defeated .   
He touched his wife ’s arm , and she stopped .   
He stroked it , and she sat down , still clearly seething .
Not that Julien was calm .   
His jaw was tense .
Kenzie scraped more , metal on ceramic , before setting the plates in position .
I rounded the table .   
I took hold of Kenzie ’s wrist before she could do more .   
“ Stop .
”
Kenzie looked at me and shot me a grin ,
“ Just-
they were n’t supposed to embarrass me tonight .   
They were supposed to be normal and this was supposed to be nice .
”
“
What ’s going on ?
” I asked .
She reached into her pocket for her phone , hitting a button before tossing it to me .   
“ Caught ’em .   
Always do .
”
It was a camera feed .   
It showed kitchen .   
I walked into the camera ’s zone , where pasta and sauce had been prepared , then looked for the camera ’s source .
The face of one cabinet , painted blue , no bumps , no dots , no markings .   
It was smooth to the touch .
“ Then eat what you were going to serve me , ” Kenzie said .   
“
You can get up from the table when you ’ve eaten it or when Victoria ’s left .
”
Neither of her parents moved or touched their utensils .
“
Yeah , I did n’t think so , ” Kenzie said .
“
What did they do ?
” I asked .
“ Does n’t matter .   
Our food ’s fine , ” she said .   
She picked up a fork and stabbed a piece of pasta on my plate .   
“ We should eat .
”
“
No , Kenz , ” I said .   
“
We need to talk about this .
”
“
You said you were hungry , and she really is a good cook , ” she said .
“ I lost my appetite , ” I said , my voice soft .   
I was n’t lying , either .   
The gnawing of hunger had become a pit in my gut instead .
She set her fork down with force .   
“
Okay .
”
“
Can I get more of an explanation ?   
This is n’t okay at all .
”
“
In the garage ?
” she asked .
I nodded .   
“
Okay .
”
She pushed her chair away from the table in a way that pushed the table toward her parents .   
She started to walk toward the garage , my hand on her shoulder to guide her and support her , and then she stopped .   
She turned toward the two , who were stone still , eyes downcast .
“
This was supposed to be a nice dinner , and it was just , what , you invited her here because you thought I ’d be distracted ?
”
she laughed , one note , smiled wide .   
“
I ’m never going to be distracted .   
I ’m always watching , okay ?   
So stop .   
Be better .
”
Neither adult moved or spoke .   
Irene visibly seethed , nostrils flaring .
Kenzie stepped into the garage , me right behind her .   
She kicked a plastic bin of nails , and sent the contents flying across the garage .








A gloomy morning was punctuated by the worst blackout the Megalopolis had suffered yet , making plans more difficult .
The city was dark , and we were well into autumn , with temperatures dipping low enough that frost dusted farms , fields , and grass .   
The sunlight that managed to reach through the clouds and touch the ground melted the frost , which then remained melted , but it was a slow , inconsistent process that would take until ten or eleven o’clock to finish its work of changing things from a dull white - frosted green to a damp , vibrant green .
The world kept spinning , like a stubborn top , the seasons changed , and I was left to consider the logistics of costumes and updating them for the coming winter .   
Ninety percent of the group ’s activities had taken place in the span between Norwalk to the west and Bridgeport to the east , and I could already tell that this area was a far cry from the more moderate , terrain - sheltered weather of the city I ’d grown up in .
The wind did n’t help matters .
It was light out , but we apparently needed power , because the blackout meant that I got a text with a change of location for the meeting .
I had the ability to do a bit of a reconnaissance sweep before dropping in , because I knew that the others would be driving , and it would take time for everyone to adapt , especially with the condition of traffic across the Gimel Megalopolis .
No major crime , even with the blackout .   
Some people were scouting abandoned buildings , looking over their shoulders to see that nobody was watching them .   
My landing near them was enough to send them running .
Mischief , likely with some intention of breaking in , but not anything I could definitively act on .
I could see the crowd of costumed individuals well before I landed .
It was interesting that the location chosen was ‘ parkland’ .   
A slice of wilderness from a foreign reality , tamed only in that the thickest of the underbrush had been cleared away .   
In a clearing , opened up on three sides by logging , a creek emptied into a fat pond .   
A rock stabbed out of the pond , of a rough size and shape to serve as a podium .
This general area reminded me of our skirmish outside of the library , in our first testing of what the team was capable of .
My initial thought was that the destination had changed because the other place had no power , and that this place would , but … obviously wrong , given that there was n’t any power out in a patch of park .
Other heroes had gathered already .   
Narwhal and Weld stood out , as part of the remnants of free and available capes from the Wardens .   
Cinereal was about as somber and intimidating in a breaker shroud of gray ash as Narwhal was scintillating and bright .
Auzure was here .   
I knew Spell , Dido , and Lark .   
Black , blue and gold .   
Uncomfortable to see them , but they did n’t seem to pay me much mind .
The Shepherds had Moonsong , who was paying a lot of attention to Capricorn .   
She was n’t in charge , though , thankfully .   
Whorl had the reins for now , and he was decent enough .
Advance Guard had turned up .   
If the Shepherds occupied the nine o’clock spot on the dial , then Advance Guard situated themselves at two o’clock .   
Their numbers had been cut down by their part in the unfortunate conclusion to the Fallen raid , and the help they had provided after .   
They were still numerous .
Foresight had n’t grown beyond its relatively narrow roster , but they had n’t shrunk or been folded into another team , either .   
We ’d continued to trade information with them up until the last moment , when we ’d switched our focus wholly to Cedar Point and the raid .
There were other players .   
Some were individual .   
Others were small teams with their own core identities , or offshoots from the other big teams .   
I saw one or two friendly or friendly - ish faces .   
Tempera .   
Fume Hood .   
Houndstooth as a ‘ friendly’ face from the Kings of the Hill .
I raised a hand in a wave as I approached .   
Tempera raised a white - painted hand in return .   
Fume Hood smiled beneath her hood .   
Houndstooth gave me nothing .
I would talk to Fume Hood and Tempera after , given a chance .
Capricorn was present in blue armor .   
Tress had a freshly painted body .   
Cryptid was camouflaged , and from the way Lookout was talking , she was having a dialogue with him .
There were n’t a ton of clear non - capes around , but our group had two in its orbit .   
I recognized Natalie , who was embroiled in a discussion with her friend , a guy with a bushy beard .
With the weather being what it was , the water being close enough that wind could blow over it and chill everyone present , and the light weight of costumes in general , a lot of people looked like they were struggling to stay warm .
Natalie ’s friend wore flannel , and Natalie wore an overly puffy coat that I was guessing would do a lot to keep her warm in this chilly weather .
“
Hey !
”
Lookout greeted me , as I got closer .
I put my hand out , and she jumped up a little in the process of giving me a high - five .   
With everything else going on since the dinner at her place , it was good to check in outside of the bounds of one on one meetings and phone conversations .
Our lives were in upheaval .   
Capricorn ’s life was overturned on two hour shifts .   
Chris’ body and schedule were mixed up by form changes , but the chaos he wrestled was one he wrestled mostly alone , in a way that only made sense to him .   
Sveta ’s boyfriend was away and the loss was felt .
Rain and Ashley ?   
Relocated as a part of incarceration .
That left me
-I’d just moved out of a desire to burn restless energy- and Kenzie , who had just turned her parents in a few days ago .
“
Hey , so rude , ” Sveta said .
I put my hand out .   
She gave me a prosthetic high - five .
“
You realize the other teams are going to see this and think we are the absolute lamest , right ?
” Cryptid asked .
Maximum sass Lookout retorted , “ You are dragging the rest of us down when it comes to the averaged numbers .
”
“ Oooh , ” he said .   
“
Just so you know , if you sound like a math dork when you ’re giving your comeback , you fail .   
I ’m sorry .
”
“ If you get a mouthful of comeback after you burp because you chug so much-
”
“
Nooo , ” I interrupted .
“
I ’m going to be glad I did n’t commit to the team thing , and I ’ll let my brother deal with this , ” Byron said .   
“ Zero guilt .
”
Byron became Tristan .   
From blue scale armor to red plate and chain .
There was a moment
’s pause as he looked around .
“
Fist bumps are better than high fives , ” Capricorn said .   
“
I ’m
pretty sure someone out there has enhanced hearing and got to hear Lookout say that .
”
“
There ’s more where it came from , ” Lookout said .   
“
I went to the training camps for Wards .   
That ’s like , ten percent kids acting like
it ’s prison and crying in a corner being homesick ,
twenty percent kids with stars in their eyes being amazed by everything , and seventy percent kids trying to establish a pecking order and murdering each other with words .
”
“
You were , what , nine ?
” Cryptid asked .   
“
I ca n’t imagine you establishing any pecking order .
”
“ I did n’t say I was one of those seventy percent .
”
“
Oh , stars in your eyes , of course .   
You have that all the time .
”
“
Ha ha , ” Lookout retorted , working her shoulders so one stuck forward with one ha , switching orientation for the next .   
“
You got it wrong again , Cryptid .   
Heart shaped pupils , not starry ones .   
Like my online handle .
”
“
That does n’t mean what you want it to mean , ” he said .   
“
But I ’m not going to try to explain it if Capricorn ’s scared of eavesdroppers .
”
“
I ’m not scared , ” Capricorn said .
“ You ’re concerned , ” I said .   
“
Let ’s change the topic .
”
Lookout jumped in , “ What we were talking about before-
Those seventy percent kids were mostly the problem cases who the higher - ups thought needed boot camp to straighten them out .   
Most became problem cases who could kick ass , instead .
”
“
Ah yeah , ” I said .   
“
I ’ve met one or two of them .
”
“ When you were a temporary Ward ?   
Oh , wait , I can take notes , look up that team and work out who .
”
“ Boundaries , ” I said .
“ Boundaries , right .   
No prob .
”
I wished I could see her face .   
The helmet she wore covered it .   
I had a sense of how she comported and conveyed herself now , and … she gave away very little like this .
There was an energy to her , a combativeness that I was n’t sure was there all the time .   
Trick was , I was n’t sure if she was more inclined to drop retorts or seize the initiative in conversation because she was unhappy , because she wanted more control , or if she was freer to do it because she was n’t spending so much energy on defending herself against her parents on a day to day basis .
I glanced back at Natalie and her colleague .
Ashley was the only person besides Jessica and maybe me that ‘ got’ Kenzie .   
She ’d signed off on my proposed course of action .   
We ’d turned the Martins in , leveraging Natalie , my mom through Natalie , my old Patrol contacts and the nebulous phrasing of ‘ the complicating factor of a parahuman in the mix’ to get people to not sweep things under the rug .
The Martins had their initial tribunal meeting .   
It helped that they were on a different track and a different field of focus than the groups that were working their way through a backlog of Fallen arrests .
Kenzie was still at home , her parents were locked up , and people from the system were staying with her at her house .   
I was being kept out of the loop on purpose , until they could make sure that everything was square .
“
By the way , just so you know , because boundaries , I ’m recording stuff for our missing team members .
”
“ Might have to edit that recording , ” Capricorn said .
“ Keeping secrets ?
”
Lookout asked .
“
Just … depending on what you pick up , ” Capricorn said .   
“
We do n’t want to get on anyone
’s bad side because you recorded them and word of it got to the wrong people .
”
“
Oh , sure .   
Recaps , maybe ? ”
“
Maybe .   
Let me glance over it before you send .
”
“ Okay .
”
“
That ’s a good policy , ” Sveta said .   
“
Back at the hospital , if we wanted to vlog or upload gaming videos , we had to run it by the people in charge , first .   
It took forever , because they did n’t want to watch through everything .
”
“ They wanted to make sure no vulnerable kids were being groomed and that there were n’t any shitstorms from kids using their vlogs to claim they were being held prisoner in a parahuman hospital ,
” I said .
“
Yeah , that , ” Sveta said .   
“
Probably a good thing for guardians to do .
”
“ Aww , are you my guardians ?
”
“
Yes , ” Cryptid said .   
“
Now go clean your room , and scrub the toilet .   
Using a toothbrush .
”
“ Ha .   
My room ’s always clean , and if I use a toothbrush on any toilets , it ’ll be yours .   
Except you ’d probably become Happy Disgust and enjoy it .
”
“
That ’s not the convention , you dolt .   
I try to make it sound good .   
It ’d be Wallowing Filth or something .
”
“
Oh God , ” Capricorn said .   
He shook his head .   
“
This team .
”
“ I ’ll stop , ” Lookout said .
“ If anyone can overhear , I think they ’ve made up their mind already , ” Capricorn said .
A few of the stragglers were arriving , now .   
The last - minute change of location had screwed some people up .   
Most fleshed out other groups .   
A few solo individuals stood off to one side .
I spotted Longscratch .   
He did n’t join Tempera and Fume Hood .
I spotted my mom and dad .   
They were together , part of the same ramshackle group I ’d seen my mom with when they ’d been dealing with the student protesters .
An odd , uncomfortable feeling , seeing that .
Dad had updated his costume a little , too .
The key players of our big meeting here were the last to arrive .   
The trees swayed as the wind changed , and the soft roar of engines preceded the display .
A Dragon - craft , sleek and powerful , loaded to bear with weapons .   
It descended slowly with engines working against gravity , emitting a blue shimmer into the air that diffused into the area , tinting the craft ’s surroundings .
It landed in the water , and the head rested on the stone .   
The occupants emerged .
Yeah , that was something .   
Wow .   
After getting taken out of the picture like I had , I ’d missed so much of what had gone on in Brockton Bay , during the latter part of the Slaughterhouse Nine attacking , the villain takeover and the heroes’ attempt to establish the peace .   
I ’d missed this .
Defiant .   
Armsmaster .
An awful lot of the bad that had flowed from that point in time had been due to a lack of leadership on the heroes’ side .   
Miss Militia had stepped up , but Armsmaster had ‘ retired’ after flipping out at the hospital .   
My sister had filled me in on details .   
We ’d been left short on good guys when we ’d really needed them .
Things were never going to be okay after an Endbringer attack .   
I knew that .   
I ’d known it to the core of my being when I ’d attended Eric and Uncle Neil
’s funerals , my dad unable to stand for segments because he had n’t had the faculties .   
I ’d known it when I ’d lost Dean .
But something had gone fundamentally wrong , even beyond that .   
Between the Endbringer first arriving and the Slaughterhouse Nine , things had gone from a bad situation to something almost unsalvageable .
I wanted to know what .   
I wanted to know more about the role he played in it or the perspective he had on it .
Because we were in a place very close to that .
“
Can we ambush them , knock them out , and then see about kidnapping the Speedrunner guys , just so I can have two forevers to look at her stuff ?
”
Lookout asked .
“
Either one of them would kick our asses , ” Sveta said .
“
I ’m
joking , ”
Lookout said .
“ Maybe if we ask nicely , ” I said .
People were drawing closer to the vantage point .   
Dragon was greeting Narwhal , leaning in close enough to say something in her ear .   
Narwhal smiled .
Defiant , meanwhile , looked pretty grim .   
When he got a nod from Dragon , he tapped his spear - butt against the rock , hard enough to be audible from the far end of the clearing .   
All conversation stopped .
“
Thank you for coming , ” he said .   
“
As of right now , the city is under a steady , surreptitious attack .   
Several arrests were made and now that we have some information , we want to make sure everyone knows the pertinent details .
”
“ If you want transcripts of the talks with the captives , you can message me at my Parahumans Online account , ” Dragon said .   
“
I ’ll send you what I can .
”
“
The attackers are Earth Cheit , ” Defiant said .   
“
The divergence point for Earth Cheit was six hundred years ago .   
There was a change in the royal line and a push for an ‘ age of enlightenment’ stance , denigrating and even criminalizing some aspects of religion .   
The backlash was severe and sharp .   
An inclusive , aggressive faction emerged in answer to it , and that faction would eventually absorb and conquer others .
”
“ The world has a population well beyond that of the Earth
Bet we knew , ” Dragon said .   
“
It also has sub - sects which are violent and willing to die for their cause .   
These people have been steadily infiltrating and occupying .   
Now they ’re escalating their attacks .   
You ’ve all heard of the attack on the refugee site .
”
Defiant shifted his grip on his spear .   
“
They go for what vulnerabilities they see , and we have a lot .   
We ’re stretched thin and it ’s easier to destroy than it is to protect .   
If you ’re willing to face this threat , expand your patrols , keep track of power lines , phone lines , railroad tracks , and key buildings .   
Hospitals , portals , schools , community centers , political offices and team headquarters are all possible targets for strikes .
”
“ If you are n’t willing to face down these people , or if you ’re a group of minors , ” Dragon said , “ Allow others to cover this ground in your territory .   
We can not allow them footholds .
”
“ Share information , ” Defiant said .   
“ Team rivalries , pride , rankings , and even financial competition should be set aside .   
If you ’re willing , and if it would make the difference , we will subsidize you in the meantime .   
If you need or want mediators , referees , or brokers for trade , we will provide them .
”
“
It ’s a state of emergency ?
” Mayday asked .
“ It is , ” Defiant said .   
“ Thinkers , strangers , some changers and some tinkers may be invaluable , given the shape this conflict is taking .
”
“
Yes , ” Lookout ’s voice was barely audible .
“
The man behind the worst of this is named Teacher , ” Dragon said .   
“
He grants thinker abilities or tinker powers .   
The tinker powers he grants may be something he ’s using to create his own temporary portals .   
It ’s not as simple as guarding the portals that already stand .
”
“ Are we considering working with villain groups ?
” a cape standing near Fume Hood and Tempera asked .
“ We have to be careful , ” Defiant said .   
“
Several are working with other groups and powers , including Cheit .   
Cheit formed loose ties with the Fallen , who are … ”
“
Antitheotical ?
” Dragon suggested .
“ Antitheotical to Cheit ’s own belief system .   
But Cheit ’s doctrine is one that accepts any sub - sect or branch religion that is willing to agree to a set of fundamental truths .   
The Fallen , with some strained interpretations , fall in line with that .
”
“ Is that where they went ?
” Mayday asked .
“
Some , ” Defiant said .
“
The new self - described Thomais branch and remnants from the attack on the compound made a break for the wilderness .   
End of Days phases things into desolate alternate worlds-
we think they gathered supplies and used a tech - augmented version of his power to escape into another world .   
They ’re migrating to a settlement that is n’t part of the Megalopolis and they ’ll emerge there .   
If we get information , we will reach out to interested parties .
”
“
Right now we ’re trying to shore up what ’s missing now that the Wardens are-
I do n’t want to say dead .   
We have no reason to believe they ’re dead , ” Defiant said .
“
Out of the picture , ” Dragon ’s voice was soft .
There were n’t many people here who had n’t felt some loss when the Wardens’ HQ had disappeared .   
Teams had called it a base of operations , worked with staff , or lost team members .
“
Yes , ” Dragon said .   
“
We ’re available .   
We ’ve already reached out to some of you , and we ’ll reach out to others soon-
our focus is split and we do have to concern ourselves with things beyond the city .
”
There was a kind of attitude shift across the crowd .   
On a level , I could get it .   
That things were sinking in .    
On another level , I felt like we were already seeing it , and that it should n’t be a surprise- even to the point that I was really kind of pissed that people were only just now getting it .
“
This is about survival , ” Dragon said .   
“
We ’re in this together .   
That ’s the gist of it .   
Talk to us if you need more information .   
We will coordinate as we develop tools and gather information that helps with this problem .
”
That marked the end of the speech .
Discussions started around us .
“
The war ’s finally reached us , ” Sveta said .
Natalie and her friend drew closer .   
I had my arms folded as best as I could with my sling on .
“
This is for real , ” Natalie said .   
“
They ’re talking about this like there ’s a very real possibility we might lose .
”
“ We might , ” Capricorn said , putting a hand on her shoulder .   
He ’d put an emphasis on ‘ might’ , but it did n’t feel like enough emphasis to change the meaning of his statement .
He was usually better about wording and presentation .
Leaving it up to me to try to rally the troops .   
“
We ’re tenacious .   
We made it this far .
”
“ Says the girl from Brockton - survived - Leviathan - Bay , ” Cryptid said .
“
Crypt , ” Sveta said .   
“ Show a little tact .   
That was n’t a good period of time .
”
Weld was making his way to us , but he was getting questions from every group he passed , and he was n’t able to disengage or dismiss as fast as they came .
This was really it , was n’t it ?   
The good guys did n’t have much more than these groups that had been called here , and there was a lot of ground to cover .   
If we left a flank undefended , then it was possible it would get blown up or dismantled .
That was without getting into the other flaws and issues .
“
Scapegoat turned coat .   
The Speedrunners did the same , ” I observed .
“ Thomais branch now , apparently , ” Capricorn said .   
“
We should talk to Rain .
”
“
In person , ” Lookout said .
“ I do n’t think that ’s possible , ” Sveta said .
“
It would be good if it was , ” I said .   
“
We need to figure something out over there .
”
We need to figure out a lot of things .
“ They might see a group visit as being a breakout attempt , ” Chris said .   
“
It sounds like a very sketchy , incomplete way of imprisoning people , they wo n’t want to add anything new or uncontrolled to the mix .
”
I nodded , my arms still folded .
My mom was off at the other end of the clearing , looking at me .
“
I ’m going to go to Weld , so he does n’t have to work so hard to get to us , ” Sveta said .
“ I ’ll come , ” Capricorn volunteered .
It left me with Lookout , Cryptid , Natalie and her friend .
I looked at the friend .   
He was red haired , with a red beard , and very blue eyes , and hooked his thumbs into his belt in a way that I wanted to describe as forced - casual .
“
I ’m Victoria .   
Antares
if you want to use something fancier ,
” I introduced myself .
“
Tony .   
I got the rundown on the group from a distance , ” he said .   
He shook my hand .   
“
I ’m
keeping an eye on things at Lookout ’s house on Tuesdays , Wednesdays and Thursdays , making a dinner , breakfast .   
Usually there are two of us there at a time .
”
“ Because I really need that much supervision , ” Lookout said .
“
We supervise each other , too , ” Tony said .
“ They thought we should send someone here for this meeting to supervise and ensure we know what ’s going on , ” Natalie said .   
“
Tony ’s a friend of a friend of mine that ’s in family law .
”
“
We saw each other a few times when we did the big friend group get - togethers .   
You know the kind , where you say hi to a bunch of people that are three degrees of separation away from you , but you do n’t ever really talk to them , ” Tony said .
“
I know the kind , ” I said , smiling .
“ We ’re talking now , ” Natalie said .
“
Everything ’s okay on the home front ?
”
I asked .   
I looked at Lookout .
“
Okay enough , ” Lookout said .   
“ Quiet .
”
“ We ’ll figure out something more long - term later , ” Tony said .   
“
For now , quiet is n’t the worst thing .
”
“
No power all last night , ” Lookout said .   
“
It ’s terrible .   
No TV , no movies , no computer , ca n’t run half my tech .
”
“
Build a generator , ” Cryptid said .
“ I ’d have to box it up , and I ’d have to make it big if I wanted to get energy from nothing , and it takes resources , and it takes time .   
And oh , duh , I ca n’t build in the dark , so I ’d need a generator to build a generator .   
See my problem ?   
Ugh .
”
“ Ugh , ” Cryptid echoed her .   
“ Try harder .
”
“ Go easy , Cryptid , ” I said .   
“
Why do n’t you go for a walk ?
”
“
Whatever , ” he said .   
The camouflage that cloaked him slipped around his body as he moved , adapting to the surroundings within a few feet of him with each step or so .
“
Come on , ” I told Lookout .   
“
You two okay on your own ?
”
“ Capes are neat , ” Natalie said , in a way that made me think she was being sarcastic .   
“ We ’ll crowd - watch .   
Right ?
”
“
Yeah , ” Tony said .
“ What are we doing ?
”
Lookout asked .
“ Checking in , ” I said .
There were too many things I needed to know , wanted to ask .   
Some were past , some present , some future .
And Lookout needed some distractions , because as far as I could tell , her home life was less mired in the bad , but there was also a distinct lack of good in it .   
I could imagine it was lonely .
As I took her hands , my eye fell on my mom , who was talking to my dad .
Even when things were n’t great , or when there was a measure of resentment or hurt feeling , there was sometimes hope .   
There was a lingering fondness .
I flew , lifting Lookout over the crowd , past Weld , Sveta , and Capricorn , who were together ,
Weld with one arm around Sveta ’s back , helping to keep her upright as they tried to talk to five people at once .
We landed on the far side .   
There was a crowd here too .   
It was more the team leaders like Mayday and Houndstooth who were lingering here .
We lingered , waiting .   
Lookout craned her head around , looking at the Dragon mech .
“
She combined my tech with that hack Brim
’s stuff for the eyes , I think , ” Lookout said .   
“
I know I signed off on other PRT tinkers using my stuff , but it kind of sucks that she did n’t use just my stuff on its own .
”
“ If you get a chance , you could ask her why .
”
“ I do n’t think I could .   
She ’s so amazing and important , and I ’d sound so petty .
”
She was interested , her attention occupied , but I had no idea on whether she was okay .   
I was n’t sure the home situation was good like this , as temporary as it was , but did she ever have a good home situation ?
I could have asked her how she was , but I was n’t sure I could trust the response .   
She would sooner tell me she was fine when she was n’t than be upfront and risk scaring me off .
Maybe … a roundabout route ?
“ If Swansong was here right now , what would she tell you ?
”
I saw her head tilt .
“
Do n’t overthink it .   
It does n’t matter what I feel or know .   
How does she respond ?   
Generally speaking , not about Dragon .   
But about anything today .
”
“ You keep telling me stuff and changing what I ’m supposed to think about .
”
“
Just … do n’t think .   
Off the top of your head .
”
“
She ’d be like , imbecile .   
Go kick ass .   
Be proud of yourself .   
I dunno .
”
“ Does n’t sound quite right .
”
“
I ’m not the Swansong whisperer , ”
Lookout said .   
“
But I know she treats me pretty nice
and she does n’t think much about other people being important .   
They ’ll all be … subservent ?
”
“ Subservient , ” I said .
“ They ’ll scrape and bow before her in the end .   
So she ’d say even Dragon should n’t be a big deal .
”
“ Maybe , ” I said .   
“
I ’m
focused more on you than on her , though .   
What would you regret ?   
Saying something and being shut down , or saying something and maybe getting a neat bit of info ?
”
Lookout shrugged .   
“
I get turned down a lot , I guess .
”
“
I did n’t mean to frame it that way , but
…
”
“
But … ” she picked up where I ’d trailed off .   
“ Ca n’t hurt too badly .
”
Mayday kept giving us more and more wary looks , until he gave Defiant a handshake and left .   
A bit nervous –
it had n’t been my intention to bring Lookout uncomfortably close to him .
My intention was more along the lines of opening a dialogue with the closest thing we had to heroes at the top .   
The new Triumvirate were all either busy or they ’d been taken when Mrs. Yamada had .   
There was n’t any clear indication .
Defiant turned his attention to us .
“ Victoria .
”
“
Defiant .   
Thank you for coordinating people .
”
“
Thank you for the information you sent us .   
We ’re still sorting through it and verifying .
”
The stuff from beyond the G - N portal .   
In drafting it , Capricorn , Sveta and I had included the details about the jail , as well as how they ’d been acquired .
“
Your mother and father are over there , ” he said .   
“
You ’re not with them ?
”
I shook my head .   
“ Not right now .
”
“
It ’s complicated , ” Dragon said , like she knew .   
When I gave her a curious look , she said , “ Your parents are working for us , until the Wardens are established again .   
In costume she ’s halfway with us , halfway with her old team .   
Whatever she prefers at the time .
” I felt uncomfortable that my mother had so casually , even easily slotted herself into this .
“
Parents are complicated , ” Lookout said .
“ They really are , are n’t they ?
”
Dragon asked .   
“
We interact now and then with your sister , just to make sure you are n’t caught unawares .
” I winced .   
I tried to be diplomatic .   
“ Makes sense .   
She ’s strong .
”
It was Defiant who mercifully changed the subject .   
“
You did a good job with the portals , getting us to a place where we could save most .   
Valefor .   
Mama Mathers .
”
“
Our team ’s collective efforts , ” I said .   
“
This is one member .   
Lookout .
”
“
I know
Lookout , ” he said .
“ We ’ve met ?
”
It was Dragon who replied , breaking away from a side conversation with Cinereal .   
As she approached , the head of her dragon craft moved slightly to follow .
“
The internet slowdown ?
” Dragon asked .
“
Oof .   
Embarrassing .
”
“
Confidential files on capes .
”
“
Yeah , ” Lookout said .   
“
Oops .   
I did n’t think it was a big deal .
”
“ If you got into the files , we might have had to take action .
”
“ Not going to do it again .
”
“
Glad to hear it , ” Dragon said .   
“
I ’ve read your file- ”
“ Oooohh .   
Oh no .
”
“
-and
I know where things stand .   
Did you need anything ?
”
“
Nothing big .   
I know you ’re busy .
”
“
The little things can matter a lot .   
I would n’t mind a brief distraction .   
What did you need ?
”
Lookout looked up at me , then over at Dragon .   
“
Why ’d you use Brim ’s visor tech with my eye tech ?
”
“ A very good question .   
If you promise to be good , and if your teammate is okay with it … ”
“
Sure , ” I said .   
“
We need her back in a few minutes , though .
”
It looked like Weld , Sveta and Tristan might soon wrap up the Warden business of corralling people and handling questions .   
The crowd was dwindling , with people breaking away to talk to others .
Lookout took Dragon ’s hand .   
The ship opened up to accept them into the bay area , where a team or cargo could presumably be stored .   
Monitors lit up around them .
“
I ’m glad you ’re better , Victoria , ” Defiant said .
“
Thank you , ” I said .   
The words were kind , but I wished I had n’t heard them , because they were a reminder .
“ I ’ve scanned files about your team members , ” he said .   
He leaned back against the side of the ship , setting the spear so it stood a few feet beside him , needing no hands on it to keep it upright .   
“
You ’ve taken on a pretty heavy job .
” I nodded .
“
I wish things had gone differently .
”
“ I want things to be different this time around .   
Thinking about the future , not the past .
”
“ I agree .
”
“
And- completely contradicting myself … Armsmaster-
Defiant .   
I do n’t know exactly what happened , when Leviathan attacked .
”
Even with the power armor he wore , not just regular armor but armor that required motors and machinery to move , I could see him draw in a deep breath .   
I could n’t see his face to read his expression .
Same as Lookout .   
Same as Dragon .
Was it because I ’d grown up with New Wave that I found it so frustrating , now ?   
I ’d always considered myself a cape at heart , and now I was feeling this annoyance at the omnipresence of something fundamental- masks .   
Secret identities .
Did I jar them just as much ?   
Did they look beneath my hood and expect to see a mask there ?
“
What about that day concerns you ?
” he asked .
“
You did something- you broke the truce .   
You were deemed guilty enough that they ‘ retired’ you .
”
“ All correct .
”
“ Eric Pelham .   
Neil Pelham .   
Shielder and Manpower ?
”
“
Yes .
”
“
You did something , and … did that something get my family members killed ?
”
“ Shielder was before my mistake .   
Manpower-
he was after .
”
“ You got him killed ?
”
“ Not through malice .   
Not even carelessness , I feel .   
My mistake was that I decided I was fine with villains dying if it meant the monster could be slain .   
By me , ideally .   
Manpower was there , but I did n’t want him to die .   
I told myself that if Leviathan had to kill someone to end up in a certain time or place , it might as well be Kaiser .   
My computer helped work out the sequence of events .
”
Shit on me .
Yeah .   
That was a violation of the truce .   
It fit neatly into things .
“
If the villains had been spared- if you had n’t started down that route ?   
Would his chances have been better ?   
Do you think Shielder could have died because you were subconsciously preparing to do this ?
”
There was a pause .
“
I do n’t know , Victoria Dallon , ” he told me .   
There was something less crisp and confident in his voice , more momentarily lost , that left me feeling like he genuinely did n’t know .   
Maybe even to the extent that it was n’t something he ’d truly considered before now .
I wanted to be angry and I could n’t .   
It just hurt .   
I felt the loss of those family members very pointedly right now , especially with Crystal away .
He went on , “
But if there ’s even a possibility , I ’d be willing to do anything reasonable to make it up to you .   
It ’s the sort of effort that keeps me moving forward .
” I nodded .
I was n’t even sure how to feel about that .   
I understood the idea , even if I hated that he might be responsible for the renewed feeling of loss I was dealing with right now .
I had n’t come here with the plan of guilting him and using that- but he was offering help and … fuck me , we needed it .
“
The prison complex .   
We have teammates there , ” I said .
“ I do n’t think we can release them .   
Things are volatile .   
Unless you have new evidence you ’d like for us to push through .
”
Kenzie needed this .   
The team needed it .








Defiant walked over to the Dragon craft , knocking on the frame of the hangar door .   
He wore power armor -armor heavy enough it needed engineering to move around- and the rap of metal gauntlet on metal frame turned more heads than necessary .
He was n’t the kind of guy who cared .   
That had n’t changed any from when he ’d been Armsmaster .   
I knew most of what I knew of him from Dean , with a little from chance encounters .
There were tinkers who were barely restrained .   
They were excited about what they did and they needed only the slightest excuse to go on at length in their attempts to explain their work .   
Then there were tinkers who were drawn into themselves , the work and the inspiration all happening in their own little world .   
Kid Win had been more the latter .   
Chariot had been , but he ’d been a special case , with reasons to keep secrets .   
Armsmaster , obviously , but that had been what had set me on this train of thought .
Lookout was the explaining , excited sort , naturally .   
Bakuda , from what I ’d heard , had been the sort to go on at length , even while in captivity , but she took that to an extreme , like it applied to other things than her tinkering .   
Bonesaw
…
yeah .
I shivered a little at that thought .   
Bakuda had been able to make bombs that threatened hundreds , thousands , or even theoretical millions of lives .   
Bonesaw worked on one subject at a time , but her ability to make actual monsters and set worse things in motion made her scarier , in my books .
I distracted myself from thinking too much about that , focusing instead on how that the names I was pulling up were so divided along the gender lines .   
Chariot , Armsmaster and Kid Win on one side , Bakuda , Bonesaw and Lookout on the other .
If I thought about it harder , putting effort into finding exceptions to that gender rule , extending my line of thought to tinkers I did n’t know but could make guesses about …
it was really hard to imagine Dragon talking about the minutiae of her work with anyone that she was n’t very close to .   
Past a certain point , professionalism had to take over .   
She could n’t risk revealing weaknesses , right ?
Trainwreck from Brockton Bay had been both a Case-53 and a tinker , reportedly .   
The guy had taken the oversized silicone testicles meant for hanging off the back of pickup trucks and incorporated them as an ‘ easter egg’ in his power armor at one point , to be revealed if the heavy metal ‘ kilt’ of his power armor moved the wrong way – usually when he vented enough steam .   
No surprise that he ’d ended up with the Merchants when everything had gone to hell .   
I had n’t interacted with him in any casual capacity , but I was on the fence about whether his demeanor meant he ’d be less guarded about talking tech , or if the fact that he ’d had to build his Case-53 body made it too personal .
Had I been able to go to college and study parahumans
-it still stung that I hadn’t-
even something as simple as the dispositions and presentations of tinkers could be something really , really interesting to look into for a paper .
I wanted to be able to do research and dig for answers .   
We ’d already unraveled some of the big mysteries , and by some tragedy , we could n’t actually work on them .   
We were n’t sharing information .
Time enough at last .
Either way , it tied back to my general observation : as Bakuda ’s personality had been colored by the same traits that made her ramble and rave about tech to even her captors , Armsmaster had taken the taciturn tinker approach and extrapolated it to the rest of his personality .   
He stayed by the door , silent , knuckles of one gauntlet still resting on the frame , and he volunteered no small talk .
In fairness , I ’d given him something to think about .   
The Leviathan attack had to be something that weighed heavily on him .
Unfair of me to confront him , but I ’d felt I owed my family that- living and dead both .   
I ’d have asked about Dean , but Dean had been injured early enough that I could n’t imagine that he ’d been swept up in the setup or rendered a casualty that might have been avoided if someone like Kaiser or one of the giantess twins had lived .
Thinking about it and
Defiant ’s place in it was heavy , so loaded that I felt inarticulately guilty by association alone .
I thought about the information and how we might share it .   
The old Parahumans Online was there , but it was bare bones , fractured , almost so messy that it was easier to restart than to fix .
“
-if I wanted to make something like that , I ’d have to make it a cube .   
I think that would be awfully silly to have a cube flying around .
”
“
You could make one of several cubes .   
Or a thousand cubes all strung together .
”
“
It ’d look awful , and the connections between cubes would be weak points .
”
“ If you want to talk about artificial and abstract constraints , the person you should really talk to is Defiant .
”
“
Really ?
”   
Lookout was coming down the ramp with Dragon beside her , Dragon offering a guiding hand at her shoulder .   
Lookout looked at the cyborg in green and gold armor by the side of the ramp .   
“ You break constraints ?
”
“ I could help work out ways to minimize the size , the scale of the weak points , limit energy loss , even the look of it .
”
“
That ’s awesome .
”
“ If you get a chance , on a day we ’re not as busy , you should have a conversation with him .   
He ’s not as intimidating as he looks .
”
“ Hm , ” Defiant grunted .
Lookout looked up at Defiant , then turned back to Dragon .   
“
But I want to keep talking to you .   
I could talk to you forever .
”
“ Not forever when we have work to do , ” Dragon said , giving Lookout a couple of pats on the shoulder .
“
Thank you for showing me stuff , ”
Lookout said , turning around , talking while she walked backward .   
I put out a hand as a just - in - case , because the ground was uneven , only recently covered in undergrowth , which had been uprooted and cut away to make this parkland accessible to humans .
Sure enough , Lookout tripped .   
I caught her weight with one hand between her shoulderblades .   
Cloaked tinkertech bounced against my wrist and forearm .
“
It was my pleasure , Lookout , ” Dragon said .   
To Defiant , she said , “ We got an alert from Valkyrie .
”
“ I saw .   
No rest for the weary , ” he said .   
“
Do you want to go ?   
Or should I call ?
”
“
I ’ll talk to her .   
We might have to go , either way .   
She does n’t call often .
”
“ I ’ll be out here until you ’re ready to go .
”
They were busy ,
so Lookout
and I said our parting goodbyes then headed back in the direction of the others .
There was no reading
Lookout ’s expression , but there was a skip in her step .
“
You happy ?
” I asked .
“
Very .   
Thank you for making me .
”
“ I did n’t make you , ” I said .
“
Yeah .
”
“
You ’re welcome , though .
”
“ I really want to see them again soon , ” Lookout said .
“ Maybe , ” I said .   
My thoughts were on their admitted association with my sister .   
That was a road fraught with hazards .
“
Did you have a good talk , at least ?   
Or was it not a talk ?   
Did you both just stand there being all grim with you having your arms folded and him looming there with his spear in his hands ?
”
“ We talked .   
I do n’t know if I ’d call it ‘ good’ .   
I got some answers on stuff .   
My shoulders feel lighter , but I ’m not sure if it ’s genuine or if it ’s because I transferred the burden over onto his shoulders instead .
”
“
He ’s strong .   
He can handle a lot , I think .
” I opened my mouth to retort , and then closed it .   
It was n’t worth arguing .
Besides , we were closer to people who could overhear and put pieces together .
Tempera and Fume Hood .   
Tempera raised a white - painted hand in a wave , and they walked over in our direction , intercepting us .
“
It ’s been a little while , ” I greeted them .   
“
Have you heard anything about Sam or Hunter ?
”
It had been so long ago-
a scared boy and his friend with new and uncontrolled powers .   
Too dangerous for me to intervene , apparently ,
but I ’d been able to tap Tempera for help , and to ask Mrs. Yamada to look in .
“
They headed over to the settlement across the ocean , ” Tempera said .   
“
It ’s smaller , with its own problems , but it has a place to hold parahumans .
” I nodded .   
“
And you guys ?
”
“ We ’ve been busy , ” Tempera said .   
“
Trying to find places where help is needed , and where we wo n’t cause too much of a commotion .
”
“
We ’re toxic , ” Fume Hood said , with some irony .   
“ I see you got hurt .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said , shrugging one shoulder .   
“ Shot .
”
“ Stupid thing to do , ” Fume Hood responded , with more irony .   
“
Do n’t do that .
”
“
All the cool kids were doing it ,
” I replied , “ A power nullifier knocked out my defenses , I figured I had one shot to get on board with the trend .
”
She slouched forward a bit , head hanging so her hood covered most of her upper face .   
Her thumbs were hooked into the belt of her outfit .   
I saw the hint of a smile on her face .   
“
If you ’re saying I ’m cool , you might have other problems .   
Any head injuries ?
”
“ Ooh , ” Lookout said .   
“
Or it could be the same thing .   
Bullets have lead do n’t they ?   
If you get traces of lead in your system , it can cause permanent brain damage .   
Among other things .
”
Tempera looked at me , eyebrow quirked-
the eyebrow had white paint from her face - paint mask on it , making the fine hairs clump .   
“ Smart kid .
”
“
I ’m not
all that smart , ” Lookout said .   
“
I just researched it a lot recently .
”
“
Oh .   
Lookout , this is Fume Hood and Tempera .   
They were at the community center attack .
”
“ I know .   
I looked everything up and I found some of the surveillance camera footage , so I got glimpses of stuff .
”
I was n’t really sure what to say to that , so I put it in my back pocket for later .   
I ’d digest it and talk to her when we were n’t in front of others , if needed .
“
That thing about it being cool to get shot- do n’t take that as an actual example , ” I told her .
“
Ha ha , ” she said .   
“ Give me some credit .
”
That was part of the general problem-
I had no idea how much credit to give her .
“
It seems you ’ve found your team , ” Tempera observed .
My knee - jerk reaction was to say no .   
That the team was breaking up , even though it was n’t .   
That it was n’t my team , even though it clearly was , now .
“
Guess
so , ” I said .   
“
You ?
”
“
Seeing where I ’m needed .   
I was with the Wardens on a trial basis until things- ” Tempera stopped herself .   
“
It was probably for the best .
”
“
For the best ?
” I asked .
“
I mean the Wardens and what they needed from me-
the rest of it was definitely not for the best .   
The work I was doing was heavy .   
Tensions between worlds .   
It ’s not me .   
I prefer community level things .   
Hands on work where improvements are tangible .   
After I moved on , I was checking in with Fume Hood before and after doing low - level cape stuff .   
Mostly refereeing riots .
”
“
It went so well last time , ” Fume Hood said .   
“
I ended up going with Tempe for a bunch more .
”
“
Wise , ” I said .
“
Oh yeah .   
That ’s me .   
I exude common sense , ” Fume Hood said .
Tempera looked back in the direction of the other members of Breakthrough .   
“
In an email a bit ago , you mentioned what you were doing at Cedar Point .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
It did n’t go great .
”
“
Well , um , ” Lookout cut in .   
“
We did scare off the villains there .   
We more or less handled it .
”
“
It was messy .
”
“
When powers get involved , it ’s always messy , ” Lookout said .
“
It ’s true , ” Tempera said .   
She produced a glob of paint in her hands , then dropped it .   
It splattered on the ground to her right .   
A moment later , it reversed course , leaping up to her waiting hand .   
“ Messy .
”
“ Neat , ” Lookout said .
“
I asked , after your email .   
People were positive about it , ” Tempera said .   
“ Cedar Point , and what you were doing .   
It got me thinking , we wanted to be community heroes , but-
there was n’t opposition .
”
“
So they created opposition , ” I murmured .   
I glanced at Fume Hood .   
“ Sorry .
”
“
The timing was wrong .
”
“ You guys are thinking about this stuff ?
” I asked .
“
After dropping the ball in our inaugural event , I think we have to , ” Fume Hood said .   
She had a billiard - ball green sphere in one hand , that she tossed into the air as she said ‘ ball’ .
“
We have opposition now , ” Tempera said .   
“
It makes it easier to be active .   
So long as people can believe we ’re doing something about this disaster with the portals , they ’re letting us be .
”
“ Maybe , ” Fume Hood said .   
“ Seems too easy .
”
“
It does tempt us down the potential road of manufactured enemies , ” I said .   
“ History ’s told that story enough times .   
But I do n’t think we have a shortage of real ones .
”
“
No shortage , for sure , ” Tempera said .   
She drew in a deep breath , then looked down at Lookout .   
“
Sorry , kid , to be talking about stuff this heavy .
”
“
Heavy and messy .   
I can handle both , ” Lookout said .   
“
So long as I ’ve got my team .   
And my team has their own people .   
We share the burdens .
”
Her focus turned to Sveta , Capricorn in red armor , and Weld , who were n’t as under siege as they had been earlier .   
No mob of questions or attention .   
Weld bent down to kiss Sveta , and held the kiss .   
Not a makeout session , but not a peck , either .
I looked away to give them their privacy , a smile finding its way to my face .
“ I like that , ” Tempera said .
“
Hey , Breakthrough , ” Fume Hood said .   
“ Are these guys enemies ?
”
My head snapped around to look at her , then followed her line of sight .
Mom and dad .
Ugh .   
“
My parents .
”
“ That does n’t answer my question , ” Fume Hood said .
To my left , Lookout stood up straighter .   
If I had n’t been watching for her body language in the absence of facial expressions , I might not have noticed .
“
We did n’t mean to interrupt , ” my mom said .
But you did , I thought .
“ Tempera , Fume Hood , Lookout , these are my parents .   
Brandish and Flashbang .
”
“
You mentioned you grew up with capes , ” Fume Hood said .
“ Yep .   
Yep .
”
“ I actually wanted to talk to Natalie , ” my mom said .   
“ Check that she ’s managing okay , with everything .   
But it would be strange , I think , if we did n’t even say hello to each other .
”
“
A little strange .
”
“ We wo n’t bother you , ” my dad said .   
“
It ’s good to see you ’re doing well .   
I like the costume .
”
“ Thank you .
”
“ I wanted to ask , ” my mom cut in .   
“
Have you heard from your cousin ?
”
I shook my head .   
“ Not since we parted ways .   
Communication is usually sporadic to begin with , but the attackers have been knocking out the phones .
”
“ You ’ll let us know if there ’s any news ?   
I worry .
”
So they were an ‘ us’ again , now ?
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“
And I hear you moved , ” she said it in a way that left the question or follow - up there only in abstract , not in any tangible form .
“
I do n’t remember the address off the top of my head , but I ’ll let you know the address at some point .
”
It was the best dodge
I could come up with on the spur of the moment .
“
I know the address , ” Lookout said .
Damn it , Lookout .
“
Remember , you never know if there are people with enhanced senses around , ”
I said .   
“
I might not have a secret identity , but it does n’t mean I trust everyone here with the address of the place I live .
”
“
Oh , for sure , ” Lookout said .
“ Very sensible , ” my mom said .
Yeah , well .   
I gave her my best convincing smile and a small nod .
She totally knew why I ’d just done that .
Turnabout was fair play , though .   
I knew why she ’d done this , pressing me for information I might have been reluctant to provide on my own .   
Telling her where I lived
meant I had to deal with that slim chance that there might be a knock on my door , with my mom , my sister , or both on the other side .
Nah .
“
Oh , Natalie brought Tony , I ’ll introduce you , ” my mom told my dad .   
She laid a hand on my arm in passing .   
“ Take care of yourself , Victoria .   
You too , Looksee .
”
“
I ’m
Lookout , now .
”
“
Oh , did you change ?   
Be careful , ” my mom said .   
“ Rebranding is a useful tool , but not if done in excess .
”
“ Yep , ” Lookout said .
My dad gave me what I decided to read as an apologetic smile , before following my mom .
I sighed .   
I glanced at Tempera and Fume Hood , and I could see Fume Hood ’s annoyance .
Wrong thing to comment on , mom .
“
Is it a problem ?
”
Lookout asked .   
“
That I changed it ?   
I used to be Optics and then Looksee , and now I ’m
Lookout-
”
“
It ’s fine , ” I said .   
“
You were never officially Looksee , really .   
Even if you were , it really does n’t matter .   
I think the mentality only really applies if it ’s twenty - twelve , you ’re in the Protectorate or an up - and - coming team , and you really want to rise in the ranks .
”
“
Was that you ?
”
Fume Hood asked .
“
A bit , ” I said .   
“
Yeah .
”
“
Is it you now ?
” Tempera asked .   
A change of wording and tense , and Tempera had a good way of sounding thoughtful , serious , and kind all at the same time .   
I could really believe that prior to Gold Morning , if her aspirations were different , she could have been great .
And in that little observation , I was already snapping over to my mom
’s kind of mindset .
“
Hard to say sometimes , ” I said .   
“
You grow up with that drive , your parent ’s ambitions in line with your own interests .   
It can be hard to separate them from your own .   
But I think so .   
Yeah .
”
“ You want fame ?
”
Tempera asked .   
“
No judgment here .   
I ’m curious .
”
“
Sure , ” I replied , taking my time with the word , feeling less sure in the two - Missisipi seconds it took me to utter it .   
“
Maybe fame is the wrong word .   
Prestige has a power to it .
”
I glanced at my mom as I said it .   
Was that her idea , too , rather than my own ?
“
Me too ,
” Lookout said .
“
Fame for me .   
I want lots of people to cheer for me and think I ’m awesome .   
Does that make me shallow ?
”
“
No , ” Tempera said .
That thought brought me to the edge of what felt like an existential cliff- the wobbly , spooked feeling that hit when at a high ledge and the brain and body momentarily forgot that flight was a thing .   
I ’d had similar wonderings when I ’d been in the hospital .   
I ’d wondered if my thoughts were my own , and it had been terrifying and maddening , because they ’d been all I ’d had .   
My heart had been my sister
’s , because of the hormones , dopamine , connections and
whatever else that had resulted from the changes- -even just thinking about that made me feel nauseous-
-and
my body had belonged to … nobody .   
Nobody and nothing .   
Not a single fucking soul had wanted it .   
Not me , not my family , not the hospital ,
not my sister- “
I think Capricorn would be down for it , but I ’m not sure about the others .
”
Maybe my sister had .   
Maybe it had n’t been an accident .
“
Ah , ” I said , trying to bring myself back to coherence .   
“
The others and fame ?
”
“
Yeah .
”
“
Swansong yes , for sure , ” I said .   
“ Tress .   
I do n’t know about our multi - trigger or Cryptid .
”
“ We need to bug our multi - trigger to come up with a name , ” Lookout said .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
I felt distinctly out of place , with the memories and the existential brink such a short distance behind me .   
“
I think there ’s potential .   
For rising in the ranks .   
I think I ’d be happy with it .
”
“ I have no interest in that , so if we get too much attention , we ’ll send the people your way , ” Fume Hood said .
I smiled .   
“
I do n’t think it works that way .
”
“ If-
”
She was cut off as Dragon ’s craft started up .   
Narwhal and Cinereal joined Dragon and Defiant on board .   
Weld , I saw , remained behind .
Another crisis , of the sort that was n’t announced or explained .   
Some of our best were out there now , trying to handle it .
And this- this series of attacks by Cheit .   
We had to handle it ourselves .
There was a rush of wind as the air blew downward and out , with the dragoncraft navigating a route through the foliage so it would n’t knock too many branches down .   
In the midst of it , it was hard to be heard , so I just signaled a goodbye to Tempera and Fume Hood .
“
You ’re pretty deep in thought , ” Lookout said .
“
Sorry .   
Talk with Defiant , then my parents
, thinking about our goals .
”
“
It ’s okay .   
I am too .   
I saw stuff on Dragon ’s ship that got me thinking .   
Are n’t Weld and Sveta cute ?
” I looked .   
They were leaning against a pair of trees that had grown together- or one tree that had grown apart , with a seam running through it .   
Weld had his arm around Sveta , who leaned against him , and the wind from the craft had blown her hair around .   
Some had blown into his face and around his chest and shoulders- some , it looked like , had gotten snagged .   
He did n’t react or brush it away like someone else
might , if they had hair across their face .
“ Super cute .
”
“ I want to find someone like that one day , ” she said .
Capricorn sat on a slab of stone that looked Tristan - created .   
Red armored , so it was Tristan in the armor right now , Byron as the observer .   
Cryptid was a few feet away , sitting on a seat that was much the same , but smaller .   
The coloring of the stone and the veins running through it made Cryptid easier to spot , as the camouflage extrapolated from the image of what he was sitting on and painted it up into his body , in fragments .
It was camouflage that would primarily work against someone who was n’t actively looking for trouble , and primarily in static , dull environments .   
In the city or the immediate vicinity of strange textures , it was n’t nearly as effective .
“
And there they are , ” Cryptid said .   
“
Did you steal
Dragon ’s notes ?
”
“
No ! ”
Lookout said .   
“
And I would n’t .   
She ’s nice .
”
“
She gives me a vibe like Legend and Valkyrie
do , ” Sveta said .
“ Good vibe or bad vibe ?
” Capricorn asked .
“ Bad .   
Sorry , ” Sveta said .
“
So powerful they ’re scary ?
” Capricorn asked .
“
No .   
I think if it was that , I could deal with it .   
I ’m scary ,
” Sveta ’s voice was quiet as she said it .   
“
But they give me this feeling , like they descend from the heavens and deign to deal with us mortals , right ?
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
I could see that .
”
“
But also … Legend was tied into the Cauldron thing .   
I had to get the full story from Weld , but it ’s why he left the Protectorate .   
He got caught .
”
“
He seemed remorseful , but I do n’t know if that ’s good enough .
”   
Weld was as serious as I ’d ever seen him .
“
Where I get paranoid is that I have to wonder if Valkyrie , Dragon and some of those others are for real .   
Why are they that strong ?   
What happened , and … if they ’re on that level , are they tied into it , like some of the other powerful people were ?   
Did they ignore stuff ?
”
“
It makes for an uncomfortable feeling , ” I said .
“
Yeah , ” she said .   
“
Sorry if I offended anyone , saying stuff about their favorite people .
”
There were a few heads that shook across our group .
“
I like them ,
” Lookout said , “ But I ’m not offended either .
”
“ I think if I had a chance to get to know her and reassure myself on things , it would n’t be so bad .   
But she ’s kind of … distant .
”
“
Less distant for me , I think , because she ’s apparently dating the Protectorate team leader from back when I was in Brockton Bay , ” I said .
“ Prettty much the same for me , ” Weld said .
“
Yeah , ” Sveta said .   
She smiled .   
“ I get that .
”
“ I do n’t like her ,
” Cryptid ’s voice was almost a mumble but not quite .   
It was n’t until I saw him lower his hand that I realized he ’d had his fingers in his mouth- maybe adjusting his braces .   
“
But I think I ’m different from you , Svet .   
I get the vibe that the more we knew about her , the less we ’d like her .
”
“
Well , ” Lookout said .   
“
That ’s screwed up , but that ’s okay , because you ’re screwed up .
” Chris scoffed .   
“ Thank you for respecting my opinions .
”
“ I might respect them if you justified them , except Dragon is cool and there ’s no justification for thinking otherwise , ” Lookout said .
“
No infighting , ” Capricorn said .
“
Okay , ” Lookout said .
“
Let ’s change the topic .   
Before Antares and Lookout arrived , we were talking jurisdictions , ” Capricorn said .   
He leaned forward , elbows on his knees .   
“ Remember when you were talking about your rationale for making Cedar Point our focus , Victoria ?
”
“
I remember , ” I said .   
“ High villain population , not covered in any existing jurisdictions , it slipped the net .   
Plus they flaunted their villainous independence from things .   
That kind of pissed me off .
”
“
Cedar Point is mostly okay now though , ”
Lookout said .   
“
I peek in now and again using cameras I set up a good while back .
”
“
Mostly okay ,
” Capricorn said .   
“
But there were other places that were up for consideration , and I get the feeling some more have sprung up since .
”
“ They have , ” Weld said .
“
Teams have other focuses , ” I said .   
“ The gaps are getting wider .   
It does n’t help that the portals blew up like they did .   
A lot of key sites fell apart .   
Places where a team like Foresight might have headquartered are gone or hard to use .   
It means crime is up , there ’s more distractions , and there ’s a lot more places for people like Cheit ’s groups to hide without leaving the megalopolis .
”
“ What are you thinking ?
” Capricorn asked .   
“ An agreement ?   
That we all take territory and commit to keeping the streets clean of crime there ?
”
“
No , ” I said .   
“
I ’m thinking … more comprehensive than that .
”
“ Comprehensive how ?
”
Weld asked in a voice that was deep , the tone serious to the point of concern .
“
Comprehensive … like jurisdiction .   
Why do we fight over it ?   
We do n’t want to be crowded out or to let others take credit for our successes .   
Very often our territories are close to home , so there ’s a personal element .   
If there ’s crime and we want our people to stay safe , we want to rid that area of crime .   
Financially , it ’s easier to hero in some areas than others .
”
“
Sure , ” Capricorn said .
“ I think so long as those issues exist , no matter what we do , there ’ll be pushing , shoving , and trying to get people to take some cases or to get others for ourselves .   
If we can address those issues … say we all get a special allotment , we put funds into a pot and apportion it out , and we organize , with communication and sharing of information .
”
“ I can do the getting and sharing information parts , ” Lookout said .
“
And , ” I said .   
“ Keeping in mind
this whole Cheit thing is demanding attention and resources while they ’re doing other things in the background-
it potentially addresses some of the other heroing issues we run into .   
Like how hard it can be to go run off and do something where we ’re needed when things can be going to pieces on the home front .
”
“
Meaning we can go investigate this group that attacked the portals while still maintaining a territory , ” Capricorn said .
“ Or investigate whatever .   
Yes , for sure , ” I said .   
“
And then a week later , we might babysit another territory while simultaneously giving the team in charge there a new , fresh set of eyes for any ongoing problems , while they do their thing .
”
“
Have you been thinking about this for a while ?
” Weld asked .
“ Only since talking to Defiant .   
I ’m talking out loud as I think about it .
”
“
And you want to take over where the Wardens left off ?
” he asked .
“ Not taking over , and not doing what they did , ” I said .   
“ They’re-
you ’re , if you want , you ’re still a fixture .   
But the Wardens were always focused on the top - level threats .   
Distant wars .   
Class - S stuff .
”
“ Ogun , ” Weld said .   
“ Sleeper .   
Machine Army .   
And a bunch of other things I ca n’t even namedrop , because they ’re classified .
” I nodded , my arms folded .
“
I ’d have to ask , ” Capricorn ventured .   
“
Let ’s say we did this , and magically everyone was on board .
”
“ We would n’t need everyone , ” I said .
“
Even so .   
We ’d need enough , since it ’s …
” he struggled for a moment .
“
The more you have , the more effective it works in aggregate , ” Weld said .
“
Yeah , ” Capricorn said .   
His mouth moved with a smile , barely visible with the gaps in his mask .   
“
Thanks .
” I tilted my head .   
“
What are you asking ?
”
“
What ’s our role in it ?
”
“ Nothing too special , ” I said .   
“
Except that people were already talking to us and communicating about collaborating .   
They wanted a chance at doing their part in Hollow Point .   
Let
’s …
I do n’t know .   
We ’d coordinate until things were coordinated .   
Let ’s learn from our mistakes , and make every territory into a Hollow Point .   
Make it so the bad guys do n’t know who ’s going to show up on a given day .   
And because we have other focuses and bigger priorities , we offer leniency if they help us with the things that matter .
”
“ Cheit , ” Sveta said .
“
The Fallen , ” Capricorn said .   
“
They ’re not all gone , Defiant said .
”
“ Or any other big group that ’s a problem
, ” I said .
I saw them considering .
“
It ’s a tall order , ” Capricorn said .
My motivations were n’t pure .   
My mom and the conversation with Tempera and Fume Hood had me thinking about why I did this stuff .   
Why I did the hero thing .   
She was a little ways away , having a conversation with Natalie at the very edge of the parkland clearing .
There were other things too .   
I wanted information .   
I missed having resources and we could n’t lean wholly on an eleven year old girl with a bad family situation to tackle it .
“
I know someone from the library who might know how to set up a database , ” I said .
“ I- ” Lookout said .
“ A mundane one , that does n’t require tinker maintenance .   
It ’ll last longer .   
You-
you ’ve got something amazing with the time camera , and you wanted to be more frontline .
”
“
Yeah , ” she said .   
She gave me a frenetic nod , helmet bobbing .
“ I do n’t think we can or should chuck you into a fistfight with a cape , but … we can get you closer to what ’s going on , test the waters , and we can only do that if you ’re not maintaining databases .   
Breakthrough has something solid with a pretty strong set of powers , and good group cohesion in a fight .   
Let ’s start building an infrastructure that we can lean on .
”
“ It would need refining , ” Capricorn said .
“
For sure .   
We can sleep on it – but we ca n’t wait for too long , ”
I said .
“
No , you ’re right .   
I do n’t think we can afford to wait too long before doing something big to try to fix these big problems , ” Capricorn said .
“
And , ” I said .   
I paused for effect .   
“
Defiant gave the a - ok .   
They ’ll talk to the prison-
”
“
Yes ! ”
Lookout shouted .
“ We can go in as a group- ” “ Yesss !
”
A cloaked Cryptid covered her mouth .   
“
Let her finish . ”








The wind had reached inside the apartment space , blowing papers through the room and across the floor .   
A window had been left cracked open , and the combination of persistent wind and a few days of us being away had added up to a fair bit of mess .
We had n’t left anything too vital behind , nothing too identifying on papers , no computers , nothing that would hurt if stolen .   
Some of the basics had been left behind , as had a lot of the detritus .   
Some were things like the snacks for when we patrolled or camped out in headquarters , loose papers and an assortment of tinker notes , Sveta drawings , and what seemed to be Chris’ notes for a game he was playing or designing .   
The whiteboards had been wiped down , but some had been wiped more meticulously than others , and traces of letters remained here and there .   
Sveta ’s still had fragments of the individual pieces of art .   
Ashley ’s had n’t been wiped clean at all .   
‘ Swansong’ still stood out on it .
I bent down and picked up one sheet of paper , which looked remarkably like an instant message conversation- one line on the top left , a line just below it and aligned to the far right .   
The left column had a spiral drawn above it .   
The right a teardrop .
note to self
: owe 45 m and thank - you treat to 

awesome brother suck up seriously what do you want ?   
we time share a body
and I 
 have no idea
what sort of thing you like .
think about it 
 and write something down when I pass control 
 $ 50 max .   
I have cash from work on construction block dunno .
clothes ?
clothes are expensive 

something in my style proposal : I get you two somethings not totally your 
 style but maybe broaden your horizons
I like my horizons where they are 
 hoodie
/ v.neck tee / straight - leg jeans 
 no big graphics .
dark colors if any color at all 
 or do n’t worry about it .
if it ’s a hassle 
 do n’t sweat it
The conversation terminated there .   
No reply from Tristan .   
No indication if they ’d found equilibrium or if the gift had been given .
The long plastic tables with the legs that folded down were still in place .   
I rolled up my sleeve , hesitated , and then undid my sling , ducking my head to get the strap over it and off .   
I would n’t do anything more strenuous than what I was doing in the physical therapy sessions .
Both sleeves rolled up , I began gathering papers .   
When repeatedly bending down got to be a pain , I used flight to dip and move along the length of the floor , gathering with one hand and holding them with the other .
Everything in order .   
There was a process , and I could follow steps and make things better .   
It was meditative , even .   
I did n’t mind that there were parts that were mind - numbing or dull .
The landlord had sent an email , asking if we were staying and asking us to either check and see that the place was intact or let her know
so she could stop in .   
With it being a hero headquarters of sorts , temporary or no , I ’d decided it was better to err on the side of caution .   
Easiest for me to stop in , considering how much easier it was for me to travel around the city .
I had originally planned to simply stop in and check that the place was intact .
Now I found myself staying .   
Fifteen minutes of tidying became thirty .   
After another fifteen minutes , I dug into the snacks , getting a drink and a small bite to eat .
Food not from our Earth .   
An unfamiliar variety of trail mix gathered together by something like honey and some preservatives , packaged in waxy paper rather than plastic .   
It was supposed to be in bars , but it crumbled so much that I ended up eating more of it by tipping the open bag into my mouth to let the broken - off bits fall in , than actually eating any bar .
This was where we were at .
This is how things are now .
We were n’t in a position to fight against a dedicated , serious enemy that wanted to dismantle us .    
The foundations our buildings were built on were n’t as solid as they should be .   
Our infrastructure was stretched thin , and a lot of it had been built with things given by other worlds .   
Things that had strings attached .
Clothes , appliances , even things as simple as screws were coming from elsewhere .   
We ’d been desperate to set ourselves up and get back to a semblance of normal ; it was to the point that a lot of things that looked like Earth Gimel things with the inevitable shortcuts and changes made were actually foreign products .   
Not Gimel , not Bet .   
The clues were subtle .   
The font had weird serifs on it , the layout of things like ingredients and the absence of nutrition info , the lack of anything like trademark or copyright symbols by brand names-
It was n’t ours .
Now relations with other worlds were tense .   
Some remained allies , but the construction workers’ riots , Cheit in general , and the sheer mess of this portal disaster were taking their toll .
I picked up some papers that had blown against the wall and beneath a table .   
Kenzie ’s homework , with doodles all over it .   
She was experimenting with art styles on her English homework .   
An apple in the top corner , realistic and shaded , with ‘ apple for teacher’ written beneath it .   
A lot of disembodied heads littered the page , drawn in an art style that consisted of circular heads with details and hair drawn on .   
‘ T.soup’ praised the drawing of the apple .   
‘ Maxtag’ suggested asking Sveta for tips .   
Another , unnamed one at the bottom
right told her to start over on a fresh page , because the current one was a mess .
I put it on Kenzie ’s table with other papers and weighed it down with a small hammer .
After another fifteen minutes of work , I got my laptop and put it on the table at my station .   
Once it booted up , it took a while to connect to the internet- long enough for me to sweep the entire floor .
No disasters so far today .   
No major fighting , the blackout and phone connectivity tracker was already up , and there were n’t any fresh outages .
I left it on in the background , music playing , while I resumed work , so the group could have its fresh start if and when we resumed working out of this headquarters .   
My work was punctuated by my searches online .
I paused to stop and check my arm .   
The muscle twinged .   
I ’d go easier , I decided .
Trash collected from the small bins and put away , stray boxes returned to where they belonged .   
Rain had left us a few stray pieces of traps , and blades both with and without handles .   
I left those where they were , because a tinker ’s
stuff was sacrosanct , even if it did n’t look like tinkerings .
Though I ’d have to touch it anyway .   
Odds were slim that he ’d be the one to turn up here and collect it .
I was wiping surfaces clean of dust when I heard heavy steps on the fire escape .
I flew , heading first to the ceiling , my sudden movement stirring some of the thin snakes of damp dust and hair that I ’d been wiping away .   
From the ceiling , I headed to the space above the door .
The footsteps were quieter as the person reached the top .
“ Hello ?
” he called out .
“ Tristan , ” I said .   
I dropped down to the floor .
He pushed the door open .   
He wore his costume top , helmet , and jeans .   
He had his usual rugged gym bag with him , heavy with his costume stuff .
“
Yeah , ” he said .   
“
I saw the door open and thought maybe someone broke in .   
You got the email from the landlord ?
”
“
Yeah .
”
“ I was n’t sure if it was only me .   
Huh .   
You beat me to it .
”
“ I fly , ” I said .   
“ Tactical and logistics advantages .
”
“
And I ’m jealous ,
” he said .   
He stepped inside , pulling off his helmet , then looked around .   
“
I was thinking I ’d sweep or something , but I guess I made the trip for nothing .
”
“ I did send out emails , trying to set the plan .
”
“ Outages .   
My ulterior motive was that I wanted to come here and see if the internet and phones were working .   
Besides , it seemed like the thing to do .   
If we ca n’t communicate with anyone else , we should go to the nearest rendezvous point .
”
“ Until Lookout gets us some means of communicating reliably , ” I said .   
I remembered the conversation .
“
Yeah .
”
He put his bag down .   
He was n’t gentle , and I could feel the weight of it settling through the floor .
I walked over to my computer and turned the music down .
“
You can leave it on if you want .   
What is that ?
”
“ Oldies rock , ” I said .
“ Oldies , huh ?   
Where ’s the line drawn for that ?
”
“ Before we were born , I think .   
A lot of what I listen to is from a decade before that .
”
“ Ahhhh , ” he said , like it was a big revelation .   
He walked over to his table and whiteboard , paging through the papers he ’d left behind .   
The conversation with Byron was among it .   
“ From the days before powers .
”
I frowned a little .   
“
I had n’t wanted to make it about powers .
”
“ I ruined it for you .
”
“
No , not ruined , ” I said .   
“
It ’s more-
”
“
It ’s hard to get away from , is n’t it ?
” he asked .   
He did what he could to fix his hair , where the helmet had pressed it down .   
As simple as the action was , there was something very serious in his eyes and his voice as his hands worked .   
“
It saturates everything .   
Our team , we get it more than a lot of others , I think .   
Other teams , maybe they have one or two members who really feel the weight of powers the way we do .
”
I thought about it .   
“ Different ways , for different members of our group .
”
Fingers worked to twist locks of hair into the rolling curls .   
He still had n’t painted his hair again .   
“
You ’re an outside case , but I think you qualify , you ’re even an expert on the matter .   
Sveta ’s been like
she ’s been for … five years ?
”
“
About .
”
“ Ashley dealt with her hands from the time she was thirteen to the time she was a little older than twenty .   
Two years spent being dead , clock turned back a bit , fuzziness from not being her original self … still .   
Eight or nine years at most ?
” I shrugged .
“
Byron and I trigger , endure a few years of this .   
Kenzie triggers really young , same principle , though , and she does n’t have that many years under her belt .   
Rain triggered later than most of us , but he ’s very , very similar to you , I think .   
He grew up within arm
’s reach of powers .   
Not so direct as you , but
… there .
”
“
Yeah .
”
“ You lived it .   
From birth , your mom was a hero and that was normal .   
Your dad .
”
“
My aunt , my uncle , my cousins .   
My boyfriend , friends , afterschool activities , hopes , dreams , field of study , the meals I ate .   
Over a thousand nights spent acutely aware that one of my parents was out there , and they might not come home .
”
“ How do you avoid drowning in it ?
” Tristan asked .
“
If you ’d asked me before ?   
I ’d have said they were natural waters for me .   
I did n’t drown because I breathed it .
”
“
And now ?
” I shook my head .   
“
I think I could still breathe it , live it , if it was n’t for- ” For the wretch .
“
For ?
” he prodded .
“
Things I need to figure out .   
One personal , and a bunch of external ones .   
People , forces , trends .   
I feel like I might be drowning , but it ’s because of others making the waters choppier .   
Pushing me under , even .
”
“ Tattletale ?
” he asked .
“
That was a fast reply .
”
“
An accurate one , ” his voice was smug .
“
Yeah .   
People like Tattletale .   
Do n’t get me wrong , I have my own stuff to deal with , and I ’ll figure that out with my therapist .   
But I really want to handle or get away from the people who are making life way more fucking difficult than it needs to be .   
Get some control over things , so they stop getting in the way .
”
“
Sounds like a plan , ” Capricorn said .   
“
This strategy of yours .   
Uniting the teams .   
Is that you handling things like you just described ?
”
“
Yeah .   
Some .   
Is that a problem ?
”
“ Nah , ” he said .   
He smiled .   
“
Nah , it makes sense .   
Assess the problem , get the resources together to address that problem .   
More contacts is good .   
More resources is good .
” I nodded .   
“
You brought this up for a reason .   
How hard it is to escape , the power stuff .
”
“
Yeah , ” he said .   
“
Nothing big .   
Tired of swimming , always on the cusp of drowning .   
Ca n’t get away from my situation .   
Rain was a friend and we ’re going to see him later , but he ’s gone .   
Sveta- ca n’t complain to her .   
It ’s like bitching about a cut finger when your friend is inside a blender .
”
“ I think she ’d listen and understand , ” I said .
“
I have days where I ca n’t do it anymore .   
No energy to keep fighting and pushing forward .   
Byron worries about me then , you know ?   
But that ’s not the hard part .   
It ’s that all the time , I ’m also watching Byron , worrying about him .   
Got ta keep an eye out , try to analyze , figure him out , make sure I ’m not being too hard on him when he ’s having a bad day .
”
“
It ’s good ,
” I said .
“
But I was never good at understanding him .   
I want the days we fight tooth and nail and fuck with each other .   
I know they ’re bad , duh
but that ’s so easy .   
This is what drains me .   
We ’re not fighting each other , and how do you fight onward if you ’re not revved up and ready ?
”
“ You find external focuses .   
Other enemies to fight .   
Line them up , knock them down , vent off steam that way .
”
He created what had to be his fourth top , setting it to spinning .   
It was more balanced than the others , but it had some wobble .
“ I miss kissing boys , ” he said .   
“
I saw a guy with a beard on my way here .   
He was n’t my type at all , but it hit me pretty fucking hard , that I ’ve never kissed a guy with a beard , and I might never .
”
“
Never is a pretty ridiculous word when we live in a world with powers .
”
He snorted loudly .   
Then sniffed , hard , blinking fast once or twice .   
“
You ’re Sveta ’s friend , for sure .
”
“
Yeah .
”
“ She likes to hold out hope .   
There ’s hope , there ’s always hope .   
But that does n’t do any good , does it ?   
I ’m trying to get through the now , and you two are telling me what the future has in store .   
My boat ’s sinking because there ’s a big gaping hole in it , and every time I ask for help , my friends say , ‘ If you get to shore , there ’s an awesome party with great booze , music , and dancing’ .
”
“
What I ’m
saying- what Sveta ’s no doubt
saying , is do n’t stop bailing out the boat because you ’ve lost sight of that shore .
”
“
I lost sight of shore a while back .   
I dream of it , but I dunno .   
One of the coolest night of my pre - cape life , I was teenager , went to a birthday party and it was boys and girls , big house , mostly unsupervised .   
Someone had the bright idea of playing strip poker .   
We did n’t get that far before everyone started chickening out and panic - squabbling over rules details until it was n’t fun anymore , but … that energy , before it went to pieces .   
You know ?   
The people , wondering if it ’s going to be the best night of your life or the night you fuck up
so bad you wince about it for years ?   
It ’s stuff like that .   
Jumping off the roof of a house into the pool below and having everyone cheer .
”
“
I can see it , ” I said .   
“
I think my equivalent is different .   
The cheering I get , I think .   
Validation .
”
“
I ’m not
sure I ’m chasing that anymore , and that ’s my identity , or it was .   
I ’m not
sure I ’m bailing out the sinking ship anymore .   
If I ca n’t figure out those things , then I ’m not sure it matters whether there ’s a shore or not .
”
“ Pretty dark place to be , ” I said .
“
Oh yeah ,
” he said .   
“
And I wish I had a not - Case-53 Weld of my own to lean on or help me bail out the boat , but I do n’t .
”
“ Shit , ” I said .   
“
I most definitely hear you on that .
”
He smiled .
“
I ’m not six feet tall , broad shouldered , or all that muscular , but if you want to hammer this stuff
out- ” “ Nah , ” he said , dismissing me .
“
Seriously , Tristan .   
Listening ear , time .   
I ’m not sure I have it in me to dredge up the time I could n’t bail out ,
see shore , or even … whatever it is .   
Remembering the good days .   
But if you need me to , if you want to tackle this like our team tackles the bad guys , I can try .
”
“ Do n’t .   
No , ” he said .   
“
Because if you tackle this like this team handled the last few things , two - sevenths of you will be gone by the time you ’re done .
”
“
That sounds about right if I have to do any dredging .   
But the offer stands .
”
“ Nah , ” he said .   
“
No need .   
You ’re looking after the kids , right ?   
Checking on Chris , you checked on Kenz .
” I nodded .
“
And that was important to do .   
You ’ll check on the others .
”
“
Probably .
”
“
Focus on them .
”
“
A lot of what you were saying sounded like a cry for help , Tristan .   
Especially toward the end .
”
“
It ’s not , not exactly .   
It’s- I ca n’t talk to Byron , because the two of us ca n’t be in the same room at the same time .   
My parents do n’t like talking to me .   
Not since the murder charge .   
I ’m limited in the friends
I can talk to , with one being worse off and one in prison .   
I needed to vent
and I needed to say it out loud and make sense of it .
”
I frowned at him .
“ For the record .   
This is coming from three places , ” he said .   
“ Beard guy I saw on the way over .   
That ’s a bit of it .   
Sveta was asking me for boy advice , that was the second .   
So you know , look out , because that ’s probably coming .
”
I frowned more , but mostly because Sveta had asked Tristan first , and not me .   
I could set that aside because Tristan was wrangling something .
“
And the third part , which actually got me thinking about this in the bigger sense … that whole thing about how powers are hard to get away from ? ”
“
Yeah .
”
“
Yeah .   
That ’s our group , but when I was trying to figure out who we might be seeing at the prison , the mentality we were working with or around , what to look out for … is n’t that it ?   
They ca n’t get away from their powers or what their powers have done to their lives .
”
He grabbed the latest spinning top he ’d fashioned with his power , caught it between fingertip and thumb , and crushed    with an ease that suggested his superpower was n’t even needed .
⊙ “ I can turn into a monster that ’s ninety percent mouth .   
I could do it now .
”
“ Do n’t , ” Capricorn said .
“ Or a form that ’s all slimy tentacles .
”
“
No , ” Capricorn said .
“
I just do n’t see why it matters what ’s in my pockets .
”
“ I do n’t see why you did n’t just leave it at home , ” Lookout said .
“
Because , ” Cryptid said , “ I need a bunch of this stuff .   
There ’s a good chance it matters .   
And because it matters , I do n’t need glorified security guards tampering with it .
”
“
You could put it in the locker , ” Sveta suggested .   
“
Two of us can move fast .   
If there ’s an emergency , we could go get it .
”
Discussion continued .   
I waited , my eyes roving over the surroundings .   
The entryway to the jail was built of the same prefabricated segments , with the arching ceiling over the booth , the layout of the hallways , and the setup around the door .   
The difference was in the protective measures .   
The entryway looked like a place that was triply fortified , with shutters that could drop down at regular intervals , and a very fortified booth .   
Painted lines traced along the floor , pointing to different destinations .
“
I ’ll keep some of the essential stuff , ” Cryptid said .   
“
If I end up unconscious for any reason , if I look dead , if I ’m dying , something vital plops out of my chest , just stab me with these .   
If you can get me conscious again , I ’ll figure out the next steps myself .
”
They looked like the epipen needles and the adrenaline - shot needles that came in the mass - produced first aid kits .   
He had three of them , and he walked over to the desk to show the guards .
We were in costume .   
Cryptid was n’t cloaked , because cloaks would have been concerning , but instead had decorated himself in a look that was shadowy , crocodile - like scaling .   
The light and shadow that hit him affected him in a different , odd way , with deeper shadow and slimmer bands of light .
He ended up having to hand over the cloaking device , too .   
He turned his head away from both guards and security cameras .
“ You do n’t need to worry , ” one of the guards said .   
“
We ’re law enforcement .   
We ’re on the same side .
”
“ I prefer to play it safe , ” Chris -not Cryptid for the moment- replied .
“ If we did n’t have this recommendation letter , your attitude here might mean we ’d turn you away .
”
“
But you have it , right ?
”
“
Cryptid , ” Capricorn said .   
“ Go easy .
”
“ I am , believe it or not , ” Cryptid said .   
He took the cloaking device as it was slid back in his direction , and snatched up the syringes when they were passed his way .   
“
I ’m here because it ’s my duty to a friend .   
I hate institutions .
”
“ You live in one , ” Lookout said .
“
Barely .   
It ’s a place with a bed and we have a nice agreement where they do n’t make me follow rules and
I do n’t bother anyone too bad .   
I do n’t see why it matters what I have on me , when we ’re capes .
”
As much as Cryptid was complaining to us , but the guys at the desk overheard .   
One said , “ The question is what you might slip to them , not what you do yourself .
”
“ They have powers .   
What tool are we going to hand over that would trump that ?
”
“ Do n’t know , do n’t care , ” the guy at the desk said .
I was given the all - clear .   
I fixed my bag over my shoulder –
my arm was back in the sling , so the management of the bag was made more difficult .   
The contents had been confirmed safe .   
I ’d have to use their supplied cord for my laptop , since they ’d taken the battery , but that was fine .   
At least it lightened my load by a pound or so .
“
Keep a safe distance from all prisoners in the area , ” the instructions came from the desk .   
The first shutter between us and the yard was opened .   
“ Limit hugging or touching to once at the start of the visit and once at the end .
”
“ Aww .
”
“ You may sit at the same table , but nothing may cross that table while you ’re there .   
The breadth of the table should be kept clear .   
You will not agitate the prisoners , whether the ones you are visiting or the ones who may be observing .   
Some others will be out exercising , but they wo n’t be allowed to approach within three hundred feet .
”
“
Got it , ” Capricorn said , with a rush to his voice that , in another context , might have suggested he was in a hurry and he wanted the guard to stop talking .
In reality , he was probably trying to get an answer in before Chris said anything ill - advised .
“ Do n’t wander off , ” the guard said .   
“
Stay within ten feet of one another .   
If there is an emergency- ”
“ If there ’s an emergency , we ’re capes , Cryptid said .
“ If there is an emergency , you ’ll return here .   
Failing that , enter any non - residential building .   
There will be two near where you are seated .   
You ’ll be free to seal and shutter the entrances .
”
It was such a messy prison system .   
A minimum of guards , the prisoners free range , without even a wall between them at the outside world .   
It was just … flat and marshy out in three of the four directions , with the fourth not being fantastic .   
Everything hinged on the ankle - worn bombs and other countermeasures that the prisoners wore .   
To run meant to have one ’s foot and calf blown off .
The shutter down the hall opened .
“ You may proceed straight ahead .   
The prisoners you ’ve asked to meet will be on their way to the table shortly .
”
The light from outside was bright as the shutter came up .   
Wind blew through as the shutter raised , but it was n’t because of the distorted portals and weather from that .   
We were too far off the beaten track , and things were more tranquil here .
Buildings were set down in tight clusters , for administration buildings , or in nondescript collections of apartments , fitting within the narrowest possible interpretation of code and then cramming that full of one - room apartments .
One set of a dozen prisoners were filtering into the buildings .   
Our visit had been timed by the prison to take advantage of the shift to the next exercise period .
I saw three or four of the Fallen capes in the mix .   
Complicated .   
They were some of the ones who had been in the background during the raid on the camp , periodically using their powers .   
If they were here , they were diehard enough to be deemed irredeemable .   
Most of the others had either expressed genuine remorse or they ’d feigned it well enough to convince a judge .
If they were here , they were the kind of Fallen who were unquestionable problems .
I was glad that most seemed to be going inside .   
Some found seats by windows , where they could stare us down .
I spotted Rain , who approached from the other half of the complex , passing through a corrugated metal gate that a guard managed , and approached us at the table .
The table was longer and wider than what I was used to , and so were many of the other parts of the area –
the buildings were squat and heavy , with a lot of fortification .   
Roads were wide enough that four cars could pass down them side by side .
The large fixtures and the wide , broad planes of everything coupled with the isolated individuals to make the entire space out to look exceedingly isolated .
Rain took his seat .   
He ’d trimmed his hair short , and with no hair in the way or covering anything up , his eyes were open wider , no longer shielded or half - closed in readiness to blink as hair fell over them , and a multitude of tiny nicks and cuts covered his face .   
There were places where the scars left a tiny notch in his jawline or ear .   
The lines of his hands and the half - moons of his fingernails were black with oil .   
He wore a prison - issue denim coat over his regular clothes .
At least he had that luxury .
“
Hi , ” Lookout said .
“
Hey critter , ” he said .   
“
I heard about some of your adventures a few days ago .
”
“
All good now .   
Things are mostly the way they were , except I do n’t see my parents outside of the courtroom .   
It ’s nice .   
More peaceful , with more people to talk to .
”
Rain nodded .   
“
Peaceful , yeah .   
Same , except for the whole imprisonment part .   
Boredom so bad you might imagine you ’d do something stupid .   
Some do- and
I ’d join them if I did n’t have the realty check every night .   
The days do n’t seem to end .
”
“
We brought gifts , ” Sveta said .   
“
Things to read .   
The guards will bring it to you later .   
I hope that helps with the boredom .
” Rain smiled .   
“
That ’s perfect .   
I ’ll probably end up reading each one twenty times .
”
“
Have you heard from Erin ?
”
Lookout asked .
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .   
“
She dropped by yesterday .   
She ’s splitting her attention between me , her family issues , and Lachlan Hund .
”
“
The brainwashed teenager , ” I said .
“
So apparently when I ran off the night before the attack , going to March to try to break the connection to Mama , Erin was given some options .   
One of those options was that she marry Lachlan .
”
“
Oh no ! ”
Lookout said .
“
They ’re both really nice , attractive people , ” Rain said .   
His expression was grim .   
“ Front - facing people to recruit others .   
They could become celebrities without any issue .   
I can see the logic
”
“
Yeah , ” Sveta said .   
“ Logic , except , the brainwashing , the forced marriage , all that .
”
“ Mmm , ” Rain grunted .   
“
It ’s an awkward thing , her helping him and him being a go - between for her and her family- who are n’t dealing well with the family mostly shattering .   
She might be by later .
” I noticed mostly because Lookout was bouncing in her seat , but Ashley was in view now .    
Double - vision .   
There were two of her , wearing similar dresses .   
The one slightly in the lead was our Ashley , our Swansong , with hair cut short .   
It had fanned out slightly at the bottom , and where weight had pulled it straight , it had a bit of a twist to it .   
Her bangs were similar , but more twisty , pushed over to one side .
Our Ashley ’s hands were intact .   
Her darker self had knife - hands .
“
So cool , ” Lookout said .
Rain leaned forward , touching the intercom at the middle of the wide table .   
“
Can the other Ashley Stillons join us ?
”
“
Checking , ” came the reply .
I was aware of the eyes on us .   
The visitor seating table was about a hundred feet down from the main office .   
Some chicken - wire fence separated sections of the greater infrastructure , but little effort had been made to make it tall or make it private .
I might ’ve seen one or two more fallen , as I surreptitiously glanced around .   
I got my notebook out and began scribbling down notes as best as I could with only one arm free .   
People , places .   
Suspicious individuals .
Lookout bounced out of her seat , half - running- “
No running , careful ! ”
Sveta called out .
-and
half skipping .   
She slowed down at the warning .
Ashley pulled her into a hug .
“
How are the hands ?
”
Rain asked .
“ More functional , but the right is giving me jolts of pain .
”
“
Damn it , sorry , ” Rain said .   
“
Tonight ’s not a good night .   
We ’ll see about tomorrow ?
”
“ Okay , ” Ashley said .   
She set a hand atop Kenzie ’s head .   
“ If it gets bad , I can take it off .
”
“ Best not to , ” Rain said .
The intercom buzzed , but no voice came through .   
It took three or four seconds , and then there was only a “ Permission refused .
”
Too bad .   
It had been a long shot , to bring Swansong ’s sister in .
I looked at her , and I saw a reflection of Ashley , but one that casually wore the glares and haughty expressions that had been rarer or which had only emerged in times of stress .   
She stalked , eyes wide .
I was reminded of the Siberian , seeing her , what with the long pale hair across her face , the natural arrogance , and the dangerous look in her eyes .   
I did n’t see it in the Ashley that was hugging Lookout right now .
“
You ’re getting our emails , right ?
” Capricorn asked .
“
Yes , ” Rain said .   
“ Thanks to your testimony .   
Until we fuck up , we get some slack .   
You guys had ideas for a new team direction .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“ We did n’t want to decide on anything definite without consulting you guys .
”
“ I have questions ,
yeah ,
” Rain said .   
“
Like what does Capricorn Blue think ?
”
“
He ’s not protesting as hard as you might think , ” Capricorn said .   
“
We need to do something .
”
“
It ’s bad .   
The war , ” Sveta said .   
“
It ’s not one with battlefields , and we ’re not organized enough to win a war of information .
”
“ I like it , ” Ashley said .   
“
The thing about the group that never made sense was the insistence that Capricorn was a leader .
”
“
Hey .
”
“
But , ” she said .   
“
We have three leaders .   
Different styles .   
Different focuses .   
It fits for a group that ’s steering other teams to better places where the old did n’t fit us .
”
“ We ’re not taking over anything , ” I said .
She snorted .
“
No , really .
”
“ Capes take over .   
We take power because we have power .   
Just as those with money have a natural ability and desire to earn money .   
The healthy are inclined to stay healthy .
”
“ Capes are unhealthy by definition , ” Cryptid said .
“
There ’s room to maneuver in there , ” Capricorn said .   
“
Listen , Rain , Ash , are you two talking ?   
How easy is communication ?   
What other channels do you have open ?   
People here you talk to ?
”
“ I can do bi - weekly maintenance on Ashley ’s hands , we get internet , some freedom of movement , some access to tools .
”
“
More of a benefit to Rain than to me .   
But it ’s nice to be able to talk to him , at least , ” Ashley said .
“ Some people talk to housemates by standing on the balcony , ” Rain said .
“
My roommate is fine .   
Exceptionally beautiful and graceful , ” Ashley said .   
“
Good genes , I think .   
Clever .   
Quick to learn .   
Witty , even .
”
“ That joke is wearing thin , ” Sveta said .
“
I ’m not joking , ” Ashley replied .
“ I think it ’s a perfect assessment , ” Lookout said .   
“ I like our version better though .   
The hair looks amazing .
”
“
She ’s fine .   
There ’s a lot to catch up on .   
The others in the house- not good people .   
A big Asian woman who wo n’t tell me her cape name .   
She stonewalls me .   
Another woman who only whimpers and cries .   
She panicked months before we arrived .   
Tried to take off her ankle bracelet .   
Now she has a bracelet on the one ankle she has left .   
The last is a child killer .
”
“
What ? ”
Sveta asked .   
“
That ’s a thing ?
”
“
She went by Unicorn , but it was an inherited name .   
So she ’s Unicorn the fifth or something .
”
“ Unicorn four , ” I said .
“ Shit , yeah , ” Capricorn said .   
“
I heard about that one .   
It was on the news a decade ago .   
She was on the sponsored team ‘ Goldenrod’ .
”
“
She ’s Monokeros now , ” I said .   
“
Yeah .   
Stay away .
”
“ They send teams of two to escort her when they need her to do something , like visit the doctor , ” Ashley said .
“
Not much help then , ” Rain said .   
“
I ’ve talked with my housemates , a bit .   
They do n’t love me , but two sound like they ’d be willing to sell me info , if they see anything hinky .
”
“ If it ’s verifiable info , I can put money in their commissaries , ” Capricorn said .
“
Great , ” Rain said .   
“
We ’re looking at staff , mostly .
”
“ You ’ve already started then , ” Cryptid said .   
He looked over his shoulder .
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .   
“
Definitely .   
Helps with the monotony .
”
There were so many people watching from windows .   
Our investigation could n’t help but be conspicuous … and if it was staff that was interfering , then they had the benefit of access to surveillance , records , and any number of other means of tracking these patients .
Now that it struck me , we ’d have to figure out if a staff member could theoretically detonate the ankle bombs as a weapon , to control or remove problematic individuals .
I ’d ask when Rain and Ashley could n’t hear .   
It would n’t do to stress them out .
“ I found one person who stands out , ” Ashley said .   
“
It might be worth looking at them or having a chat .   
Or it might be a problem .   
You know them , Victoria .
”
Oh , no .   
Those were spooky words .








“ Crystalclear , ” Capricorn said .   
“
As employee , or-
”
“
No , ” Ashley said .   
“ Inmate .   
Rain was paying more attention to the employees .   
I was focused on …
” She paused .
“
The competition ?
” Capricorn tried .
“
The pecking order , ” was her reply .   
“
They limit contact , make us keep a certain distance from one another , but we cross paths and we see each other .
”
“
Not solitary , not segregated confinement , ” Cryptid said .   
He was standing by the picnic - style table with its broad top , rather than sitting .   
He spoke differently when he was in costume .
“
Kind of segregated , ” Rain said .
“
It used to be fully segregated , ” Ashley said .   
“
There are too many of us now .   
They ca n’t send each of us individually to go exercise and still give us enough exercise .
”
Rain put his elbows on the table , hands together , cracking his knuckles , before cocking his head to look at Ashley .   
“
I have n’t seen Crystalclear , and you did n’t mention him .
”
“
It was recent .   
The main yard is n’t that far from my place .   
You can see it from one of the windows .   
The boys go to their windows to look when the women exercise , and the women go to the window when boys exercise .   
I heard the jeering and went to look .   
He ’s recognizable from a distance .
”
“ I do n’t have a view of the yard from my place , ” Rain said .
“ You draw the shittiest hands in life , ” Cryptid said .
“ I guess .   
I ’m as red blooded as anyone , but I feel like I ’d watch for five minutes and then get bored .
”
“
Five minutes is long enough for most , ” Cryptid said .
“ Maybe for you , ” Tristan said .
I rolled my eyes .
Lookout looked from me to the boys .   
“
Oh .   
SO gross .
”
“
Yes , ” Ashley said , tilting her head Lookout ’s way in a conspiratorial way .   
“
Keep this in mind when you ’re older and interested in your first boys .
”
“
In my defense and in defense of my gender , I ’m not part of this , ” Rain said .   
“
This is those two .
”
“
It ’s standard teenager talk , ” Cryptid said .
“ Everything ’s fair game , so long as nobody ’s uncomfortable , ” Capricorn added .
“ Okay , ” Lookout said .
“
Um .   
Sorry , I ’m feeling a bit awkward .   
Can we just go back to talking shop ?
” Sveta asked .   
When eyes turned her way , she shrugged as best as she was able .
“
Okay , ” Cryptid said .   
“
Sure .
”
“
Thank you , ” Sveta said , “ Where were we ?   
Crystalclear ?
”
“ Crystalclear , ” Capricorn confirmed .   
“ From the good guy side in the community center attack .   
You ’ve talked to him , Victoria ?
”
“
Yeah .   
Fume Hood and Tempera did n’t mention him going to prison , ” I said .
“ Maybe they do n’t know , ” Ashley said .
“ Probable .   
He does n’t seem like the criminal type .
”
“ Spooky , that you never really know what your teammates are like , ” Sveta said .   
“
Do you think he ’d talk if you reached out ?
”
“
I can try , ” I said .
“ I thought he seemed out of place , he ’s a contact of yours , and from what little I saw , he was talking with others .   
A lot .   
That ’s not always easy , ” Ashley said .   
“ Guards were n’t really pulling him away , I think because he ’s got a past record as a hero .   
He seemed like a good person to ask .
”
“ How does that work ?
”
Capricorn asked .   
“
Talking to others .   
There ’s talking across the balconies , right ? ”
“
At yard time , four buildings with sixteen people get out at the same times , ” Rain said .   
“
We get split up into areas .   
There ’s a weights cage , a basketball court with one hoop , two people allowed at a time , but you ca n’t play with someone if you ’ve had any altercations .
”
“
The basketball hoop is the Queen ’s court , ” Ashley said .   
“
Top woman on this side of the prison ,   Llorona , gets the court and nobody argues if they want to have a good stay .   
She invites different people every day .
”
“ Similar for the guys who get out around the same time I do , but they hog the court
, ” Rain said .   
“ Coalbelcher and his right hand man get the court every day .   
It ’s rare that someone else gets to go .   
You basically have to kill someone to earn enough respect to get in .
”
“ If you go that far you ’re never leaving , ” Capricorn said .   
“
Maybe they figure they might as well get to know you , if you ’re committing to being a lifer .
”
Rain snorted , a laugh without humor .
“ Court , weights , and
… ” I prompted .
“ And the main yard
, ” Rain said .   
“
There are a lot of rules for all of it .   
Weights cage , you get seven minutes at a time , have to clean up and reset the area as part of those seven minutes , or you do n’t get a turn for a week .   
You go from there to the yard , next person in the yard gets a turn .   
Court , you ca n’t have a record of altercations with other prisoners .   
Yard is where most go .
”
“ Most people run laps , ” Ashley said .   
“ You have to stay a set distance from others .   
If you do n’t , your ankle beeps until you get away .   
We ca n’t stand close to one another , but there ’s leeway if you ’re in the middle and doing something active .   
Some throw or kick balls .   
Talking happens while running thirty feet behind someone or playing catch .   
You ’re always far enough apart you have to raise your voice , and so you ca n’t conspire with anyone .
”
“
I ’m not really social , ” Rain said .   
“
I have n’t really tried , but it ’s hard enough to run that long and not look like a wuss .   
People try to lap you , too .   
They ’ll signal the guards , guards call out for you to stop in a corner and let them pass .
”
“ They do it on purpose , ” Ashley said .   
“
You get the people who run together , just close enough to not cause trouble , talking while they run , others try to lap people , shame them , show off their stamina , and the rest are either trying not to look bad or they give up and throw balls .
”
“
Sounds right , ” Rain said .
“
Can you talk to Crystalclear ?
” I asked .
“ You might have better luck than me .   
I have n’t seen him yet .   
They keep some buildings of people segregated from others .   
Like , they do n’t want Fallen in the same yard as me , you know ?
”
“ You have a better chance of ending up in the same yard with him than I do , ” Ashley said .
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .   
“
Sure .   
I mean , if the chance comes up , I ’ll try .
”
“
And I ’ll try on my end , ” I said .   
“
I ’m not sure if it ’ll ring alarm bells , me being too obstrusive , but I ’ll see what I can do .
”
Rain nodded , cracking his knuckles again .   
“
While you ’re at it ?   
Could you keep an eye on Cradle and Love Lost ?
”
“ We have been , ” Lookout said .
“ Cradle is in custody here , ” I explained .   
“
Other end of this complex .   
I was n’t able to check in for his meeting with the court processors , because I had physio .   
I would have skipped , but Capricorn had it .
”
“ I looked in , sat in the back , ” Capricorn said .   
“
It went by quick .   
He ’s been doing a lot of business , which is working against him now , because he ca n’t explain where his money came from , but he does n’t have many friends , either .   
Not while Tattletale is freezing him out .
”
“
She ’s staying out of it ?
”
Rain asked .
“
She ’s staying out of it , ” I confirmed .   
“ As far as we can tell .   
It ’s hard to know for sure with the masterminds .
”
“
Do you trust her ?
”
Ashley asked .   
“
Or will she try something ?
”
“
No , I do n’t trust her , ” I offered up half of a laugh to go with it .   
“
But I do believe her , I guess , when it comes to this .
”
“
That simplifies things , ” Sveta said .   
“
I do n’t think she ’d breach a contract , written or unwritten , if it ’d hurt her ability to do business .   
I believe her too .   
And I ’ve been on the same side as her , I guess .
” I nodded .
“
What about Love Lost ?
”
Rain asked .
“
She ’s hanging out with Nailbiter , Sidepiece , Disjoint and that group , ” Capricorn said .
“
Oh , my friends , ” Ashley said .
“ I think she ’s in charge , ” Lookout said .   
“
I do n’t know how that works , someone who ca n’t talk being a leader .
”
“
Keep an eye on her ?
”
Rain asked .   
“
She ’s stronger than she was .   
Cradle too .   
The bias of power shifts around a lot between our group .   
Since Snag ’s gone , it ’s … stormier .   
The pendulums swing further and harder .
”
“ We will , ” Capricorn said .
“
Scapegoat ’s here ,
Seir ’s here ,
” Rain heaved out a sigh as he said it .   
“
Valefor is in a hospital with one of these ankle bombs attached .   
Mama Mathers is … ”
“
Isolated , ” I said .   
“ Classified location , given the likelihood the Fallen would try to get her out .
”
“ I do n’t know why they would , ” Sveta said .   
“
She ruled by fear , everyone ’s finally free .
”
“ I think being controlled and managed , having that firm a hand on you , it ’s reassuring to some types , ” Rain said .   
“
Like how some people ca n’t handle it after they get out of prison .   
They no longer know how to be free .   
She ’s had control for a long time .
”
“
Creepy , ” Sveta said .
“ Definitely , ” Rain said .   
“
Just … keep me updated ?   
I feel so out of the loop , stuck in this weird prison - town , ghost - town setup , a universe away from you guys .
”
“
Three universes away , if you consider the number of steps you need to take to get here , ” Cryptid said .
“
Thanks , Chris .   
Thanks .   
That really helps with the weird disconnected , homesick feeling
I ’m
wrestling with .
”
“
I ’m sorry , Rain .   
We ’ll send a care package ,
okay ?
”
Lookout said .
“
Okay .   
Just to warn you , I think they ’re pretty careful about what they let me have , though , given how I ’m a tinker .   
They measure out all the materials I get and what goes into Ashey ’s hands .
”
“
Okay .   
Books should be okay , right ?   
And you ’re online , so we can message you ?
”
“
Yeah , but they look at everything we send , so … secret identities , and be aware our enemies could be getting the same info .
”
“
I ’ll message you , we ’ll catch you up , ” Capricorn said .
“ Cool , ” Rain said .   
“
Just keep me in the loop , and I think I can do this .   
Maybe .   
It ’s the boredom that ’s making me second
guess what I felt before , that I can ride out this entire sentence , whatever it winds up being .
”
“
I ’m patient , ” Ashley said .   
“
We ’ll entertain ourselves with our side of the investigation .   
I won over Llorona , I think .
”
“
The Queen of the basketball court ?
” Sveta asked .
“
Yes .   
Everyone meets with her , if they ’re here for a couple of weeks without incidents .   
She keeps the peace and smooths out wrinkles , so they let her .
”
“ I would have thought you ’d have to play a good game of basketball to win her over , ” Capricorn said , pausing while Ashley nodded .   
He added ,    “ And your hands are n’t working .
”
“
Yes .   
That ’s one way .   
And I ’ve never played basketball .   
I ’d lose if it came down to it .
”
“
Then how did you pull that off ?
”
Capricorn asked .
Ashley smiled .   
“ When she acted like she was better than me because I would n’t play , I tore my left hand off in front of her .
”
“ Awesome ! ”
Lookout reacted to the self - dismemberment with awe and glee , because of course she did .
“
That ’d do it , ” Cryptid , by contrast , was almost smug , even though he had n’t had anything to do with it .
“
I think she likes me now .
”
“ You do realize staff are watching you , and they report these kinds of things , right ? ”
Sveta asked .
“
Yes .   
I told them I needed maintenance , no sweat .
”
“
It was such a mess ,
” Rain was almost despondent in tone , contrasted with Lookout ’s excitement and Cryptid ’s satisfaction .   
“
I ’m the maintenance , you know .   
And there ’s blood with forced removals like that .   
Like , hurry , hurry , get dressed , shoes on , and run , because she might not live if it ’s not plugged in right .
”
“ Spooky , ” Sveta said .
“ Messy ! ”
Rain exclaimed , to Sveta .   
To Ashley , he said , very seriously , “ Messy .
”
“ Letting the Queen place me at the bottom of the totem pole would have been worse , ” Ashley said .   
“
It helps Rain , too .
”
“ Helps ?
”
Rain asked .
A buzzer sounded across the complex .
“ We ’ll talk about this later , ” Rain said .
“
Time ’s up ?
”
I asked .
I saw their nods .
“
Aww , what ?   
No .   
We just sat down , ” Lookout said .
“
Another time , ” Ashley said .
“ Keep an eye out for the care package , ” Lookout said .
“
It ’s not like I ’m going to be out when it arrives , ” Ashley said .   
She stood from the picnic table .
“ I was n’t sure what to do
but I thought books would be best , ” Lookout said .   
“
They were always something I went to when I could n’t sleep .   
I had stacks of them on my bed , piled high enough they could have tipped over and bruised me .   
I ’d sleep with my head on a book sometimes .
”
“ I do n’t think I ’m going to do that , ” Ashley said .   
“
But I ’ll read what you send me .   
C’mon .
”
Lookout went to her .   
They hugged .
The buzzer sounded again , more intense .   
Rain ’s anklet beeped once .
“ I should go , ” Rain said .   
“
They ’ll get pissy if we get in the way of schedules .
”
“
Yeah .   
I can stay , I think .   
It ’s my yard time , ” Ashley said .   
“
They ’ll let me know if it is n’t .
”
“
Then I ’m going to duck out , ” Rain said .
He clasped hands with Capricorn , then the handshake became a half - shake , half - hug thing .   
“
Keep us up to date on that team thing .
”
“
Yeah , ” Capricorn said .
We parted ways , our group heading back toward the gate , while Ashley walked on the other side of the road .
Guards were out , each with positions in mind .   
They fanned out , each armed and uniformed , their belts heavy with gear .   
For the most part , they were isolated
– one guard to a given location .   
There was one case where the guards moved in a group of three , with something of a determined cast to their features .
We were almost at the gate when Lookout took a hard right turn , striding away from the group .
“
What are you doing ?
”
I asked .
She was silent .
Something was wrong .   
I lifted off , but in that same moment , Sveta ’s arm went out , propelled by tendrils .   
She grabbed Lookout by the shoulder , stopping her in her tracks .
I was n’t the only one to look in the direction she ’d been going .
Off by one of the buildings , a woman with black hair and a few tattoos was leaning against the side of a building , camouflaged .   
She was a considerable distance away , to the point where I could n’t make out details of her face , tattoos , or outfit
– only a top with a ‘ v’ cut at the neck and a frilly flap that went from collar to shoulder , black pants , and shoes .
“ Monokeros ! ”
Ashley shouted the name .   
When she had Monokeros’ attention , she shook her head .
The woman laughed in response , audible even from a considerable distance .
The woman stepped away from the wall , thumbs hooked in pockets , and started walking away .   
We ’d been traveling north to south , and Monokeros had been a few hundred feet to our west .   
She walked north , which put her behind us and off to the side .
A non threat , supposedly .
Ashley stared , watching the woman as she left .
“
Fuck , ” Capricorn said .   
“
You okay , Lookout ?
”
“
It was like getting hit with Victoria ’s aura , but without the jittery oh - shit - ness of it , ” Lookout said .   
“ Purer , stronger .
”
I folded my arms , thumb hooked into sling .
“
I pretty much only ever get the jittery oh - shit part from Victoria , ” Capricorn said .
“ Same , ” Cryptid said .
“
I ’ll talk with her , ” Ashley said .   
Her expression was cold .   
“
She was testing me .   
That ca n’t stand .
”
“
Do n’t get yourself in more trouble , ” Sveta said .
“
She fucked with Lookout .
”
“ Stick with the rules , ” I said .   
“
Use the system against her .   
Report her , let them handle it and change their policies .
”
“
No , do n’t use the system , ” Lookout said .
We looked at her .
“ If you do , they ’ll say the easiest fix is to not let me come back .   
They ’ll say it ’s too dangerous to let kids come here , and then I wo n’t be able to see you .
”
“
They ’d punish her , not you , ” Sveta said .
“ They might punish me .
”
“
I ’m on the kid ’s side , ” Cryptid said .   
“
Institutions are dumb .
”
Ashley drew in a deep breath .   
Holy shit , she looked more pissed than she had with Beast of Burden .   
I could imagine the only thing that was stopping her was that her potential target was out of reach .
“
Leave it , ”
Lookout pleaded .   
“
It ’s fine .   
Please ?
”
“
I ’m not going to leave it , ”
Ashley ’s voice was quiet .   
“
But I wo n’t make it an incident .
”
“ Take care of yourself , ” I said .   
“ If you let her get to you , she wins .
”
“
It ’s fine , ” Ashley said .   
“
I ’m betting
she ’ll go back to her cell to hide , the coward .   
I ’m going to run , and I ’ll think for a while before doing anything .
”
“
Good plan , ”
I said .   
“ Except the doing part , I ’m worried .
”
“
It ’s fine , ” she replied , with a tone that suggested it was also final .
“
Okay , ” I said , glancing at the others .
“
I ’m
sorry things ended on that note , ” Ashley said .   
She set a hand on Kenzie ’s head .
“
Me too ,
” Lookout said .
“
Do n’t let this place get to you , ” Sveta said .   
“ Remember your goals .
”
“
Yeah .   
Always focused on the future , hm ?
” Ashley asked .
“
Exactly .   
Just get through today .
”
Ashley stepped back , like it took a measured effort to separate herself , then she smiled .   
With that , she left , heading back into the deeper prison , while leaving us to enter the gate .
Capricorn and Sveta each placed a hand on one of
Lookout ’s shoulders .   
I glanced at Cryptid , but I could n’t read the expression he wore ,
Lookout ’s
device masking his face .
There were people to keep tabs on , both enemies and on our side .
⊙ Our hideout was coming together .   
Kenzie ’s computers were hooked up , monitors and projected screens arranged .   
Whiteboards and desks were being moved around .   
Ashley ’s whiteboard with ‘ Swansong’ across the top in fancy script was now joined by ‘ Rain’ .   
The preliminary notes on what they needed and what they ’d found were going up on their shared board .
The board we ’d freed up listed the other teams , from the Wardens , the Guild , all the way down to the pairing of Fume Hood and Tempera .   
It stood at the back of the room , furthest from Kenzie ’s workstation .   
People we ’d rope in .
Kenzie ’s projectors started showing images from her camera feeds .   
A couple were from Cedar Point .   
The graffiti had been painted over in places , or had chipped away because some of the yellow paint they ’d co - opted and used had been meant to draw temporary lines for outlining buried power cabling or highlighting spots for danger , not to paint something in a way that lasted for weeks or months , across weather changes .
Tristan ’s laptop stalled as it loaded the page .   
I ’d stepped away to sort out whiteboard markers while it took its time , and now I approached again .   
He was wearing only the lower portion of his armor , the upper half just the under - armor part that prevented chafing .   
Sveta was beside him , hands clasped behind her back as she bent over to a degree that most would find untenable after a minute or so .
The page that had only loaded ninety percent of the way was a map with a list of crimes reported , as compiled and shared out by the police of the Megalopolis .   
Citizens managed it , apparently , listening in on the police scanners and putting in push - pin style markers on the map .
A slice of the map was gray , refusing to load in , but the overall situation was clear , especially as Tristan moved the slider .   
Petty crimes were up .   
People were cluing in that the heroes and the police did n’t have the authority or power to arrest everyone .
In Cedar Point , things were ‘ better’ .   
The vacancies were filling , as people relocated here from places nearer to the devastated portals , the villains were scattered with only a few lingering and not really conducting business .   
Even here , according to the map , there were burglaries , robberies , and concerned citizens reporting that they ’d seen drug deals or drug - related activity .
It was a ‘ good’ area , with an influx of hopeful people and criminals still spooked from the recent crackdown and collapse of their power structure- there were bad areas too , and there were areas that had been bad , that had been lowered a few notches by the portal fiasco , and by the threat of war .
“ We need to figure out how to handle this , ” Capricorn said .
“ Is that even possible ?
” Sveta asked .   
“
Handling this ?
”
“
Let me refresh before I try to answer that , ” Tristan said .
He refreshed .   
Some of the site elements lingered , while the map reloaded .   
I bit my tongue rather than comment or complain .
“ I ’ll have you guys hooked up to my internet in five or ten minutes , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Things will be faster then .
”
“
Please God , ” Tristan said .   
“ Thank you .
”
I looked at the other pins on the loading map .
“ Domestics , assaults , threats , noises at late hours , ” Sveta recited , listing pins .
“
Those are rare , ” I said .   
“ At least compared to some of these others we see over and over again .   
Look .   
Robbery .   
Dealing .   
It ’s about resources .   
It ’s about people feeling the cold and not feeling ready to face months of it , of darkness and food shortages .
”
“
That ’s not law and hero stuff , ” Sveta said .   
“
That ’s infrastructure .   
We ca n’t do much about that .
”
“ Drops in the bucket , ” Chris said .   
He was standing beside Kenzie ’s chair , watching .
“ I could help a little if they let me give them tech , ” Kenzie said from her workstation .   
“
But they wo n’t .   
Speaking of tech , second box going live .   
Additional systems , monitors , and information , no super internet just yet
, sorry .   
We ’re booting up in five , four , three , two , one- ”
There was a pause where a second or two passed .   
She kicked the box to her left .   
Projected images began to fill up more of the walls .   
News having to do with capes , with politics , with crime and industry .   
Some terrible newspaper comics popped up briefly , before being replaced by more pertinent things .
“ And zero , ” she said .   
“ Tinker internet hookup next to come .
”
In one area , according to a headline on a news ticker , Mayday was getting a hard time .   
The territories that Advance Guard was managing were seeing civilian pushback , citing Mayday ’s lack of leadership in years before Kenzie had even joined his team .
I glanced at her , but she was busy enough that she did n’t see it .   
I watched as it lingered on the ticker before other news pushed it off .
The map had loaded incompletely again , with more gray than before .   
Tristan groaned loudly in frustration , walking away .
“
We ca n’t make this about riot duty and supporting a crumbling infrastructure , ” I said .   
“ We ca n’t be extra police officers , with some extra capabilities and a lot of access and procedural stuff missing .   
It ’s inefficient .
”
“ We stop going after criminals ?
”   
Tristan asked .
“ We go after the key ones , prioritize the worst , and the ones our team can break up .   
The courts are under enough strain as is .   
They are n’t going to appreciate us sending petty drug dealers their way .
”
“
And there ’s subversive , hostile elements in the city , ” Sveta said .   
“ Earth C
’s soldiers .
”
“
That ’s the big reason we ’re needing to coordinate , ” I said .   
“
Them .   
The Fallen .   
Maybe Love
Lost
’s group .   
Possibly Prancer ’s remnants , depending on how resentful they are .   
Those who are n’t playing along or who pose too big a risk .
” Tristan added , “ And each group or major location may be targeted by hostile powers .   
Dragon , Defiant and others at the top know , but …
”
“ We have to keep an eye on the prison , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Ashley and Rain .
”
“
Yeah , ” Capricorn said .   
“ Among other things .
”
“
I was thinking about it , ” Lookout said .   
She swiveled around in her chair .   
“
It ’s a lot .
”
“
It ’s a lot , ” I agreed .
“ We can pick something to do , and we can go after it , but other stuff is going to come up while we ’re doing that , even if we ’re really , really good about it , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Even if we get the other teams to coordinate and we ’re really , really , really fast with getting other teams to cooperate with us , it ’s going to be hard .
”
“ Maybe impossible , ” Chris said .
“ Why does you chiming in like that make me suspicious ?
” Tristan asked .
“
Me ?
” Chris asked .
“
You ’re hanging out with Kenz , no snark , no hostility
, you ’re being quiet , you ’re helping-
”
“ Because he likes me , ” Kenzie said .
“
No , it ’s because , ” Chris said .   
“ I ’m not stressed about being in the latest of a long , annoying line of institutions .   
Do n’t put me in a hospital , orphanage , jail , school , I ’m good .
”
“
Good might be overstating it , ” I said .
“
You two are conspiring , ” Tristan said .
I studied their expressions , carefully neutral .   
Kenzie had the hint of a smile on her face , but she mostly seemed jittery , heel on the top of a cardboard box , foot jiggling .
“
I can see it , ” I said .
“
It ’s not a conspiracy .   
Can I just make my pitch , explain how I see things , and you can correct me if I ’m wrong ?
” Kenzie asked .
“ Go ahead , ” Sveta told her .
“
This is a big thing .   
I ’m going to end up working really hard either way , but if we go the way I was just talking about , where we try to do one big thing at a time and other stuff keeps coming up and getting in the way , we ’ll get buried , we ’ll start slipping , and I ’ll end up working super late to build stuff we super duper absolutely need .
”
“
It ’s possible .   
We could establish rules to avoid that , ” Sveta said .
“
Or , ” Kenzie said .   
“
We agree we ’re in trouble .   
If things were really terrible in a fight , Victoria would stop holding back and would hit hard to smash people to smithereens .   
Tristan and Byron would use some of their tougher tricks , like stalactite rain or drowning people in rock .
”
“ I ’ve never had cause to do that .   
I ’m not
even sure I could .
”
“
Sveta- ” Kenzie started .   
“
There ’s maybe possibly a situation where things were dangerous and you ’d leave that body .
”
“
Let ’s not discuss that , ” Sveta said .   
“ I do n’t want to entertain the idea .   
I know how bad it could be .
”
“
My point is , we ’re all really strong .   
Sometimes there ’s a situation where we stop being nice about it and just do our best .
”
I saw the almost - smile become more of a smile .   
Because her means of self expression was different , with a smile meaning something totally different , I had to parse eyebrows , eyes , mouth and body language individually and then piece it together to read her .
Worry , guilt ?
“
What did you do ?
” I asked .
She froze .
“
Smooth Kenz , ” Chris murmured .
“ Fuck off if you ’re not going to help , ” she said , under her breath .   
“
I figured we needed all the info we could get .
”
“ You did n’t take Dragon ’s files , did you ?
” Tristan asked .
“
No !   
No .   
Nothing like that , ” Kenzie said .
I imagined everyone in the room breathed a faint sigh of relief at that .   
Even Chris probably would ’ve , and she ’d apparently included him in her plan , confiding in him .
Taking Dragon ’s files would ’ve been a potential shitstorm of epic scale .
“ I took over the prison security system , so we can use their surveillance ”
Kenzie said .   
“
And Chris and I kind of worked together to get cameras inside .
”
She hit a key .   
The feeds along the wall switched to footage from the cameras spaced across the prison .   
A few of the scenes flicked between multiple perspectives across the building .
I closed my eyes .
“ Chris , why ?
” Tristan asked .
“ You ’re getting on my case ?
” Chris asked .   
“
She ’s as culpable or more culpable than I am .
”
“
She ’s two years younger than you
and you ’re supposed to be a good role model .
”
“ I failed at that a while ago , Tristan .   
And she ’s right .   
We need this , because we ca n’t take the long road every time .   
We were going to end up doing this anyway .
”
“
Why did n’t you just ask ?
” Sveta asked .
“
Because , ” Kenzie said .   
“
It ’s the kind of thing where it ’s easier to ask for forgiveness than ask permission .   
Plus if I got caught , you all can claim I ’m the ditzy tinker kid
and you had no idea what I was doing .   
It ’s proof against even lie detector capes .
”
There were some out there , in Foresight .
“
But I did n’t get caught and now the chances are really slim we get caught .   
Just like my being on their server .   
Now that it ’s done … I think it ’s done , I can tell you guys and you can decide what you want to do with it .
”
“
What is it ?
” I asked .
“
Um .   
Here .
”
She reached for a book at the edge of her workstation , checked it front and back , and tossed it to me .
A novel of the sort that was aimed at young adolescents .   
It was one
I ’d read a long time ago , but had largely forgotten .   
I remembered more of the movie of the same name .
Examining it , I found the circle of the ‘ o’ in word ‘ Holt’ on the spine had been colored in black .   
The book opened and closed , with nothing shaking out of it .
I pried at it , got my fingernails under it , and pulled it out .   
It was the eye camera that Kenzie had placed in Ashley ’s eye .   
It had phased into the book , the extra bits almost invisible , they were so phased out .
“
The books you were talking about , ” I said .
“
My care package .   
It comes with a way to keep a better eye on things .
”
“ You helped ?
”
I asked Chris .
“
The tech I had on me that they looked at was what let her get access to the security cameras , ” Chris replied .
“
Let me get this straight , ” Tristan said .   
“
You hacked a secure facility .   
Using a … virus ?
”
“ Vector of attack , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Yes .
”
“ Chris feigns being an asshole to buy time to hack in-
”
“ I did n’t feign , thank you , ” Chris said .
“ You had and have control of prison oversight now ,
” Tristan continued down his list .
“
Yes , ” Kenzie replied .
“
And you snuck in a camera- multiple cameras .
”
“ One for Ash and one for Rain , ” Kenzie said .   
“
So I can show you stuff , and we can communicate with them , and it gets a lot easier to do stuff .   
Look , look , I can show you-
”
She swiveled around and then hit buttons “ Kenzie , stop , ” Sveta said .   
“
We need to discuss this , then we need to discuss what we do with the aftermath .
”
“
Too late .   
Feed ’s up , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Sorry .
”
“ I ’ll cover your entire system in stone if you are n’t careful , ” Tristan said .   
“ Soak it in water .   
You ’re getting carried away .
”
“
I ’m saying we might need to get a little carried away because the whole situation is carried away .   
I had to do this little dodgy thing , but it means we can communicate better with them , and we definitely need that .   
It means we can communicate more to other teams , and that ’s super important .
”
The projected icon showed a slice of Ashley ’s cell .
“
This is old footage , ” Kenzie said .   
“ About half an hour ago .   
She figured it out .
”
The image distorted , the book ’s perspective shifting .
As Ashley ’s prosthetic hand reached in , almost covering up the lens in entirety , it was momentarily possible to see the artificial texture of the thumb - tip .
“
I ca n’t get you out , ”
she murmured , her voice amplified by the speakers .
There was a thud as the book was allowed to fall to the table .
“ Problem ?
”
Ashley asked , audible through the computer speakers .
“ I need your claws .
”
“
They ’re mine , and I ’m not about to hand them over .   
I like looking dangerous .
”
“
To pry something free .   
And for something else .
”
“ Pry ?   
Now I ’m curious .
”
“
Voice down for the camera .   
Come .   
Here , see the ‘ o’ ?
”
“ I see it .   
You want it cut out ?
”
“
No ! ” Kenzie said , to the wall .   
The wall and the two Ashleys were n’t in positions to hear .
“
No .   
Bring your blade this way , pry .
”
“
Do n’t scratch the edges of the lenses , ” Kenzie said , again talking to the wall .
There was no echo of her statement this time .   
The Ashleys worked in silence .
“ There .
”
“
Got it .   
Here we are .   
I ’ve seen this before .
”
“
It looks like someone wrapped barbed wire around an ice pick and put a lens on the butt end .
”
“
A small ice pick , maybe .   
I need you to stick that into my eye .
”
“
Me ?
”
“
You .
”
Kenzie ’s eyes widened .
“ Did n’t leave instructions ?
” Chris asked .
“
I …
kind of forgot that her hands are wonky right now and
her sister ’s hands are even more dangerous .
”
“ We might need to turn it on , ” Ashley said .
“
It ’s on !
”
Kenzie hurried to say , shouting at the wall .   
“
Do n’t flip the switches or you ’ll change polarity or bias , or you ’ll turn it off and it ’ll become a weird stabby knife instead of one that goes through eyes !
”
They could n’t hear us , and a phone call or message was a procedural nightmare that would take a while to arrange and use .   
Even if we did tip them off about what was going on , we ’d risk the ‘ good guys’ finding out about the cameras .
I folded my arms .
The camera ’s focus changed .   
The strange Ashley had the lens gripped by the flats of four blade fingers .   
The points of the fingers extended a bit beyond the pad or ‘ head’ of the eye camera .   
If everything went in smoothly , the points would bury inside the eye before the object fully did .
Ashley took it , not flinching as the point touched home .   
Other parts of the camera flowed in .   
The points of her sister ’s claw came perilously close to her eye and eye socket , but they did n’t penetrate .   
Our Ashley pushed it the rest of the way in with a stiff finger .
“
One eyeball on the inside , ” Tristan said .
“ Until battery runs out , ” Chris said .
“ Nuh uh , ” Kenzie said .
“ Batteries run out .   
There ’s no way you hooked that up to some greater power source and still sent it
that far away from the source .
”
“ I included a battery recharger , ” Kenzie said .
“ What you said about sleeping with your head on a book , ” I said .
“
Yeah .
”
“
Did you worry , when I had my claws so close ?   
Did you fear me ?
”   
It was the other Ashley , talking to our Ashley .
“
I trust you as far as I trust myself .
”
“
So corny , ” Chris said .   
“
I can imagine them just doing that nonstop for the next two years , and acting like it ’s still cute or funny .
”
“ For the record , ” Tristan said .   
“
You ’re not in the good books either .   
This whole thing with being underhanded and potentially screwing up everything is so not good .
”
Kenzie protested , “
In really tough fights , Victoria can go all out and hit full strength .   
In really tough information warfare , why ca n’t I do the same ?   
This stuff is maximum importance , and now we can do more with less !
”
“ We might , ” I said .   
“
But we talk this sort of thing out first .   
This is the exact opposite of what we ’re trying to do .
” Kenzie nodded , smiling .
“ We should talk restrictions , ” Sveta said .   
“
Make sure we do n’t make anyone suspicious .   
What if we waited a while before visiting again ?
”
“
What ? ”
Kenzie asked .   
“
You ’re joking .
”
Sveta said , “ We just dropped some tech off at their place and compromised their systems-
”
“
It ’s not going to get caught .   
I guarantee you .
”
“
Just to be safe , ” Sveta said .
“ You ’re punishing me .
”
“ I ’m being safe , ” Sveta said .   
“
If it ’s unreasonably safe , maybe it ’s because I do n’t like my team doing things behind my back , and I ’m uneasy .
”
“
I’m- really sorry , ”
Kenzie ’s voice had unexpected emotion in it .   
Her expression was a contrite half - smile .
“
Good , ” Sveta said .   
“
Apology accepted .
”
“ I really thought this would be best .   
We can get info to and from there without it being stuck behind paperwork , or super difficult to get there and back .   
We ’re so behind on everything ,
and-
”
“
And we communicate , ” I said .   
“ Please .
” Kenzie smiled and nodded .
Damn it .   
I ’d have to figure this out , in a time and place where I was n’t putting her on the spot .   
Smooth things over , make sure she was n’t too upset .
“
Speaking of communications , ” Chris said .   
He was on a computer .   
“
We have a peek at their systems .
”
“
Stay away from classified files , ” Tristan said .   
“
We ’ve torn past enough boundaries today already .
“
Nothing classified , ” Chris said .   
“ Employees make notes of frequent callers and people who request visits .   
We ’ve got some threads to follow .
”
“
Cheit ?
” Sveta asked .
Chris tapped the screen , before stepping back .
Rather than us go to the computer to look , Kenzie changed the display , broadcasting the image of yellow text on a black background onto the wall .
The self - proclaimed Blue Empress was wanting to see people within the prison .   
She had been refused a few times .   
For good reason .
She went by other names .   
The Woman in Blue .   
Goddess .   
She ’d taken over a world single - handedly .   
After Gold Morning , she ’d been left in our world , where she ’d lurked on the fringes .   
Something or someone in the prison had piqued her interest , and now she was exerting pressure , trying to get inside .
What to even say ?   
On the one hand , to dismiss this would be madness .   
On the other hand , to mark it as important when doing so would only encourage Kenzie …
Pieces were almost falling into place .
“ Chris , can you find information on Crystalclear ?   
Requests , communications ?
”
“
Yeah , ” Chris said .   
“ I can try .
”
I folded my arms , looking at the image on the screen , the moving text , the slow - moving query .
My aura was like a push , fear or awe .   
Lately it seemed to be only fear , with a few rare , weird exceptions .   
Monokeros could pick one person and sway them wholly and completely .   
The Woman in Blue was the best of both , or even stronger .
She ’d been making subtle moves , biding her time , and nobody knew exactly why or what that patience served .   
Now we had a glimmer of what she was doing .
She was after someone , something , or what the prison offered to someone who had absolute control over others- an army .
“ Crystalclear is in communication with others , ” Chris said .   
“
It ’s encrypted .
”
“ We can get in , ” Looksee said .   
She looked at us .   
“
If you ’re okay with that .
”
One of the biggest players around was circling around one of the biggest , meanest collections of parahumans around .   
Cheit knew and planned on turning it into a trap for her , explaining their interest in the place as a form of bait , or they ’d happened to be after the same prize .








The wind blew my hair across my gloved hand and the glowing screen of my phone .   
On the screen , a short email chain had me biting my tongue in reality , even though it was an exchange of text alone .
I flexed the arm that was no longer in the sling .   
The injury was still very much felt .
I ’d been idle for too long , because the ‘ circle’ dropped down from the top , obscuring part of the screen .   
Two options were on the circle .   
On the left , the phone offered the option of trying to draw power by way of ambient , wireless energy , including solar , EM , and whatever else .   
It would put the phone in a ‘ rest’ mode .   
On the right , a music note and a list of my music , with the phone browsing recent messages and context to try to smart - pick a playlist of music to listen to based on my guessed mood .
The phone left both up as choices , with an upward swipe to go back to what I was doing .   
Each option grew and diminished as a two - segment pie chart while the phone ’s thinking process brought up words and ideas- distance from home , recent browsing .
Just about every part of that whole process was about two steps shy of being hot garbage in terms of accuracy and functionality , but watching it happen and seeing the pie slice of ‘ rest’ shrink was a distraction .   
The countdown appeared , as the phone prepared to make its choice .
I swiped in the last second .   
The emails .
Mayday 
 Re : Proposal 
 ReSound and I are away right now .
Killing toxic waste eating mutants on Bet .
Wish I was joking .
Not even the lousiest part of my week .
If Looksee has n’t had any contact with the files or computer in question we will look at what you have .
Meet our guys on their patrol and give them a disk or something ?
Sound and I will review when we can or others can check it out and give us feedback .
Sound good ?
Will call my guys and find out who you ’d meet and where .
Antares 
 Re : Re : Proposal 
 Sounds good .   
Looksee is busy with a project- no issues there .   
I ’ve got a flash drive with info I can leave you guys . 

Sorry to hear about the mutants .   
Good luck .
Mayday 
 Re : Re : Re : Proposal 

They ’re racing down Post st .
in pursuit of unpowered criminals and should pass through Westport soon coming from the east .   
Ca n’t call them but you should be able to help intercept .
Notify if intercept fails or is too much trouble .
Is Spright Flapper Shortcut .
Mayday had a habit of writing in big blocks of text .   
In the gloom , half an hour past sunset , my phone bright and everything else dark , the grid of black text was hard to read .
I squinted at the name ‘ Shortcut’ , my teeth still set on my tongue , biting down .
Advance Guard was tricky .   
Things were n’t great when it came to Lookout and her history with a few members of that group , but Shortcut was a bit of a problem too .
My hope was that Shortcut was a chronic enough problem that his dislike of me in specific and our group in general would n’t taint things .   
We needed these groups , if we were going to make this work .   
It just so happened that Advance Guard was both the most difficult to wrangle and the fastest when it came to responses .
On the other hand , if Mayday wanted to set us up to fail here , while maintaining plausible deniability , having us offer unasked - for help to a group that included Shortcut would be the way to do it .   
Just … was it worth it ?   
What did he gain ?
Advance Guard was in a bad spot , and they had to be careful .   
It had been a leading team and its numbers had diminished .   
A handful of losses and a bit hit to morale had led to a cascading effect .   
The team was half what it was .
Despite the later hour , traffic was stop and start below us .   
Headlights formed a staccato line of yellow - gold , stabbing through a haze of illuminated car exhaust and dust .   
Behind us , the car headlights were red , the dust and car exhaust less visible in that particular light .
No sign of the chase .
Capricorn stood on a piece of construction equipment , near one of the bottlenecks that was slowing down the flow of traffic .   
He was decked out in his armor , illuminated from below by the lights of the cars , but also by the background tint of a dull orange light by the motes that swirled through the air in tight spirals , out to about fifty feet to his right , fifty feet to his left , and to varying heights above him .   
The orange light coupled with the red of taillights for an even more exaggerated effect .
As ominous as it might be , he periodically turned his head or bent down , to better communicate with people on the ground .   
Eight o’clock at night and the construction workers were still suited up , some still working , though mercifully without any heavy , loud equipment or too much obstruction of traffic .
Sveta , meanwhile , sat in the light of a spotlight that had been used for construction , that was standing in lieu of some streetlights that had been knocked over .   
There was a platform below the light , and she was there , head both bowed and askew .   
Tendrils crept out of the neck portion of her costume , back to her hair , and down the front of her body and arms .   
She was changing the colors in one of her arms , pausing here and there to look up and make sure our Advance Guard heroes and their quarry were n’t on their way .
The work she did was very precise and particular , twenty - plus tendrils looping down her body , around her arms and then anchoring at different points on three different paintbrushes .   
The movements of each paintbrush were meticulous , six to ten tendrils all pulling at the same time , one relaxing to allow the others to pull it away from that direction .   
At the same time , a tendril worked its way around her face , gripping her eyelid , working her way into the socket .
She shook her head fiercely , and it pulled away .   
Others snapped out to grip the edges and bars of the platform she sat on .
Dangerous , maybe , to be doing it in the open , but she was above the cars , on a platform a distance away from the road , the people were safe within vehicles , and she was partially anchored to her body and the platform .   
I knew she had control enough that she ’d been able to hang out with me
and she had n’t lost control to the point that she ’d broken my forcefield .
I put my phone away , drifting through the sky , to find a position where it was n’t pitch dark , but where I was n’t breathing in car exhaust or letting the wind blow my hair into my face .
Sveta spotted me .   
I watched as the paintbrushes were pulled into a plastic package , still wet , and tendrils retreated into her body with remarkable speed .   
Her head tilted one way
and then the other as she closed up her shell , locking the tendrils within .   
She raised a hand .
My invitation to approach .
I flew to her , one eye on the direction the criminals were supposed to be coming from .   
She was closing up the paint- a curated selection of paints in the same colors she had as part of her outfit , each ‘ pot’ no larger than a dairy creamer .
“
Can I see ?
” I asked .
She twisted around to show me her new paint .   
“
Patching up scuffs , and the shading on the octopus face never looked right .
”
“
It looks good .   
I ca n’t give you a real verdict until we have better lighting .
”
“
Yeah , ” she said .   
“
All these poor people .   
It ’s eight fifteen , and they ’re still on their way home .   
Would n’t it be nice if we could make a big dinner , go car to car , and hand out chowder or something ?
”
“
That ’s the go - to ?   
Chowder ?
”
“
Yeah , ” Sveta said , eyes widening at the thought .   
“ Soup is just depressing .   
It makes you think ‘ soup kitchen’ .   
Thin , and in times like this , you know you ’re getting it because there ’s not much and
the people serving you are trying to stretch things as far as they ’ll go .   
But chowder ?   
Big chunks of salmon or crab ?   
Tons of butter and salt , then some potato , onion , celery , some dill ?
”
“ Sticks to the stomach .   
Serve with some rolls .   
Toasted , ideally .
”
“
Yeah , absolutely .   
Fresh baked rolls .   
That ’s part of it .   
It ’s not enough that the quality is there .   
There has to be just enough in a serving that people ca n’t eat it all in one go .   
Give them that tiny bit of security for tomorrow .
”
Impractical , a herculean task to put together .   
And it was far from being part of the ten percent of issues we were gearing up to tackle .
But this was n’t about practicality .   
That was n’t what she was imagining or spelling out .
“
It makes me think of crisis points , ” I said .   
“ Head to the houses where the crimes just happened , say hi , offer to patrol the area for a bit , just to help them feel a bit safer- security .   
Like you said .   
Visit the church , talk to the people who just lost their home .   
Police stations , hospitals .
”
“
Absolutely , ” Sveta ’s voice was barely audible .   
In the distance , cars were honking .   
It did n’t look like it was because the villains were whizzing by .   
“
Except nowadays , if you want to help the traumatized … ”
I brought my hand up to my hair , to push it back behind my ear , before I flipped up my hood to try and give my hair some shelter .   
My eyes were on the road , my ears on the honking and on the slams of car doors , as people opened them and leaned out the side of their cars , trying to see what lay ahead .
“
It would be nice if we could wave our hands and get all of them home , ” I murmured .   
“
Get the obstacles out of the way , dedicate some time , help with reconstruction , and make it happen .   
Give the ones who missed dinner because they ’ve been on the road for the last two hours and there are n’t any rest - stops .   
But doing too much is a problem too .   
We do what we can .
”
“ I want to find the middle ground between not doing too much and not being self - indulgent .
”
“ That’s- self - indulgent ?   
That ’s not what I think of when I think of you , ” I said .
“ Except I am , are n’t I ?   
This body paint- some like it
but it ’s by me , for me .   
The wig , it ’s for me .   
The body , the hassle others go through for me , to help me with the little things .   
The trip I took with Weld , all for me , and the errands surrounding getting this body put together-
he did n’t have that much time before he started with the Wardens , and it all went to me .
”
“
Ah , this is about Weld ?   
Even the parts you talked about that are n’t about Weld .
”
She paused , deer in the spotlight .   
“
Yeah .   
Am I that obvious ?
”
“ There were hints .   
For what it ’s worth , I think he ’s the kind of guy who gets invigorated and refreshed by helping others .   
He seemed pretty genuinely happy that you were where you were at , that first meeting .
”
“ I dunno , ” Sveta said .   
She shrugged , shoulders squeaking slightly .   
“
I wanted to make him something for dinner the other day , and he said no .   
It took me a bit before I found out it might be a bit of a chore , trying to find things he can eat .   
He came home so mentally worn out that he did n’t have it in him to pretend or feign interest .   
What else do I do for him , if you cancel that out or call it a chore ?   
What can I do for him ?   
It ’s supposed to be a partnership .
”
“
It ’s not an answer , but
… one thing I found , that I talked to Dean with a few times , is that guys ca n’t always wear their hearts on their sleeves .   
They ca n’t turn to their friends and cry it out .   
So they bear it , carry it .
”
“
Dean would know that stuff , huh ?
”
“
Some .   
I ’m generalizing a lot .   
Thing is , a lot of the time , guys only have one outlet , if they have one at all .   
And even then , they-
”
I saw lights in the distance .   
Advance Guard had the costumes with panels , sharp angles , illuminated sections and hyper - modern cuts .   
Some of the panels , it seemed , acted like reflectors , or were bright enough to make them distinct from a distance in the dark .
“
There they are .
”
“
I see them , ” Sveta said .
“ We ’ll talk about this later ?
”
“ Please , ” she said .   
“
I do n’t know who else to ask about some of this stuff .
” I got Capricorn ’s attention with a wave , pointing .   
He nodded .   
The orange motes swirled more .
He had n’t solidified the motes into anything .   
He just kept drawing , the motes remaining in the same spaces , filling in gaps between orange lines .
Flapper had her wings out –
her clothes had altered , sleeves extended to great length , formed into great wings that she beat , as she swooped and dove to ride air currents .   
The wind was at her back , and she had the natural flier advantage of not needing to worry about following the road or terrain .    
Where the road curved , she could fly in a straight line .   
Nothing like the old - timey flapper style to her , except the short dress in the Advance Guard style .
Shortcut-
I could see him on the ground , periodically obscured as he moved behind trucks and obstacles .   
He was fast , but it was hard for him to see where he was going .   
He zig - zagged , with careful movements .
And then Spright- who had both the wings out , though he was n’t flying .   
His feet were on the ground , and the same stop - start zig - zag motion , if a bit freer .
I flew for the spotlight that Sveta was under .   
Gripping it , I twisted it around , aiming it at the incoming pursuit , keeping the worst of the light out of Shortcut and Spright
’s eyes .   
Flapper was high enough up that she was n’t going to be blinded .
Two trucks , what might have been postal vans or armored trucks-
I would n’t know until I was closer .   
One eighteen wheeler , that lagged behind the rest .   
One parahuman-
a man in what looked like a blurry hamster wheel .   
All traveled on the flat ground to the side of the road .   
Traffic of construction vehicles had torn up the ground already , and the passage of these vehicles kicked up geysers of mud and dust , depending on how dry or cold the ground was where they passed .
The hamster wheel was the worst of it , when it came to the collateral mess .   
The geysers of flung dirt would ’ve painted the face of a two - story building .
“ Do n’t engage just yet !
”
“
Right ! ”
Sveta called .
I gave the hamster wheel guy a wide berth , flying to Spright .   
The moment I got close to him , though , he kicked off the ground , taking flight with what looked like a combination of my flight and Flapper ’s .
“
Yesss !
”
he called out , before lunging forward with a combination of wing flaps and Glory Girl flight .
Which , inconveniently , meant I could n’t ask him stuff .   
It left me two options – Shortcut and Flapper .
“ Flapper !
”
I called out .   
“
Mayday sent us !   
What ’s this ! ?
”
“ Capes and getaway drivers .   
Living cargo in the trucks !
”
“
What capes ?
”
“ Trial and Error !   
Trial ’s the wheel , crazy strong , but he ’s tiring out !   
You ca n’t hit Error !   
She picks one person and they ’re fucked .   
There ’s a general fucked effect around her too !
”
“
There ’s an aircraft runway and helicopter landing pad at Westport Stretch !
”
I warned .
I saw her digest that .
“
Does Spright know the rules ?
”
I asked , flying closer to her .   
I could feel the force of the wing flaps .
“
He knows !
”
I flew in the direction of the wheel , who was leading the way now .   
Sveta was keeping pace , but only barely .   
Ahead of us , Capricorn had his motes of light , ready to form his barricade , if he had to .
Airspace meant restricted flying .   
Standard operating protocol for getaway drivers was to try to cut through an area where police helicopters could n’t pursue .   
Once the aerial was lost , it was that much easier to disappear on the ground .   
Westport was large enough that it was conceivable that three trucks could disappear , if advance preparations had been taken .
“ Wheel is heavy offense !
”
I called to Sveta , as I caught up .   
“
One truck has a stranger !   
Trial and Error !   
Stranger in truck with fucky effect !
”
She went for the trucks , leaping onto one cab roof .
“
Careful !
”
I called out .
Traffic was mostly at a standstill , and we were racing past it , to the point it was easy to imagine we were traveling faster than we were .   
The air was cold , and it was filled with flecks of dirt , in the wake of those guys .
Capricorn ’s wall popped into being .   
Crenellated , styled , with ram - headed men in stoic , stern positions at set intervals along the wall
’s length .   
For the moment , the bottleneck on the real road was made small enough to only let small , regular cars through .
Trial was gunning for the wall now , evading Spright ’s harrying fly - bys .   
Shortcut drew nearer , raised his weapon while skating on the grass , and then leaped- only to skip the follow - through .   
He ducked and rolled on the ground , got his feet under him , and resumed skidding endlessly on the ground , legs barely moving , while holding his polearm .
I gestured , as dramatically as I could , for Capricorn to get down , my arm sweeping from above my head to down and away .
He jumped off the wall at the same time
Trial reached it .   
Trial unfolded from his wheel form , going high with the final ‘ kick’ of the disassembling wheel , and his mechanism became clear- chains .   
Heavy chains with what looked like telekinetic control slammed into Tristan ’s wall and knocked a good chunk of it down like it was a sand castle .
He was still airborne as the chains came down toward other targets .   
Spright evaded , as did Shortcut .   
The remains of the wall could n’t .   
Chain snagged the remaining parts and flung them away .   
One chunk came toward me , with Flapper a short distance behind me .   
It became water in the air , and I was sprayed by what felt like a shower of ice - cold needles , breaking my forcefield in the initial spray , the follow - up pricking my exposed skin , the liquid soaking my costume .
I would have preferred the big chunk of rock .
A truck passed through the gap Trial had made .   
Spright harassed it .   
Shortcut followed behind , but without much vigor .   
He did n’t attack .
They were getting through .   
The second truck .   
The third had Sveta on it-
she was reaching inside the cab , forcing a hard brake .   
It had to be the emergency brake she ’d grabbed .
“
Knock it over ! ?
”
Flapper called out to me .   
“
Gently !
”
I could do that , especially given the gentle slope away from the proper road with the gridlock of cars .   
I threw myself at the side of the truck Sveta had stopped .   
Wretch out .   
Fingers gripped corrugated metal , digging in until they found purchase in the heavier , sturdier frame .
With flight , some strength , and some attention to pushing on the end where the wheels sat on more of a slope , letting the torque of that initial motion carry through to the front of the eighteen wheeler ’s container , then to the cab at the very front .   
Once it started moving , I flew along the side , arm out , forcefield skimming against the corrugated metal , periodically snagging or catching on it as hands that were n’t mine gripped parts of it .
But the pressure and the push that moved forward helped with using the rotation that was already there .   
The truck tipped .   
The wretch gripping metal and the fact that the metal had to tear for the truck to fall was even something of a help .
I flew up , gathered myself , and flew down , kicking at the point between the door and the frame of the vehicle .   
With the benefit of my forcefield , the kick served to bend metal .   
That door would n’t open easily .
Glancing at the others to make sure there was no imminent danger , I hopped down , and I used my aura to drive the point home .   
Through the windshield , I could see a face reacting to the aura .
Hopefully he would stay put .   
Breaking an intact windshield or opening a car door that was above him and damaged would be very difficult .
Flapper ’s wings had transformed-
each had been an exaggerated overextension of her sleeves , but now they each had middle fingers- lengths in the middle that she was using to attack in time with her wingbeats .
A combination of wind , trying to stay aloft so she could attack from above , no doubt her most effective tactic , and a slip in her technique led to her misgauging things .   
She missed the van and could n’t get her wing up in time for another flap , as it slapped the ground by the moving vehicle .
I flew to her rescue , as she fell , landing hard .   
Her wing hit construction equipment and one car at the head of the line .   
I could hear her swearing .
“
Careful ! ”
Sveta called out .   
She ’d been on a vehicle , but she was moving alongside the convoy now .   
She looked scuffed , her hair in disarray .
“
What ’s going on ! ?
”
I called out .
“
That stranger effect !
”
You ca n’t hit Error .
Shortcut had n’t been able to hit Trial .   
He ’d decided to hold back .   
Flapper had told me that the stranger effect stuck on someone , and then there was a general effect on the parahuman and their truck .
Flapper had apparently decided to test the limits of that general effect .
Capricorn had been left a bit behind , but he was active .
“ Heads up !
” the words were bellowed , in the top - of - the - lungs way , where it would have hurt .
And it was n’t in Tristan ’s voice .   
Even in a shout , I could hear the difference in the two boys .
Water shot toward the armored vans in five mirror spurts , all flying in parallel .   
Each jet of water became solid as Capricorn blurred , coalescing into javelins .   
They landed in front of one vehicle- and that vehicle rammed them .   
The van shuddered , rocked , and then swerved , before coming to a stop .
Leaving Spright , Shortcut , Sveta and I against Trial , Error , and the mooks from the trucks .
A push of my aura helped to spook them .   
They ’d been grabbing what they had on hand for self defense , and they slowed for a moment .
“
Boss ?
” one asked , nervously .   
“
You need us ?   
I do n’t think we can fight capes .
”
“
Stay by the truck .   
We can handle this , ” Trial said .   
He said it with near - complete confidence , too .   
If there was a waver or a pause a tenth of a second longer , it was because of my aura .
Only fear , these days , with exceptions for someone like Kenzie .
Trial had armor in overlapping plates that were each connected by chains , and more chains wrapped around him .   
His mask was the best part of it , with a shaped metal mask that contoured to the angles of his face , and two ‘ laurel’ horns , and the mask was only a B- .
Error had a costume with red ‘ x’ icons across it , in a motif that recurred like spikes did on a punk rocker .   
She wore a medical mask with a red ‘ x’ on it , and a flat - top hat with the same above the bill , and I could see a white outline where it had been cut imprecisely from whatever the source material was .   
The non - red parts of the costume mixed khaki green and black .   
Nothing about it was even B- .
Error .   
She made people fuck up .   
Right .
It was such a bad name , it gave so much away and it barely worked as a cape name .   
It was such an offensive costume from a design standpoint …
Trial , unless I was missing something in the background of the name , did n’t even make sense given the guy ’s power , it was a shitty gimmick …
“
Did n’t ask for help , ” Shortcut said .
I was already irritated , digesting who we were up against , and he had to go and say that .
“
I had something to hand over , you guys can watch it or pass it to Mayday .   
If you want , we can leave .
”
“ Leave , ” Shortcut said .
“ Do n’t leave !
”
Spright said .   
“ Please .   
Shortcut , ease-
”
Trial lashed out with chains .
I flew to intercept .
“
No ! ” Shortcut bellowed .
I felt the pressure wash over me before I even got to the chain .   
If my response to Shortcut saying something might ’ve been mixed , given our past history , the sensation helped tip me to the one side of the scale .   
I changed course in mid - air , flying straight to the ground .
The chain flew over my head .   
It came perilously close to Spright and Shortcut , but both were nimble , using Shortcut ’s power .   
They dodged .
Sveta , as quick as her hands were , was n’t able to reach out and grab something , and also haul herself away , before the chain could connect .   
The chain clipped her .   
I heard the impact .
“ Error ’s specific , ” Shortcut said , like Sveta had n’t just taken a hit .   
“
She turns your attacks-
”
I flew to Sveta ’s side .
“ Against you .   
Including deflections .
”
I saw the chains move .   
I tensed , ready to fly up there , to beat the incoming attack back , collateral be damned .
What happened , then , if I deflected ?   
The chains went in the worst possible direction for our side ?   
Did I miss and hit the wrong part ?
“
Do n’t , ” Shortcut said .   
“ Trial .   
Do n’t .
”
Spright added , “ You lost your cargo , she ’s giving medical attention , the other one needs it .   
You do n’t fuck with that .
”
“ Nobody cares about that anymore , ” Error said .
Sveta ’s chest was broken .   
Tendrils were creeping out .
“
You alright ?
” I murmured .
“ Rattled .   
Broken .   
I have stuff , but I ca n’t move my arms .
”
In another situation , where the rules were in place , Sveta might be fine like this .   
She could lie dormant and wait for help , or ask for the coast to be cleared .
It was always the problem , lingering in the background .
She looked tense .
“
Can I ?
” I asked .   
At the nod , I reached for the small of her back , where her clothes covered her kits .   
I saw some smaller tendrils reach out for my hand and stop short .
Her tendrils were growing over time .   
She grew new ones .   
Right now she was keeping the longest at bay , because they were a danger to others , not just to me .
“
This is taking concentration , ” Sveta said .
I grabbed the kit , hauling it free with a tug that would have been violent if Sveta ’s body were flesh .
This situation was requiring me to split my own concentration .   
I was trying to ignore Trial and his chains , and the fact that Error had her hand hovering near her belt .   
The bars at the side- batons ?
Nunchucks .
“
Let us go , ” Trial said .   
He had an accent like someone from the midwest .   
“
We take our trucks , we drive away , and you stay .
”
“ I ca n’t see myself agreeing to that , ” Shortcut said .
“ I ’ll attack those girls , ” Trial said .   
“
And I ’ll attack that line of cars .   
Error
’s
rule means that no matter what you do , it ’s going to be messy .   
The heroes ca n’t afford it .
”
“ If you attack us , the only mess will be the stains your bodies leave behind , ” I growled .
“ We ’re willing to take that risk , ” Trial said .   
“
But only if we have to .   
You can afford to let us go .   
It ’s pigs , chickens , and cum .
”
“ Valuable ,
needed pigs and chickens , ” Spright said .   
“
The equipment and refrigerated material for breeding stock .   
Forty pigs at a thousand a head , plus the other stuff , forty - two thousand on the one truck , easy .
”
I pushed the seal over the armor-
the damage was enough that one patch did n’t cover it all .   
Tendrils reached around and touched my hand .   
I pulled away .
“ Pigs , chicken , and jizz … or their lives .   
And their lives ?
” Trial asked .   
The tip of the chain turned in the air to point for him .   
At me and Sveta , then the cars .
I did n’t want to be a bargaining chip .   
I gripped Sveta by the shoulders .
I had to wait .   
Wait until I could be sure Error would n’t focus on me , use her power , and potentially turn my attempt at an evacuation into a horrible disaster .
A tendril wrapped itself around my hand .   
It squeezed , and it squeezed against my forcefield .   
The forcefield did n’t break , but I was aware of the strain .   
Fuck
me-
I was too close to Sveta , I could see the whites of her eyes .   
She was too close to me .   
I ’d destroyed door handles on cars and pavement like this , and she was this close .
I canceled my forcefield , and something in the micron of slack that resulted saw the tendril fail to cinch tighter , then unwind .   
It twisted and kinked in the air before retreating into the crack .   
I pressed down another patch .
Sveta had her eyes closed .
Capricorn was approaching .   
I saw a mote pass me , and I shook my head .   
Error saw , turning to Capricorn .   
He froze .
Spright looked at me .   
I raised my hand , indicated with a thumb jab .   
That got me a nod .
I seized Sveta and dragged her away .
Trial twisted around , chains raising up around him .   
Four at each side , each as big around as his arms were , tipped with a spiked ball as large as his head .
Error , meanwhile , had her hands out to her sides , one in front , one to her left .   
A mime pressing against two walls of her invisible box .   
Except it wasn’t- she was broadcasting , or maintaining a signal .
Trial went on the offensive .   
chains whirled at one side , rotating in a circle with enough force to strike the ground and cast him forward .   
Spright slid on the ground , ran to chase-
“ Go , ” Sveta said .
I charged in .
Spright manifested his own chains .   
He started to swing them around-
and then stopped .   
Chains shattered , each individual link breaking .   
He turned to look at Error .
Too dangerous to use when under her influence ?
I had to unravel this- figure it out .   
While her back was to me , I could go after her .   
Wretch out- one move to take her out of the fight .   
Given what we were up against , I was n’t sure we ’d get a second shot .
A swing for the legs , like I ’d done when hitting concrete .
I felt the effect as I got within a few feet .   
I felt it intensify as I swung-
I saw other movement in the corner of my eye .   
Shortcut closing in .   
The effect was like grabbing soap , only for it to slip free of one ’s hands .   
The swing was too soon , the angle and arc , and Shortcut
’s timing of super - quick approach put him squarely in the way .
I canceled out my power .   
I swung only a fist , and my fist turned up , so I struck him with a lighter blow using the heel of my hand instead .   
I hit him in the shoulder , strength unaugmented .
He shoved me away .   
He swung his polearm , missed , and the butt end of the thing came perilously close to me .   
If I had n’t been flying back and away , it would have hit me .
Was it because it did n’t hit me that it succeeded in scratching her ?   
Or was the power itself no guarantee ?
More concerning was the chain guy .   
Trial .   
I flew back , out of shortcut ’s reach , and I tried to find an opening .
The chains were defensive-
they slapped at Byron ’s water , they blocked Spright .   
They were offensive– small wrecking balls with whip - crack power behind them .   
They were mobility .   
Whirling them in one hand like a wheel or whipping them around him like a fucking skip rope -I hated these guys- moved him at high speeds , with good maneuverability .
Error might need to concentrate .   
She seemed to focus on looking at people .
Identify the cracks , then strike .   
So long as it was reasoned out and so long as it did n’t escalate … I hit the ground , scooping up as much as the Wretch could get , and sending a cascade of dirt and clumps of earth at Error and into the air .   
In the process , I hit Shortcut , because of course I did .   
But as much as it blinded and debilitated him , it also served to blind and limit her .   
I flew in closer , aura on , and I did n’t feel the pressure of that power settling in around me , warping space or altering my tactile and visual senses , or whatever it did .
Sveta ’s hand grabbed me .   
I turned to look-
and I saw that the dust was thick enough in the air that she could n’t tell us apart , a fact that was n’t helped by darkness and dirt .
I did the natural thing to communicate to her without tipping off Error .   
I gave the hand a waggle .
Then I grabbed it and I threw it out in Error ’s direction .
With how this power seemed to work , it might get Shortcut instead .   
That would win us points .
But Shortcut , blinded , had backed off .   
Sveta ’s hand dragged Error to her , and though her other arm was still disabled , she wrapped her legs around Error
’s neck and shoulders .
That left Trial- and Trial was winning .   
Capricorn had sealed chains down by creating water and turning that water to stone , but with a simple tug , the chains came free , stone flecks flying .   
Shortcut was fended off , and Spright was maneuverability , not offense .
And , it seemed , even with where we were at , Error could use her power .   
Spright came dangerously close to impaling himself on Shortcut ’s halberd .
On the ground ten feet from me were Capricorn ’s javelins .   
As I approached them , people backed away .
“
Cover her eyes !
”
I called out to Sveta .   
At those words , Trial looked and he seemed to realize the position and the numbers .
He lunged for the street , where cars still choked the road .   
Chains went up , and I turned on the Wretch , reaching for javelins that were n’t in my reach .
“
No ! ” Shortcut shouted .   
“ Stop .
”
There was a pause , as if nobody was entirely sure he was referring to them , nobody wanted to stop if the others were still going .   
At this stage , people on the other side could be maimed or killed if the dynamic shifted .
“ Pause , ” Spright said .
The lighter word seemed to have more impact than the shout and the firmer ‘ stop’ .
“ Stop , ” Shortcut said .   
“
You really want to go this far ?
”
“ As far as we have to , ” Trial said .
“ Then go .   
Take your semen .   
Take your swine .   
Take your cocks .   
You ’re in good company .
” I wanted to facepalm at the lame line , but Shortcut was on our side .
And frankly , I could n’t fault him for calling it here .
It was n’t worth .
“
Hens actually , ” Trial said .   
“
Let my friend go .
”
“ We ’re giving you a head start , but this definitely is n’t over , ” Shortcut said .   
He gestured at Sveta .
Error climbed to her feet .
“
This way , ” Trial said .   
He gestured at the trucks .   
He was careful to remain within a chain ’s length of the road , doing so with Error at his side .   
“
There should be one more truck .
”
“ Tipped over , ” I said .
He shook his head .   
“ Tip it back over .
”
“ Driver was unconscious , last I saw , ” I lied .   
“
You can send someone if you want .   
Maybe Error can drive .
”
“
It ’s not worth , ” Error said .
I watched as Trial considered his options .
He indicated for the trucks to go , with one pausing by him to let Error on .   
The chains started up , and they were gone .
“ We ’ll tail , ” Shortcut said .   
He looked at me .   
“
You …
”
“ We can cooperate on this .
”
“ We could , ” he said .   
“
No .   
Spright , tell Flapper to handle this mess , talk to the unconscious one when they wake up .    
Catch up with me after .
”
Then he was gone .
“ Dick , ” Capricorn muttered under his breath .
“
Yeah .   
No way that was going to end well , ” Spright said .   
“ Heavy hitter paired with that kind of stranger power .   
We ’ll take our lumps .   
This loss is Advance Guard ’s fault , provided you do n’t ask Shortcut to assign blame .   
Always good to see you .
”
“
Spright-
” I said , interrupting before he could go .
“
What ’s up ?
”
“
Two things .   
Mayday wanted me to pass this on .   
It ’s a proposal for information sharing , networking .   
Dividing up the ten percent of threats that really need cape attention , swapping out .   
Take a look ?
”
He took the flash drive .   
He considered for a moment , the nodded .   
He floated a foot above the ground , borrowing my power .   
Just the movement aspect .
“
Second thing is …
I ’m not
okay with leaving it like this .
”
“
Me either , but sometimes we need to eat our losses .
”
“ I do n’t like losing , ” Capricorn said .
“
What do you say I gather reinforcements and we do this again , try to corner them ?   
This time with no civilians nearby .
”
“ If you want to try , I ’m not going to complain .   
You have my number .   
It wo n’t make Shortstuff happy , but … ” “
Rare thing ?
” Capricorn asked .
“
Sure .   
Do me a favor and brief Flappy ?
”
“ Okay , ” Capricorn said .
Then Spright was gone , flying away using my power .
“ I ’ll call and check on Sveta , ” I said .   
“
You handle that side ?   
See what the driver of the big truck says ?
”
“
Yeah , ” was the reply .   
Capricorn jogged off .
Yeah .
I had my phone out a moment later .   
The automated process for idling had selected one of the songs I ’d downloaded for Gilpatrick during one of the Patrol
’s visits to a school .   
Gun rules as a song for grade schoolers .
Because of course it had .
Tristan was gone .   
Sveta was sitting up , rubbing at the shoulder that was n’t working , near where the damage was , and the cars were moving down the road , barely visible past the cover of construction .
At least chances were slim that some of the Error - induced disasters had n’t been caught on camera .   
I could imagine that would go over well .
With the phone pressed to my ear , I walked over to the javelins , which were almost lost in the dirt that had been turned over by the passage of the vans and slashes of the chain whip .
I released the Wretch , and I reached out with my free hand , the bicep twinging from the gunshot wound that had n’t fully healed .
Come on .   
Come on .   
Come on .
If it had mattered , would I have been able to ?
Come on .
The Wretch grabbed the first javelin , then the next , and then a third .   
One broke in two-
a bite , not a hand .
The other two , the Wretch simply held .   
I waited , then I moved my hand .   
There was no way to tell if it would work or not , because they broke to pieces as the grip tightened or changed .
I bent down and looked in the direction Capricorn had gone , and I reached down to one of the chunks of stone .
It crumbled in my grip .   
No power in effect .
We ’ll work this out , I told the Wretch .
I straightened .   
Sveta reached me , having walked over .   
Her metal shoulder bumped my spiked one .   
Solidarity .
The phone was answered .   
There was squabbling .   
Boy and girl .
“ Cryptid .
”
“ She has n’t gone home ?
”
“
No family dinner to get back to .   
She ’s fiddling .   
Her person ’s here , the guy Natalie knows .
”
“ I ’ll have a talk with her in the morning , ” I said .   
Talks were overdue .
“
You call for something ?   
I hope you called for something .   
I was asleep and you woke me up .   
The thing go okay ?
”
“ Atrociously , actually , ” I said .   
“
But it ’s not over , as far as I ’m concerned .   
I need you to call people .
”
I could hear his groan .   
I could also hear Kenzie in the background , volunteering her help .
“ Or give me the numbers .   
I ’ll call .
”
“
It ’s fine .   
I ’ll do some .   
Which people ?
”
“ Everyone underlined in green .   
It ’s not an emergency , but if they ’ll do us this favor and help out , we ’ll pay them back , or I will .
”
There was a pause .
“
If I did n’t spontaneously swap rods and cones in my eyes , that ’s … a lot of people .
”
They were the ones I did n’t think would take too much convincing , ones we ’d worked with or had contact with .
Capricorn was back .   
There had n’t been delay in getting the info .   
His arms were folded as he stared at me , and orange motes danced to either side of his head , forming shapes .   
Like branches .
Like antlers .
Prancer .   
His last hurrah , or his new and improved way of doing business .   
It could n’t be easy- not someone we were already gunning for .   
It only reaffirmed my conviction here .








“ I have a random thought , ” I said .
Sveta and Capricorn were with me .   
Heroes were arriving- some in cars .   
They were the ones I ’d labeled in green .   
The friends , the acquaintances , the ones where I figured there was enough trust that we could promise a favor in exchange for their help and they ’d listen .   
Our vantage point on the roof of a garage put us above them all .
“
Do share , ” Sveta said .
“ When the team was first getting together , I was trying to wrap my head around it .   
In thinking about names and thinking about themes , whatever I thought about , I felt like there was always at least one odd man out .
”
“ I know what you mean , ” Capricorn said .   
“ Branding , theme , style .   
If the team goes rugged then you , me , Ashley and Lookout are tough to fit in , while Chris and Rain are happy as clams .   
Sveta can adapt to that .   
If we go polished , preppy , hair done up … opposite .
”
“ Applies to other things too , ” I said .
“
And I do n’t think I could adapt to polished , ” Sveta said , cutting in before I could return to my thought .
Capricorn shrugged .   
“
You ’ve got the creative , artistic touch and a pretty face .   
You could change how you do your arms .   
I really think you could pull it off .
”
“ Except I do n’t want to , and I ’m uncomfortable , ” she said .   
“
Sorry , can we change the subject ?
”
“
Sure , ” Capricorn said .   
“
But before we drop it- ”
“
Capricorn , ”
I interrupted , my voice a warning .
“
What ?
”
“ Boundaries , ” I said .
“
Really .   
It ’s twice now in recent memory
you ’ve wanted to change the topic .   
This is just me adding to the discomfort for five seconds
so I can avoid all of it in the future .   
Okay ?
”
“
Okay , ” Sveta replied , sighing like it was an extension of the word .
“ Why uncomfortable ?
”
“
Um .   
Saying I have a pretty face is a very nice thing to say- ”
“
No hetero , ” he interrupted .
“ -er , yes , ” she said .   
She smiled despite herself .   
“
But it reminds me that I ’m just a face , pretty much .   
Sorry , I ’ve been thinking a lot about … um , bodies , and my lack of one , because of stuff I brought up with you both .
”
“
Got it , ” Tristan said .   
“
Chat me up if you want to pick my brain again .   
Until then , no talk of bodies or boning .
”
“
Thank you , ”
she said the two words with finality .   
She looked at me , “ There was always one person who did n’t fit in , when you tried to create a cohesive identity ?   
Except maybe for the , uh , group .
”
The therapy .
“ Victoria was n’t a part of that , ” Capricorn said .
“ I guess , ” she replied .
“ Thing is , ” I said .   
“
Standing here , thinking about how I did n’t even have to ask Capricorn if he was on board with seriously going after these guys- ” “
Damn fucking straight , ” Capricorn said it with enough force that a few heads turned our way .
“
We ’re tenacious , ” I said .   
“
Every last member of the group , we ’ve been given every reason to give up and we pushed on .
”
“ For better or for worse .   
Poor Lookout , ” Capricorn said .
“ I can get behind the idea , ” Sveta said .   
“ Tenacious .
”
I stood a little straighter , taking in the group of gathered heroes .   
I drew in a breath .   
“
Then let ’s go be stubborn .   
We ’re not going to accept this loss .
”
“
Yeah , ” Capricorn said .
I flew down from the roof of the concrete garage .   
I went straight from flying to striding forward .   
Capricorn hopped down , though it was n’t a distance most would want to jump- twenty feet onto packed dirt , a heavy landing with the armor he wore .   
Just a little bit of enhanced physique could go a long way .
Sveta ’s landing was n’t as graceful .   
I heard the noise as she hauled herself , turned to look , and saw her coming my way .   
My arm went out and I caught her with it- stopping her from stumbling forward while helping to keep her upright .
She took my hand and gave it a momentary squeeze .
Heroes gathered around us .   
Fume Hood was present- Tempera was n’t .   
Lighter had come , which was nice-
it was my first time seeing the low - key vigilante , though we ’d talked some by email .   
He ’d been scheduled for a turn at harassing Cedar Point , but things had gone to hell before the scheduled time had come .   
He ’d been enthusiastic about that-
and I could assume he ’d like the idea of this .
Sometimes a team seemed like too much , but being a solo hero was too lonely .   
Triggering tended to involve some lack of support structures-
that was Parahumans 101 , class one , an hour and fifteen minutes into the three hour lecture level stuff .   
To go from that to being a costumed hero did n’t generally involve gaining more support .
Maybe this would appeal .
Houndstooth was absent , but two of his subordinates were present .   
I recognized Foxtrot and another member of the Kings of the Hill .   
Foxtrot ’s chatter about the Cedar Point operation had led to Advance Guard jumping in and our involvement being spoiled .   
Well , I had my suspicions that Scapegoat might have helped matters .   
The defected healer from Advance Guard was the primary one to blame- but Foxtrot had let some minor things slip .
My parents had been on that list of heroes with green labels .   
I ’d been pretty certain that in an emergency , they ’d help .   
If I asked , even .   
But they had n’t answered the call , and they were n’t here .   
I could n’t fault them
– three out of four of the people we ’d reached out to had n’t .
“ You want to handle this ?
”
I asked Capricorn , as we drew nearer .
“
Nah .   
Let me lead in , but this is your idea .
” I nodded .
Twelve capes in all , from various teams .   
More would have been nice , but we ’d reached out at eight - something at night to essentially say we wanted a hand , could they meet us near the mid - Megalopolis point in the next ten minutes ?   
Some had been too far , others had been retired for the evening …
these numbers were good , considering .
“
Thank you for coming ,
” Capricorn said .   
“
I ’ll recap in case our teammate did n’t spell it out in full when he reached out .   
Two villains , strong ones , just threatened civilians to get the good guys to back off so they could make a run for it .   
They ’re driving trucks of stolen livestock .   
The one we caught said they ’re working for Prancer , from Cedar Point .
”
I started my piece .   
“
We feel the rules need enforcing .   
They ca n’t threaten civilians .   
Help us , and we ’ll either owe you one or
if you want a longer - term relationship , we can talk about building something .
”
Lighter was nodding .   
Fume Hood looked receptive-
but I was n’t sure if that was her trying to be helpful , putting on a good face .
“
Where are they now ?
”
Foxtrot asked .
“ Just north of here .   
Mover and multiple vehicles , ” Capricorn said .   
“ Trial and Error .
”
“
I ’ve run into them , ” Lighter said .   
“
Trial hits hard .   
I did n’t get Error .
”
“
Good names , ” Foxtrot said .
We ’ll have to politely disagree on that , I thought .   
Instead of voicing that thought , I explained , “ Trial hits hard
, he ’s defensive , and he ’s mobile , manipulating chains and spinning them to propel himself forward .
”
“
Yep , ” Lighter said .   
“ Good summary .
”
“ Error is a stranger .   
She seems to blur perceptions so you lose coordination and lose track of who ’s on the battlefield and where .   
That includes whoever you ’re trying to hit , I think .   
She seemed to have an always - on effect surrounding her at low strength and a concentrated , magnified use that seemed to require her eyes and focus to be on the victim .   
She uses it to take people out of the fight .   
If it affects you , do n’t do anything , or people that are n’t Trial and Error might get hurt .
” That got nods .
“
Two from Advance Guard are pursuing .   
We ’re going to go assist .
”
“
The sooner the better ?
”
Foxtrot asked .
“
Yeah , ” Capricorn said .
“ Lead the way , ” she said .   
“ I want to see how these guys pulled their concept together .
”
“ Tress and Antares are fast .   
The first responder types should follow them .   
Everyone else , with me , ” Capricorn gave the order .   
“ If you have questions , ask us , or call our phones .
”
I was in the air a moment later , heading toward the last known location .   
I gave Fume Hood a nod in passing .   
Sveta and I had four people with us-
two more who were able to get on a motorcycle or get in a vehicle within a few seconds of getting the go - ahead .   
The engines were already running , and they peeled out .
It became clear that our fastest moving members of the group were pulling away from the members at the rear .   
I turned around in the air , looking for Sveta , and I found her riding the roof of the rusted , post - apocalypse sedan that one cape had climbed into .
I gestured , and she thrwe out a hand , which I had to fly over to intercept and catch .   
She pulled herself to me , which made flying momentarily difficult , slowing the pull somewhat as she drew near .
“ I ’ll take the lead group , you take the stragglers ?
” I asked .   
“ I go left , circle around to eleven o’clock .   
You go right , two or three o’clock .   
Remember Capricorn will be coming in for their six like a battering ram .
”
“ I go left , ” she said .   
“
Look .   
Trees , taller buildings .   
That ’s my kind of terrain .
”
I nodded once , confirming .
She let go of me and pulled away with a force that was almost as intense as her arrival had been .
Foxtrot was one of the two in the lead .   
She did n’t teleport , exactly , but as I flew , I could see glimpses of her off to the side , below me , just ahead of me .
I ’d researched her , after she had ended up being a bit of a problem .   
Foxtrot and Houndstooth had dated for a bit- and potentially still were .   
It had been a thing early
and then the team had grown and that faded into the background .   
It said something that she ’d , despite the concerns of the girlfriend being promoted , despite the fact she had no apparent record or history of a hero until about a year ago … she ’d settled into a weird pseudo - leadership position , leading patrols a lot of the time .
For the moment , she was my ally in going up against the Trial & Error team .   
I had to consider her power ; on paper it was ‘ harassment repositioning’ .
She was speeding up .   
All at once , she was at a rooftop ledge just above and in front of me – ready to leap down on top of me , despite the considerable distance to the ground .   
As I flew closer to a rooftop to lower my profile , she was there , within arm
’s reach .   
I had a close - up view of her cute , smiling fox mask , bright costume with a crown and a chevron for the ‘ hill’ worked into the lapel and sleeve , just above a Gold Morning remembrance armband .   
Her hair was tied into a lopsided ponytail , and her hands rested on the rooftop ducts just in front of her .
Her power let her pick a target .   
Her not - quite - teleports would position her advantageously to catch them off guard .   
They were not - quite teleports because she did n’t appear out of nowhere so much as she was just there , ready , when the time came .
She picked out a target and her teleports centered on them .   
What was n’t on paper or available with a bit of research was the detail that she very clearly escalated .   
In speed , in proximity , in how there was an ever - improving edge that each location she or her power was picking seemed to offer .
Then , like a switch had been flicked , she broke away .   
The speed slowed and the target of focus changed to our companion .   
Something - kite .
I was willing to bet Foxtrot had a bit of a history as a cape , but not as a hero .   
The speed with which she ’d assumed a place on her team and the intensity I felt as she closed in on me made me think she was more experienced than her record with the Kings suggested .
We were pulling ahead .   
I could hear the tires as the trucks Prancer
’s hires were driving turned corners .
I pulled out my phone and plugged in the earbud to make a call to headquarters .   
It was n’t Chris that replied .
“
Heyy !
” Kenzie answered .
“
You ’re supposed to be home and in bed .
” Kenzie audibly scoffed .   
“
At eight o’clock at night ?   
When stuff is happening ?   
No .   
Do n’t be silly .   
Listen , I ’ve got the others in on conference , Swansong and
… we really need that one last code name .
”
“
Do n’t even ask , ” Rain said .   
“
The names I ’m
feeling are closest to right right now are terrible .   
For now , if you need to call me something , use Precipice .
”
“ Precipice , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Okay .   
A bit of a mouthful to shout in a big fight , but Antares and Victoria are both long words .
”
I expected Chris to say something about codenames or whatever .   
I noticed the silence .
“
Where ’s Cryptid ?
” I asked .
“
Gone , ” she said .   
“
He made the calls and then he left .
”
“
Okay .   
Can you give us eyes on things ?   
Cameras ?   
Specific locations on where these guys are , so we can close in ?
”
There was a pause .   
My phone started a video , then started chugging along , before seeming to stop .
“
One second , ” Kenzie said .   
“
You ’re outside of my setup .
”
Then the video started .
Trial , Error , a crowd of hirelings with guns –
there was no shortage of people looking for easier money , given the situation across the city .   
I saw other capes I could dimly recognize , too .   
Cleat .   
Etna .   
Crested .
“
Can you tell the others ?   
Three more capes , twenty hirelings ?   
I ’m going around the right side .
”
“
Got it .
”
I landed on a rooftop , striding forward at a slower speed than I ’d been flying .   
The intent was to buy myself a moment when-
There .   
A glimpse of Foxtrot .
“
Additional capes , guns , ” I said to the glimpse .   
Her head snapped around to look at me .   
“ Proper B - listers .
”
Her focus might have changed to me , because she recurred in my vicinity , as I continued forward on foot .
“
This is supposed to be the drop - off , ” I spoke my realization aloud .   
“ Spright and Shortcut are down there , making things difficult .   
I think Flapper is airborne here too .
”
I reached the rooftop
’s edge , looking across to where I could see the trucks – the people around those trucks were so small that I could n’t make out whether they were male or female .   
The coveralls did n’t help .   
Foxtrot appeared next to me , standing almost shoulder to shoulder with me , nose pointed out in the direction of those trucks and specks .
Kite landed beside me a second later .
“
What are you gunning for , with this strategy , pulling everyone in together ?
”
Foxtrot asked .
“
That ?   
Is it really the priority ?
”
“
No , ” Foxtrot said .   
She made an amused sound , “ But that is n’t , down there .   
Not until we have friends at our back or our side starts bleeding .   
What ’s this group thing ?
”
“
It ’s saying to hell with jurisdictions , ” I said .   
“
To hell with getting credit for one win or another .   
Coordinating to make sure we ’re all going after the ones who count .   
Sharing information .
”
“
Some like credit and having their own jurisdictions , ”
Kite ’s voice was quiet , almost guilty .   
“ Not me , but
I know people
and I do n’t think it will be that easy .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
Well , in an ideal world , I ’d like to do something here that would get us attention , enough that any abstainers would feel like they ’d need to join in if they wanted a share of the limelight .   
But that ’s all secondary .   
For now , we live and let live , and we fix what ’s broken .
”
“
Others are reaching you now , ” Kenzie reported through my phone .   
I missed Kite ’s response .
Sveta ’s group .
“ Tell them to hold back a second .   
How far behind is Cap ? ”
“
A few minutes .
”
Okay .
Shortcut and Spright were mostly evading at this point .   
They were n’t pushing in to attack , because Error did n’t let them do so without risk .   
They ’d draw in close , then pull away , leap onto something , wait until someone tried to come after them , and then move again .
The villains started to corner them , and Flapper made her appearance , diving down from above .   
She landed , and long clothes - wings extended out to sweep the legs out from under a whole crowd of mooks .   
Her sleeves raised up to become a barrier around her , a shield against incoming fire .
Then , with one herculean flap that drove people back with dust in their eyes , she took to the air again , weaving past the lights that illuminated the area and past power lines .   
She had to run alongside the edge of a building to reach the roof .
They did n’t have a lot of space to maneuver .   
The area was a loading bay to a large store , more or less a wide road without markings that sloped gently down to the bay doors that lined one wall of the brick building .   
Neither of the vans had made it to the bay doors , if that was even the goal- the wheels had been slashed .   
One had bumped up into a yellow - painted pillar , the front grille dented .
Round two .   
We could use what we ’d learned from the first round .   
The buildings opposite the row of loading bay doors looked residential , which was inconvenient .   
I could imagine the employees of the store lived there .
“ If we corner them , and we will corner them , ” I said .   
“ They ’ll threaten civilians again .   
Can your power get you inside to warn civilians , Fox ?
”
“
Only if I have someone else
I ’m
tracking that gets close .
”
“ I can get you close , ” Kite said .
“
Good , ” I said .   
“ Lookout , are you there ?
”
I heard her yawn .   
“
I wish I was there .   
But I ’m here .
”
“ We ’ll get you in the field , ” I pledged .   
“ Communicate with Sveta
, see if her contingent of capes has anyone who could help notify civilians and get them to evacuate .
”
Kite and Foxtrot slipped away .   
I gave them a wary look as they made their way to the ground , then around to what would be the ‘ front’ the residential complex , if the back of the building was what faced this loading area and fight .
My attention fixed on Spright and Shortcut .   
If they needed help- even if they were hit by something and fell , I was ready to fly to them .   
They ’d wanted to do this alone , they apparently felt capable .
They were evading , distracting , forcing Prancer ’s hires to deal with them .   
The trucks were disabled and the animals were within .   
The villains’ prize .
Thoughts flickered through my head .   
Of my mom telling me how that greed was a weakness .   
One of many lessons .   
Some , I felt , had contradicted others .   
I was divided on whether that was because they had , or if it was because I ’d been too young to properly digest , and what had n’t digested had warped slightly with time .   
What was right and what was wrong when hurting others .   
What school was supposed to be for me , given my inevitable career and lifestyle .   
Greed was a weakness and if the villains had something they prized then a lot could be done from standing between them and that prize .
That was what Spright and Shortcut were doing .
There were other thoughts .   
In trying to get my parents to talk about Amy , the Wretch had typed out one word , asking for the story we ’d never really gotten to hear in full .
M - A - R - Q - U - I - S.
My dad had told the tale .   
Somewhere in there
he ’d said something about Marquis’ prize-
Amy .   
I remembered because anything to do with Amy had been something to fixate on , back then .   
I remembered because there was something to the story that connected with what my mom had said , about the villains and their treasures .   
Connecting those dots had helped bring the already vivid mental picture of the scene to life .
Fuck me
, why was it that a memory about clarity and communication left me so painfully uneasy ?   
Beyond the fact that it was the Wretch in the scene , that the momentary peace I ’d felt only highlighted how brainwashed I was .
It was the communication itself -not the thing being communicated or the context- that gnawed at me and made me want to hit something and destroy it .
Kenzie ’s voice made me jump , and I was already on alert , watching to see if Spright or Shortcut got hurt .
“
You ’ve got a Cryptid inbound .   
Do n’t freak , ” Kenzie said , over the phone .
“
Do n’t freak ?
” I asked .   
“
He actually made it here ?
”
“ He flew .   
Then he switched forms- he warned me it was an awkward form , in case I saw on camera .   
And he yelled at me a lot about not watching him change , even though I would n’t ever do something that invades his privacy as badly as that .
”
“
Lookout .   
This form ?   
I ’m trying to keep control over this mess .   
I need all the details you can give me , and I need to know if we need to turn Cryptid away before he engages .
”
“
He does n’t usually use it because it ’s screwed up , ” she told me .   
“
That ’s all I know .
”
That was n’t helpful .
Way off in the distance , barely distinguishable from the spots in my vision , I could make out Sveta ’s unnaturally pale face .
On the roof of the residential building , I saw what had to be Cryptid ’s form .
A face -one reminiscent of a certain teenage boy - was cast in a hard white , shell - like substance , face twisted in anger , with lines drawn deeper and bumps drawn out as ridges .   
It was also , I had to notice , larger across than an unfolded umbrella .
A metal ring that reminded me of the external headwear for his braces stuck out of the mask and plunged into the side of his head , almost as if it was fixing the mask in place .   
Where his curly hair was usually pushed back by headphones , so hair was very close to head between brow and headphone band , the head of the form was striated slightly .
Definitely him .
He was big , built like a truncated caterpillar or tardigrade .   
His skin was translucent , but given the lighting , with only the loading bay below really lit , the translucence mostly meant that the inside seemed very dark and only the edges that had more material to catch the light really appeared as pale as they were .
With flight and an eye for timing things to avoid revealing myself to the people on the ground , I skipped about two hundred feet to get from my building to Cryptid ’s .
A caterpillar with a giant head , some shell , and short limbs that I could now see were bristling with weapons .   
Claws and growths like barnacles surrounded the lower limbs , giving them a great deal of character compared to the expanses of translucent flesh .
He raised a clawed ,    barnacle - crested hand in greetings .
Discs mounted on his two frontmost shoulders flickered on .
Projections of Ashley and Rain .
Here with us in spirit ?   
Or would they struggle through bad latency and being outside of Kenzie ’s service area ?
A masked Swansong walked with her hands clasped behind her back to get to the rooftop
’s edge .   
Depending on how the light hit her , her hologram nature would be more or less apparent .
Precipice , short - haired and only wearing a machine mask over his face , stepped back and looked up at Cryptid .
“
You ’re one weird guy , ” Precipice said .
Cryptid put a clawed hand out .   
It waggled in a so - so gesture .
“ Cryptid , ” I said .   
“
You ’re weird as fuck .
”
He shook his head , made the gesture again .
“
It ’s not the weird part , ” Precipice said .   
“
He ’s saying … iffy on the one ?   
Or on the guy part .
”
That last one got an affirmative nod from Cryptid .
Cryptid stretched , craning his body to one side .   
Translucent body distended , and insides pushed up against the skin .
In those insides , with the dim light , I could faintly make out dark shapes .   
Misshapen skulls with almost circular mask - like faces at the front filled whole tracts of his insides .   
Some had rings running through them like the greater form did , but at different angles and in different places .   
As I looked , the skulls moved .
Tiny hands pressed up against the sides of his tardigrade body .   
Dozens of them .
I found myself squirming , just seeing it .   
They were sharp fingers , too .   
They pushed at his flesh and the points threatened to cut through , spilling out the contents .
“
No , no , no , no , no , ” Precipice said .   
“
No .   
No , sorry .   
Call me if you need me .
”
With that , the projection winked out of existence .   
The camera that had been floating where the head was returned to Cryptid ’s shoulder .
“ Cryptid , ” I said .   
“
This form-
”
“ Heads up !
” Kenzie reported .   
I heard a voice in the background .   
“
Okay , no , not you .   
My team !   
Heads up !   
Capricorn is just now arriving and he ’s wanting to blitz right away .   
Give him reasons not to
or he ’s going to jump in .
”
There was no reason not to let him jump in .   
He knew well enough not to attack Error , with the risk .
I was ready to fly
in-
my feet momentarily left the ground , before finding it again .   
I turned to Cryptid .
“
Do not , under any , any circumstance , give birth to whatever those things are .   
Not on this battlefield .
”
He bristled , puffing up .
“ We need this to go well , ” I said .   
“ Please .
”
He shifted position , bringing his rear end forward , settling down into the slouching kind of sit that some dogs and cats managed , when their construction did n’t normally allow for that degree of slouch .
Settling in to do nothing , it seemed .
I left it at that , because I had to .   
I gave Swansong a small smile as I passed her .
I saw Etna reacting with a measure of panic as the heroes came in .   
She backed up toward the loading bay door where there was more cover , separating herself from the other villains and their mooks .
There were guns , but guns drew attention .   
It was attention from Fume Hood , who gassed the heaviest concentrations , attention from me .
Calm , collected .   
If we were going to pull this off-
We had to do this right .
I hated how much I sounded like my mother in my own head , when I thought that .
The effect on the scene was little different from the old cowboy movies , when the convoy passed through a valley , only for the valley entrances and exits to be blocked , rocks pushed over .   
In those scenes , the attackers appeared at the fringes , on either side of the valley , attacking from established , fortified positions .
So it was here .   
Attacks from alleys and from rooftops .   
They were surrounded .
Cleat balled up into a mass of spiked armor , then moved all at once , with a speed that surprised me .
Not him .   
It was n’t his power .
The path he traveled had a logic to it-
it was n’t a straight line .   
It was a curve .
Nearly invisible in the gloom , with no lights shining on that specific area , Trial had thrown chain to Cleat , and now Cleat was his wrecking ball .
Massive , crushing swings raked through building faces and toward the good guy capes .
Cleat came around again , whipcrack fast .
This time I was the focus of the strike .   
It came at me , and I knew I would n’t have time to run .
In that same moment , Error hit me .
Even an accidental deflect could send that wrecking ball into ten or more people , with how Error ’s power worked .
I tried to fly out of the way , and I knew I could n’t .
A hand at my shoulder adjusted my flight path .   
A yank pulled me away from the human - sized flail .   
I landed on my back , the impact traveling through my arm to the bullet wound .   
Concrete below me , Sveta knelt above me .   
the sky was dark , and it smelled like violence .   
People approached , coming after me .
Fume Hood lurked nearby , her hands out , three shiny spheres the size of billiard balls floating around her hands .   
She let them fly their courses , each one rocketing into a dense collection of the villains before detonating into a cloud of gas .
Error was focused on someone else again , no heavy pressure settling around me .   
It freed me to deal with Cleat .   
Foxtrot was closing in around Trial , but her ability to appear at random or at strategic points close by her target did n’t really jibe with the fact that Trial was swinging his teammate around him , clearing a forty - foot radius around himself of anyone with any measure of self preservation .
I rose up into the air , ready to meet it .
I had one shot , for best effectiveness .   
I watched as the wrecking ball made its rotation , hit a wall , and then bounced off with almost more momentum than before .
He was manipulating the chain to make it so Cleat could be swung , keeping it out of my reach .
Foxtrot closed in on him , narrowing her range for harassment .   
One appearance to his left , ducking beneath the swinging chain .   
She kicked him in the back of the leg , then the small of his back .   
She had a weapon in
hand-
She was elsewhere .   
Swinging- And stopping .   
Errors influence , no doubt .   
Foxtrot could n’t follow through without danger .
Balance found , back now straight , he swung the Cleat - ball in one rotation , counter - clockwise .   
A second rotation .   
A thir- Cleat hurtled toward me as Trial used other chains to lunge in my direction , putting the flail on course to hit me .
This time my timing was right- no confusing changes in direction .   
Just hitting that cape - turned - weapon with everything I had , aura - wise .
Cleat uncurled , yet still flew toward me .   
He ’d lost his grip on the chain .   
He ’d carry forward , bounce off of things , and maim or kill everyone he contacted .
I threw up the wretch , and I caught him , full - bodied , the Wretch ’s arms , the Wretch ’s chest and faces .   
The impact made a sound that was almost enough to deafen me .   
The spikes scraped against my armor on their way down .
He hit the ground , tried to rise up , and then stumbled , landing on hands and knees .
Etna , having retreated , was now faced with a huge numbers disadvantage , with no help from her peers .   
A surrender .
Crested was a mix of offense and defense , but he was up against capes who were pure offense or pure defense .   
Fume Hood blasted him , and as our guys backed away to safer ground that was free of the noxious gas , Crested had no such option .
But Trial and Error- that was a team that was tough to crack .
People closed in , but we had dealt some damage to ourselves , thanks to Error .   
Nobody wanted to be the next to hurt a friend or alienate a potential ally with an attack turned the wrong way .
“
We had this , ” Shortcut said , behind me .
“
You still have it , ” I said , watching Error and Trial .   
“
It ’s yours .
”
“ We might not be able to beat them , but they ’ll have a hell of a time fighting us , ” Shortcut said .   
“
They go to any contacts , any place they think is safe
, we ’re on them .   
They want to go home ?   
We ’ll be after them .   
We will win because they- because crime does not have a place in this world .
I felt that crime as a whole was taking root too easily to be so easily dismissed .   
That we could n’t deal with Trial and Error was another problem .
We had the power , but not the means to use it .
“
Cryptid is saying he could climb to a point above them and unload his cargo on their heads .   
Nonlethal , ” Kenzie reported , over coms .
“
Let ’s not , ” Capricorn said , within earshot of me .
Sveta joined us .
Above us , Cryptid crawled along rooftops , peering down .   
Beside us , Spright was talking to Shortcut .
We had them cornered , but there was no way to follow through .   
Not when Error could turn a simple action like an execution - style shot , into something more risky for someone in the area .
I glanced at the damaged residential buildings .   
Not a soul , no lights , all dark .   
It looked like we ’d evacuated fine
– the contents of rooms exposed to the world looked fairly fine .
“ Just take the vans away and they lose , ”
I said .
At my statement , some people headed to the overlong vans , climbing into the driver ’s seats .
If they wo n’t fight alongside us , we ’ll take away the rewards and satisfaction .
One of the trucks started up .
Trial rose up , using chains to climb .   
Sveta grabbed two .   
Capricorn created his motes .   
Chris-
he burbled , I supposed .
I checked the coast was clear , and then I brought the Wretch out .
The associated emotions were heavy , a weight on my shoulders .   
But he lashed out and I deflected .   
I felt
Error
’s
power take hold of me and dodged instead of fighting back , and I felt a measure of triumph as someone else took my place on the defensive line .
We were working more as a collective now .   
Trading off , being aggressive , being different , without judgment .   
This was what I wanted this organization to be .   
It would take tuning .
I slowly turned up my aura while I stared down Trial .   
Error was in the background , ready to act , but she was n’t sticking anything on me because I was n’t doing anything .   
Not as far as she could tell-
my aura did n’t reach her .
I stared down Trial .   
The second truck started up .   
Both started to make their limping way away from the scene .   
Trial wore a metal mask that covered the upper half of his face and some of his chin .   
It exposed enough that I could see his expression change , as his prize drove away .
He could fight us and do okay at it , but it was mostly a stalemate , as long as he and Error were the tag team they were supposed to be .    
Like this , however , he got nothing .
People like him would get nothing .
“
Fine , ” he said .   
“ You win .
”
“
Thank you , ” I replied , as coldly as I was able .   
The audience watched with careful eyes .   
One or two might have had phones out to gather evidence , now switched to video mode to track anything particular .
“ You got the cargo .   
Let us go .
”
“ Not going to happen , ” Capricorn answered .
“
You ca n’t beat us , not without paying a price , ” Trial growled .
“ If you want to pull an all - nighter , ” Shortcut said , “ I think we ’ll have more friends turning up than you will .   
You lost already .   
Anything more is theater .
”
“
Oh , but I do like theater , ” Spright said .
Shortcut and Spright were taking point now .   
It was technically their arrest , and I did n’t care about jurisdiction .   
I cared about word of mouth .
“
This is what you ’re wanting to do more regularly ?
”
Sveta asked me , her voice quiet .   
“
It ’s not bad , but
… ”
“
This .   
But more , ” I said .   
“
Bigger targets , bigger numbers , more focus .
”
I saw her nod .
“
Which part are you nodding at ?
”
“ Targets , ” she said .   
“ Focus .   
Mainly targets .   
There are too many dangerous people out there who need to be put down or dealt with .
”
Others who ’d been lurking at the periphery were making their appearances .   
We had our own cheats there .   
Our two projections .   
Chris .   
The perimeter guard was now working to pressure the villains .
They had nowhere to go .   
They were outnumbered ten to one .   
They could fight and they could make the arrests hurt , but there would be costs .
We ’d won .   
They would cave before anything else .   
I ’d use my power again in a moment .
For now , we ’d let them be stubborn .
“ You want bigger ?
” Capricorn asked .
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“ ‘ Bigger’ can mean different things , ” Rain said .








There was a growing feeling of satisfaction as people got underway with their days and messages started coming in .   
Steelmasons were starting patrols near the devastated old Wardens HQ .   
Auzure was resuming business as normal , but as they got things done they hoped to be able to spare their people .   
Shorewatch was just setting up at their HQ-
they ’d been on a break since the portal attack and were just getting into the swing of things .
Shorewatch ’s situation was n’t so dissimilar from us .   
We ’d taken a break to reel , to attend to our individual group members .   
Sveta , Tristan and I were in headquarters early in the day , the place was clean , and the whiteboards that had been wiped clean were filling up again .
More messages , and it was a two - for - one this time .   
Rushdown and Royale were reporting in .   
They were n’t a team so much as they were a pair , but they operated from the same area of the city as Houndstooth ’s Kings .   
They ’d emailed a report they were starting their day closer to noon , with the intent of going after some people who had been trying to stir up riots .   
There was an outside chance those people were Cheit ’s provocateurs .   
They also included a report on behalf of the Kings of the Hill .
Houndstooth had n’t mentioned that he ’d be doing that , but I could understand it , kind of .   
One degree of separation .   
Lookout could n’t hack people .   
This enabled his team to communicate with us without discomfort .
I saw the first message from people that had n’t been at the meeting .   
They had n’t used the email format I ’d requested , and they called themselves The Major Malfunctions .   
There were also several glaring typos , to the point I was suspicious that non - capes or villains had found our word - of - mouth setup and were toying with us .
A painfully slow search online brought up some images of kid heroes with terrible costumes .   
They ’d been small timers before Gold Morning , small town ‘ heroes’ who ’d rotated between three middle - of - nowhere towns in North Dakota looking for villains or criminals .   
Four years of activity
and they had n’t found any .
It would have been easy to dismiss them , or to disparage them .   
They had dropped out of school to be heroes and had no wins .   
The lack of education was clear in the spelling errors .   
It worried me a bit that their referral had come from ‘ Super Magic Dream Parade’ , the loopy team from Boston , who had apparently heard about what we were doing and passed on word .
The Major Malfunctions were teenagers now and they ’d been kids when they ’d triggered .   
They ’d stayed heroes across six years , and they ’d stayed together .
That had to count for something .
I took a minute to fix the errors and formatting , then dragged the email over to the tracking program .   
It was the same program the Patrol Block had used , but I ’d filed off the serial numbers and gone into the code to change the names of some labels .
I sent them a reply .   
We ’d use their help if they were free .
I was n’t even done with looking over the next entry when the Majors replied , excited and incomprehensible .
“
How ’s it going ?
” Tristan asked .   
He stood by a whiteboard .   
It looked like he was sketching out the prison complex .   
He ’d worn the non - armor part of his costume beneath his jacket , and now had the skintight top and jeans .   
It was n’t the textured pattern of the usual under - the - armor bodysuit , which would allow the texture to peek through the gaps between armor .   
It was just black .
He ’d painted his hair again , though .   
Orange - red .   
Stiff rolls , curls and waves locked in place with glue - like hair product .
“ We ’re getting responses .   
People are talking about what they ’re doing , they ’ll fill us in if they get answers and they ’ll open it up to the rest of us if they end up with questions .   
Do you know these kids , uh , Major Malfunctions ?
”
“
No , ” he said .
“ Sveta ?
” I asked .
“
Hm ?
” she looked up from her computer .
She looked nice .   
Beaded necklaces were looped around and below the more rigid part of the collar that was her neck .   
Her top was a very summery sort , a hooded crop - top that was torn , not cut , at the neck and sleeves .   
Tan with a bold blue - green lizard on it .   
Her pants were a little less loose and casual than her usual .   
Her wig was brushed and her tattoo at her cheek was left uncovered by makeup .
She ’d gone shopping .   
A selfish part of me felt left out-
I would ’ve wanted to take her shopping , do that as a thing together , but Tristan had prodded her to talk about what was making her feel awkward , and clothes and body were apparently off the table .
Just business and safe topics then .   
“
I wanted to ask if you were familiar with Major Malfunctions ?   
They ’re a team .
”
“
I do n’t know them .
”
“
Okay .   
They ’re hard to get a read on .   
Zero experience despite putting in the years .   
Odd histories .
” She nodded .
“
Everything okay ?
”
“
Yeah , heard from an old acquaintance , that ’s all , ” Sveta said , giving me a tight smile .   
She had to work her fingers into the right position before hitting the key combination to take her computer to the log - in screen .   
She shut the computer .
Not
yeah ,
I thought .
“ We can talk about it if you want .
”
“
Let me digest it first , ” she said .   
“ Catch me up ?
”
She and I both walked over to the point roughly between my setup and Tristan
’s .
“
I ’m thinking about the prison , ” Tristan said .   
He stabbed a marker at the series of squares and lines that depicted the prison .   
“
To get there , you have to travel to one portal , which is about twenty - five minutes away from the city , and then you have to travel for another twenty minutes to get to the next portal .   
That one ’s where the guards and security are .   
That ’s without the time it takes to reach the first portal .   
It ’s deliberately set out of reach .   
What are our options ?
”
I folded my arms .   
“
The obvious option is that we enable Kenzie because she ’s exactly what we need in this situation , we exacerbate her issues and ignore problematic behavior , and we regret it down the road .
”
“ Obvious but not ideal , ” Sveta said .
“ We have reason to believe they ’re watching- which would be hard , or they infiltrated the prison with the aim of going after Goddess-
we assumed staff .
”
“ They have more ability to communicate with the outside world than prisoners do , ” Sveta said .   
“
Though they did let Rain and Ash have laptops and phone access .
”
“ Limited , ” Tristan added , “ And monitored .
”
“ Code ? ”
Sveta asked .
“ Could be , ” I said .   
“
But staff seems more likely .   
Staff can drug , make promises , open doors , manipulate .
”
Sveta nodded , her eyes widening .   
“
It ’s scary to think about .   
Remember how vulnerable people were at the hospital ?   
If someone had caught me at the wrong time with a few kind words , I could have believed anything .   
I think some of the Irregulars fell into that trap .
”
“
Okay , ” Tristan said .   
“
We keep an eye on the staff ?
” I shook my head .
“
No
? ”
“
The question is n’t whether we do .   
I think it makes sense .   
The question is if we can do it while keeping Kenzie out of trouble .   
We need to do this surveillance without handing a ridiculous amount of work to
an eleven year old that ’s already prone to overworking herself .
”
“ Agreed , ” Sveta said .   
“
Did we make any contacts that might be able to help with thinker powers ?
”
“ I ca n’t think of any big ones from the people who replied already , but we ’re getting a lot of responses and it ’s only , what , nine ?
”   
I got a nod of confirmation and carried on , “ The prison being isolated is a double - edged sword .   
The staff need to sleep , they have families , homes to go back to , and they have commutes .
”
“ If they ’re out of reach at the prison , we get them when they ’re elsewhere , ” Tristan said .   
“
See if they arrange any meetings .
”
I smiled a little .   
“
Yeah .
”
“
It ’s a lot of people , ” Sveta said .   
“
And you want to do it without Kenzie ?
”
“ If we ’re going to make her happy or find a safe way for her to hero , for both workload and this frontline role she really wants , I do n’t think it ’ll involve her maintaining a thousand surveillance operations .
”
“
So we have a thousand surveillance operations to manage some other way ?
” Tristan asked .
I could n’t help but notice the way he ’d asked it .   
Was he disappointed that I was trying to steer us away from leaning on our tinker ?
“
We ’ve got some responses .   
We can whittle down the list , rule some people out .
”
“ Who do we have ?
” he asked .
I led them over to my computer , showing them the program and the responses .
One of the most powerful parahumans we know of on one side , a hostile and nebulous force on the other , and a prison filled with some of the most irredeemable and unfortunate of us in the middle .
I went over the people I ’d already seen the responses from , from the Steelmasons to the Major Malfunctions , and I was just getting into the message from Dream Parade when the fire escape rattled .
Our kid team members .   
They were noisy as they let themselves in , because they were mid - argument .   
Natalie was a short distance behind them .   
She ducked her head in a kind of greeting - apology , lingering at the door .
Kenzie ’s hair was n’t in the two buns , but was instead parted to one side , glossy and still with the pin .   
Today was a blue heart day , it seemed .   
She wore a blue sweater - dress with a glittery texture , pink tights , and a pink shirt with a folded collar that poked through the collar of her sweater .
Chris , by contrast , looked a little worse for wear , with circles under his eyes .   
Under his jacket , he wore a horizontally - striped shirt of black and green .   
He wore torn jeans and a leather fanny pack .   
It was the kind of nice fanny pack that suggested maybe a nod toward fashion or a kind of effort , but it was a fanny pack .   
They were never going to be cool .
Where Kenzie had adjusted her hair , Chris was in usual form – the external rigging for his braces , and the headphones with the bar of the headphones pushing the hair at the top of his head flat against his scalp , so the curls only really went wild at the back .   
Pockets were full , the fanny pack was full , and he carried a bag heavy enough that his usual slouch was worse .
Natalie , meanwhile , wore the jacket I ’d seen her in before , as well as a black button - up under a gray business jacket , with black slacks .   
If the belt had n’t also been black , it would ’ve worked nicely .   
Her forehead creased in worry .
I beckoned for her to come in .   
She had to edge past the two younger members of the group .
“ You can do the costume thing !
”
Kenzie was saying .   
“ Not just stealing my camo .   
I have to recharge that stuff .
”
“
The costume thing you ’re talking about would be exactly the same .
”
“
But it would be your costume , not my camo .
”
“ That does n’t make sense , ” Chris said .   
To us , he said .   
“
She does n’t make sense .
”
“ I do n’t make sense ?   
Do you want to share with the class what you told me when I had to go looking for you at the train station ?
”
“ We were late , ” Chris said .   
“
I had a health issue .   
I do n’t know what her excuse is .
”
“
The people who are looking after me hogged the bathroom !   
I did n’t even get to do my hair !
”
“
I can talk to them , ” Natalie said .
“
It ’s fine , mostly .   
I could deal if I could just adjust , but it ’s different people or mixes of people with different ways of doing stuff , ” Kenzie said .   
“
You ca n’t talk to them about that .   
It ’s just the way it is .
”
“
I ’ll talk to them about mixing schedules , ” Natalie said .   
“
This is solvable .
” Kenzie nodded .
“
Your hair looks nice , ” I said .
“
Thank you .   
It makes me feel anxious .   
Anyway !   
I got to the station late and he was off in my direction , so we were going to catch the train together , but he was n’t there .   
And he comes out of the bathroom and-
”
“
You asked if I wanted to share with the class , and I ca n’t get five words out before the digressions and you start telling the story for me .
”
“ You were n’t telling !   
And , um , if you ’re not comfortable telling , that ’s
okay .   
But if you are and you ’re slinging mud at me instead , I ’m just going to tell it .
”
“
I ’ll tell it , ” he said .   
“
Apparently taking on a form with a thousand and five hundred angry foetal grubs crammed inside it gets messy .   
I changed back to normal , but I guess the foetal grubs did n’t all vacate .   
I had a slurry of their bits in my guts .
”
I could see Natalie visibly pale .
“
That ’s a good reason to not use that form again , ” Capricorn said .   
“ That was horrifying .
”
“
It ’d be fine if I ’d evacuated while I was still Brooding Anger , ” Chris said , giving me a look .   
“
But I was told not to .   
By someone who is n’t really official leader .
”
I was careful as I articulated myself , “
A thousand grubs inside you .   
They had fangs and claws- ”
“
Technically they were part human , part grub .   
I think .
”
“ You said they were nonlethal , ” I said .   
I frowned .   
“ Chris , I do n’t believe you .
”
“
They would have listened to me , after , ” Chris said .   
“ I think ?   
Instinctual listening .
” I shook my head .   
“
No . ”
“
No sounds good , ” Natalie echoed me , her voice soft .
“
Let ’s not terrorize people too much , ” Tristan said .   
“ That thing was horrifying .
”
“ That thing was me .   
Anyway , I ’m done talking about this .
”
He tossed his bag onto the table by his favorite chair , then removed the fanny pack .   
It joined the bag .
He gave me a hard look when we made eye contact .   
With everyone going to their workstations , only Sveta and I lingering , I opted not to bug Chris .
I headed over to talk to Kenzie .   
Natalie followed , because safeguarding Kenzie was her job .   
It seemed like a conflict of interest , given our prior arrangement , but I imagined the pool of people who could be told Kenzie ’s identity as Lookout was narrow , and the system was overloaded .
“
Sorry to hear your caretakers left you frazzled , ” I said .
“
They ’re super nice , and I trust them , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I think whenever hero stuff comes up , they do n’t know what to do , so they give up .   
It ’s like in books
when a girl says she has woman troubles and the adult guy gets flustered and gives her whatever she wants , except I do n’t think that happens in real life .   
How do you end up forty and not know basic stuff ?
”
“ Uh huh , ” I said .   
“
There was a seventeen year old in my Patrol Block who did n’t know the ordering of the alphabet after T.    You ’d be surprised .
”
“
Well , it seems problematic to not know how hero and villain stuff works , ” Kenzie said .
“ I do n’t think anyone knows , ” Natalie said .
“
The basics , though , ” Kenzie said , as she typed at her keyboard .   
“
Is it okay if I bring Rain and Ash over here ?
”
“ Bring ? ”
Natalie asked .
“ Projections , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Basically a prettied up video call .   
It lets them be here , even though they ’re really over there looking at their laptops .
”
“
It ’s fine , ” I said .
Kenzie nodded enthusiastically .   
She began working .
Two cameras came to life .   
They floated to different heights above the ground .   
Then the dark sides of the big projector box came to life , and the images appeared , frozen in space .
“ When you said projections , I thought they ’d be see - through or flickering , ” Natalie said .   
“
They look real .
”
“
Almost , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Calling .
”
There was a beep , and Rain ’s projection started moving .   
The physical movements below the neck were fairly generic , but the faces seemed true to life .
“ I wish I had a better idea of what my body was doing , ” Rain said .
“ Welcome to my life , ” Sveta said .
“ I ca n’t tell if you ’re joking .   
If you ’re not , I ’m really sorry .
”
“
I ’m
joking , do n’t worry , ” she said .   
“ Dark joke , but hey . ”
Ashley ’s projection took on a semblance of life .   
She looked around .
Tristan was the one who started us off .   
“
People are interested .   
We ’re lining up help , and what we ’re thinking is we ’ll use that help to track prison staff when they ’re outside of the prison- especially those who are making suspicious movements .   
Any clues you can give us help .
“
This kind of tracking sounds extreme , ” Natalie said .
I answered , “ Standard cop - style surveillance .   
Lots of waiting .   
No peeking in windows , no trespassing on property .   
If they go for a drive late at night , we have a flier or speedster track them .   
Maybe thinkers poke their heads in .
”
“ Okay , ” Natalie said .   
She considered for a moment .   
“
How do you enforce this if it ’s hired help ?
”
“ If they screw around or bend the rules , we cut them off , ” Ashley said .
“
That , ” I said .   
“
We have reason to think the prison is compromised .   
The big heroes know about it , but we ’re in an awkward position .   
It ’s like trying to deal with someone planning on crashing a plane .   
It ’s a lot harder to get them when they ’re out of reach .   
If we can get them on the ground , though-
”
“ You fly , ” Rain said .
“
It ’s an allegory , Rain , ” Sveta said .   
“
I ’d punch you in the arm if you were here .
”
“
Anything you guys can give us helps , ” I said .   
“
Starting points , ways to narrow down who we ’re looking at .
”
“
I talked to Crystalclear , ” Rain said .   
“ I tried , anyway , he was n’t down for it .   
I said I knew you , and you ’d fought together at the community center , but he did n’t believe me .
”
“ Makes sense , ” Chris said .   
“
You could be a thinker .   
Or an anything .   
If he was a hero , he might have enemies .
”
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .
I mused for a second before saying , “
I visited Fume Hood at the hospital , Tempera and Crystalclear were there .   
Later that night , I had Tempera help me with a kid in crisis –
she would have told Crystalclear .   
The kid ended up going to Europe .   
He should be able to confirm where we ’re at , then see what he has to say .
” “ Got it , ” Rain said .
“
I have something too ,
” Ashley said .   
“ Goddess is interested in the prison .   
Did you read her messages ?
”
“
No , ” Tristan said .   
“
There ’s no written record .   
She ’s doing it through her people , who call or visit , because her actually showing up would be as good as an act of war .   
There are some notes here and there , for paperwork , and we can see emails going out asking for arbitration or help .   
She ’s been interested since before the portal debacle , and she ’s been getting impatient .
”
“ I got part of it , ” Ashley said .   
“
I had words with Monokeros .   
She mentioned this woman –
must we call her Goddess ?
”
“ We must n’t , ” Sveta said .   
“
The woman in blue .   
The Dictator of Shin .
”
“
Calling her a dictator would be giving her too much respect .   
This blue woman reached out to Monokeros .   
It ’s part of why she wants to come here .   
She wants her , and she wants some specific others- all of us
, I ’m sure , if she can get us , but she was apparently asking if the Mathers bitch was at this prison .
”
“ Shit , ” Rain said .   
“
No .   
Mama Mathers ?
”
“
Yes , ” Ashley said .
“
She wants mind controllers ?
” I asked .
“
She might not have control over Shin , ” Sveta said .   
“
She has this power that makes capes willing to serve her-
”
“ One of her many powers , ” I added .
“
But she was pulled out of her world just like everyone else .   
Her lieutenants were pulled out of her world .   
No more capes to control things –
we do n’t know how the population reacted .
”
“ Riots , ” Chris said .   
“
It ’d have to be .
”
“
She ca n’t go back until she has the means of seizing control .   
She has n’t come after Gimel to take that because … ” Sveta trailed off .
“
She ’s missing something , ” I said .   
“
Or she was injured in the final fight , or …
there ’s some stipulation on how her powers work or how she maintains a balance where she ’s a multitrigger like Rain but with top tier powers across the board .
”
“
Or , ” Capricorn said .   
“
She knows it would mean war between her world and ours , and we have more capes .   
Her civilians might outnumber our civilians , but they hate her .   
There ’s no loyalty .   
She took over her world and it was a hostile occupation .
”
“ I was wearing the eye camera , ” Ashley said .   
“
I talked to Monokeros after I said goodnight to Kenzie .   
You did n’t watch ?
”
“
No , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Should I have ?
”
“ Do n’t , ” Ashley said .   
“
Pretend it does n’t exist , as a favor to me .   
Someone else in the group should watch it .   
Sveta , I trust you .   
Victoria .   
But not Chris or Kenzie .
”
“
I ’m being lumped in as one of the kids now ?
” Chris asked .   
“
If I had n’t been strongarmed into keeping my womb to myself last night , I ’d have kids .   
Probably .   
I think some of the hardier ones would have lasted .
”
I saw Natalie suppress a shiver .
“
It ’s private , and I ’m saying no .
”
“ I do n’t like being left out , ”
Kenzie was quiet as she said it .
“ Please .   
I ’ll make it up to you , ” Ashley said .
“ Make it up to me by getting out of prison sooner , ” Kenzie said .
“
Okay .   
I ’ll try .
”
“
Keep doing what you ’re doing , guys , ” Tristan said .   
“ Twist Crystalclear ’s ear , Rain .   
Ashley , we ’ll watch your video .   
Victoria was showing us a list of the people who ’ve showed interest lately .
”
“ I think the other heroes are discouraged and frustrated too , ” Sveta said .   
“
It ’s been a long time since we did n’t have the PRT or the Wardens as a thing we could turn to .   
They want a way to fill that void .
”
“
We ’re not a replacement for the Wardens and we ’re definitely not a replacement for the Protectorate , ”
I said , firm .   
“ I do n’t want to be that .   
It would be a complete and utter disaster .   
I want to change the rules we ’re playing by .
”
“
We ’ll try it , ” Tristan said .   
“
I ’ve got , hm , nineteen minutes before I need to switch out .   
We divvy up people and groups and give them direction , Lookout- Kenzie , can you queue up the video for Rain , Sveta , Victoria and me ?   
Then maybe use that program we had in Hollow Point .   
Not listening in on anyone directly , but tracking keywords and phrases .
”
“ Goddess , prison ?
” Kenzie asked .
“
What do you think ?
”
Tristan asked Natalie .
“ I feel nervous saying yes to several things in a row , ” Natalie said .
“
Are we reasonably sound here ?
”
“
Let me look at the list of words you come up with after .
”
“
Great .   
Chris ?   
Take it easy , we ’ll have you running errands later .   
And if you have to go , find a discreet place in nature to do it .   
I do n’t want you destroying our toilet by filling it with tiny bones or whatever .
”
“
I can feel the love , ” Chris said .
“ I like you fine , ” Tristan replied .   
“ I like our security deposit too .
”
“ Everyone has their tasks , ” Ashley said .
“
Mine ’s apparently to not shit in the toilet , ” Chris said .
“
Yours is to wait , conserve energy , be ready to change to something convenient so you can go talk to people or run recon , and stop being a nuisance , ” Ashley said .
“
Yeah , alright , ” Chris said .   
“
I ’m going to go for a walk to find a spot of nature
so I wo n’t have any distractions later .   
Maybe it ’ll get me closer to normal sooner .
”
“
Good luck , ” Kenzie said .
As the group broke apart , there was immediate decision - making to be had .   
Sveta wanted to go talk to the misfits , individuals , and the ones who seemed more like the ‘ true blue’ types .   
It seemed like a fair balance , difficult misfits and easier heroes .
For Capricorn and I , it was a question of who we thought we could get along with or communicate with more easily .   
Some consideration was given to the fact I could fly and Capricorn had to travel a route on foot .
Kenzie had found the footage of Monokeros .   
As she moved through different areas of the apartment and Ashley
’s activities therin , there were glimpses .   
Black haired , pretty , with numerous tattoos , with the most prominent being a bold triangle at her forehead .
The image stopped at a short - haired Ashley looking in the mirror , hands resting on the table just beneath that mirror .
“
That ’s fine , ” I heard Ashley tell Kenzie .
“
I ’m going to go get stuff together , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Keep me company ?
”
“
Of course .
”
Sveta and Tristan put down what they were doing to approach Kenzie ’s workstation .   
The image of Rain was already nearby .   
I hit the spacebar .
Audio levels fluctuated as Ashley went from being on pause to moving .
The rooms were basic , built without much flourish and with basic materials .   
They had to be new , yet the floorboards creaked as Ashley walked .   
Her other half was in the kitchen , standing by two cups of tea- styrofoam cups , teabags still in .
She took her tea with a simple “ thank you
” and carried it out to the balcony .
I appreciated the view the eye - camera gave us .   
A glimpse of the prison from a higher point of view .   
I had n’t been able to go up by the visitation rules .   
No thinker 1 power for me .
Ashley ’s head turned .   
She looked down at the next balcony – a floor below , as close to the corner of the building as it could be without turning a right angle .
Monokeros .   
As glimpsed in the rewind .
“
You tested me , Monokeros , ” Ashley said .
“ Monokeros , ” the woman replied .   
“
It ’s always Monokeros .   
You can call me Kathlee .
”
“
I ’m not going to do that .
”
“ You could even win points if you called me Unicorn .
”
“
I ’m not interested in your points , Monokeros .   
You know what you did .   
Another person might report you to the authorities for the use of your power .
” Monokeros snickered .   
“
You ’d be a rat .   
That gets you in trouble with Llorona .   
It puts you on the bad side of everyone here .   
No , you have to be smarter than that .
”
“ I know .   
I have acquaintances , and I have very poor impulse control .   
You should know that every time you get close to me , there ’s a chance I ’ll come for you .   
From now on , if we ’re in the yard , you keep your distance from me .   
If I come near you , you ’ll scramble to get out of the way .   
If you ’re sitting , you ’ll stand and walk away .
”
“ If you try anything , you ’ll hurt more than I do , ” Monokeros said .
“ If I try anything , your existence will end .   
You ’re a child killer , Monokeros .   
You have no clout .
”
“
Do n’t they say that if someone lives on in our hearts , they ’re still with us ?   
They say it when a family member dies , but when you use my diplomatic pull ability , draw them in , take them apart with delicacy , never sullying them , but working with an eye for beauty … and then watch the light go out of their eyes , slowly , slowly , slowly , ” Monokeros luxuriated in her own words .   
“ Mm .   
If you hold that moment more dear in your heart than any parent could hold onto the memories of their child , no , you ’re a murderer .   
It ’s death this time , the idea of holding onto memories is some kind of falsehood all of a sudden because the child is gone .   
Hypocrisy .
”
“ You call it diplomatic pull ?   
No , Monokeros .   
You ’re pathetic in every sense of the word .
”
“ I could do it to you now , if the monitor would n’t blow up , ” Monokeros said .   
She backed away and shook one foot .   
“
You ’d adore me .   
I ’d see glimpses of you as a person , more as time passed , until I understood you fundamentally .   
And even if you managed to push away the feeling of adoration for long enough to do something … you ca n’t touch me .
”
“
It ’s an inane name , it does n’t fit your theme .
”
“
Someone else disagrees , you know .   
I ’ve had brief exchanges with her .   
Promises were made .   
She would make me something better , housemate .   
Higher class , wealthy , and she promised me an infinite supply of my drug of choice .
”
“ I do n’t believe you .   
Communications do n’t come and go that freely .
”
Monokeros made an amused sound .
“ Keep your fictional Goddess close then , and scramble to stay out of my way .
”
“ She ’ll save you too .   
She ’ll save all of us .   
Those who served her before she had that control will live lives of luxury .
”
“
You ’d be her slaves .   
That ’s her power .
”
“
I ’d be her slave
and I ’d be beautiful beyond compare .   
She has a lieutenant who creates pods .   
Sensory deprivation and plastic surgery in one .   
She ran a whole world , and she ’ll run it again .   
I could go anywhere , any country or city , and enjoy the sights , party , be waited on hand and foot .
”
“ And your victims ?   
You pretended to set up a hero team and baited young heroes and heroines in , only to kill them .
”
“ They are n’t truly dead if they live on in our hearts , or in my heart .   
Have n’t you been listening ?
”
Ashley was silent for a long time .
“ I see .
”
“ I like you , Ashley the second .
”
“
Swansong , if you must distinguish .
”
“
Ah , I have a fondness of using ‘ the second’ , ‘ the third’ , ‘ the fourth’ .   
I was the fourth Unicorn .   
There was a boy who applied to join my team .   
My second Paul .   
It ’s like a way of keeping count as everything marches on .
”
The view bobbed as Ashley nodded .
“
As I said , I like you .   
It ’s my habit to jab and cut when I like something , that ’s all .   
Your friend ?   
She ’s not in any danger from me .
”
“
You ’re a known liar , Monokeros .   
A deceiver .   
You were a spider drawing others into your web .
”
“
I was a unicorn , that every young child wants a few fleeting moments with .   
Wonder , awe , and the fantastical .   
And when they tell those stories in the children ’s books , that ’s so often where the story ends .   
Sometimes a quest , sometimes a moralizing about beauty or the nature of innocence , but most often it ’s an end to that section and set of descriptions .   
Nobody writes an epic about the life lived after the unicorn is befriended .   
It ’s the moment that matters .
”
Ashley was silent .
“
I do n’t want your friend because she is n’t beautiful .   
I ’m sorry , but she ’s scuffed , and it ’s on the face .   
I saw it when I got a glimpse of her .   
I can accept other scars , but I draw the line at the face .
”
“ The lines are showing in your own face , Monokeros , ” Ashley said .
“ Unkind , ” Monokeros said , but there was a note of emotion in it .
“ I might deal with that pod maker before he can fix those lines around the eyes .   
Maybe that would be fitting punishment for using your power on my friend .
”
“
There ’s no need to make something so monumental over something so scuffed and small , ” Monokeros said .   
She sounded irritated .   
“
I ’m saying I do n’t want her .   
Ask any parent if they ’d adopt her or the girl without the blemish .   
Ask any boy if he ’d date a girl with a scar or one without .   
A toy unboxed and scratched is worth a tiny fraction of what it would be if left intact .   
Worth is objective .   
This is not complicated .
”
“ You have no eye for true beauty and worth , Monokeros , ” Ashley said .   
“
I can tell you that .   
I ’d have her as a subordinate , teammate , or friend before I had anyone else .   
You ’re blind .
”
“
Such cutting insults .   
I ’d say it ’s been a pleasure to chat , but I ’d be lying .   
This whole conversation has been so tiresome , ” Monokeros said .   
She retreated inside .   
Her voice was faint .   
“
My kingdom , my kingdom , my kingdom , for a decent housemate .
”
“ You ’ll have no kingdom if I can help it , ” Ashley said , but she said it to herself .   
She turned away , and the view went dark as she reached up for the eye camera with clumsy hands .
Tristan hit the spacebar .   
The video froze .
“
That ’s a pretty good indicator of what we ’re up against , then , ” he said .
I nodded .
“ There were hints , ” Ashley said .   
In the background , Kenzie was with Natalie , drawing something on the whiteboard .   
Ashley ’s projection had come our way .   
“
Monokeros’ attitude , she seemed cavalier , she does n’t keep secrets , she likes to tease , hint , bait .   
It led me to think she had an escape route .
”
“ Goddess , ” I said .
“
Yes , ” Ashley said .   
There was a pause .   
“ Kenzie .
”
I turned to look .   
Sveta and Capricorn did too .
I saw Kenzie smiling .
“
She listened-
I did n’t realize until it was too late .   
My view is n’t as good as real eyes , like this .
” I winced .
“ I do n’t get it , ” Tristan said .
I made eye contact with Ashley- or with her projection .
“ Watch her , ” Ashley said to us , to me in particular .   
“
My gut feeling is it would n’t take much .
” I nodded .








Our group was splitting up , each person assigned a task .   
Sveta attended to the outcast - types , and Kenzie was even communicating with a group online , while Chris looked over her shoulder .   
Rain or Ashley would sign off on the messages before they were sent , just to head off the worst issues .
I found myself wincing a bit at the possibilities-
each of those four had their issues .   
Tristan had seemed confident that they ’d balance each other out .   
I was n’t so confident , but I ’d held my tongue .   
It was one group they were communicating with , and it was better to know sooner than later if there was a communication issue with those four members of Breakthrough .
My destination was a tent city .  
Most in the tent cities had already departed for more secure accommodations , but new people were coming in regularly , and there was a stubborn holdout .   
As I flew over , I could see the efforts that were being made to patch the problem .   
Rigid black sheets of insulation were being laid against the sides of tents with yellow fabric , tents were being moved together and connected , and equipment was being brought in- truckloads of what might have been heaters or furnaces .
It was like a game of musical chairs , but the winners moved on to the next room , new people filed in from outside , and the end of the game loomed closer with every passing day .   
Whoever was in these particular seats come winter was going to have a rough time of it .   
Tents were n’t houses and this area was going to be as bleak as fuck when the snow and food shortages came full swing .
Overhead , the sky was overcast with heavy black clouds , sunlight cracking through .   
The movement of air through portals was generating the flow to keep the clouds rolling , the cracks appearing and disappearing , casting down slices of light before they closed up again .
The landmark I was looking for was a building that looked like a cube .   
Trucks were parked around it , getting their fuel from large drums .   
Rather than construction uniforms , the workers were wearing civilian gear , with only vests to mark them as anything different .
I dropped out of the sky , landing on the ‘ road’ , where the passage of trucks and feet had worn away the grass .   
A gap in the clouds overhead provided a gap for the light to shine through , sweeping over the area .   
Had I seen that light in a movie , I might have imagined it was an alien spacecraft or a rapturing sweeping up people .   
This , though , it was aimless .   
The people were n’t carried up and away , here .
I spotted the teen Major Malfunctions before they spotted me .   
I took a second to take stock .   
Two girls and a boy , ranging from sixteen to eighteen years of age .
The oldest or tallest member of the group was a girl with a dress - like costume that hugged her body , extending all the way to the ground .   
I ’d come across some of the individual pieces of clothing she ’d used to put her costume together in my browsing of stores and
magazines-
and they were n’t clothes
I would ’ve looked at and thought ‘ costume’ .   
A dress in charcoal gray that hugged the body and legs down to a taper at the ankles , exploding into a poof of rolling yellow fabric around the feet .   
She might have bought two of the dresses , because the same ruffles had been borrowed from elsewhere to form the voluminous sleeves with their own yellow explosions of fabric .   
Her hands poked through those explosions , clad in black gloves .
The dress was worn over a turtleneck , which went with a ski mask that covered eye sockets , nose , ears , and chin .   
In effect , fabric covered her from just below her eye level to the ground .   
Yellow - orange eye makeup , bold slashes of black for the eyebrows and nicely done black hair completed the look .
The guy was the tinker of the group , it looked like-
and it was good
they had one , given the ‘ malfunction’ part of the group ’s name .   
He would have been between the two girls in height , except for his suit .   
I hesitated to call it power armor , exactly .   
Power armor implied armor that was heavy enough that it needed machine power to move- remove that power and the tinker was stuck .   
The stuck part probably held true , but this guy had no armor .
No , if I had to come up with a term for this guy , I would have called it an agility frame .   
It did n’t thicken his body , but stretched it out , with an mechanical extension adding two feet to his legs , long mechanical gloves that started at his wrists extending the arms much the same way , and a lightweight set of bars and discs providing the bare minimum of strength to hoist what looked like a syringe filled with maybe ten gallons of pink fluid .   
The syringe ’s needle was n’t the only mount at the front of the fluid ’s case , and various other tools or attachments surrounded the front end of the cylinder , all in metal of varying shades , glosses , and textures .
The frame was made on a budget , given how the spray paint had settled on different pieces in different ways , and it was almost buckling between the guy ’s lean weight and the weight of the cylinder , to the point that the line of mechanical foot to calf to thigh formed a curve , not a straight line .   
His mask was a simple one , a circular plate of metal with eyeholes cut out , worn over a hood of something rubbery that clung to his head .   
The eyes glowed pink .
The girl with the dress so narrow
it seemed to bind her ankles together and the frame that threatened to snap explosively under its own weight made me anxious .   
The third member of the group , at least , seemed a little bit more sane .   
She wore a flat - top cap with a brim that overshadowed a simple domino mask , her auburn hair was wild , and her costume was a cute variation on a military outfit , all in glittery baby blue and a fabric with some stretch .   
I suspected it was something like a dance uniform for a particular number or event that had then been claimed from thrift .   
A stylized music note sat on her breast and the front of her cap where badges or medals might otherwise be .
Which was n’t to say it was n’t cute or cohesive .   
These guys had apparently spent years without much luck on the villain hunting front , but they ’d at least spent the time to find costumes that were pretty darn good for the slapdash sort .   
That her costume was simple and effective was a point for her , in particular .
She was laughing a lot as she talked to the others – and there was something about the timbre of her laugh that made me wonder .   
A very kid laugh .
People had noticed my arrival , and as caught up as the three were in their own discussion , they caught on that others were looking at me .
The youngest one jogged over .   
The oldest moved by sliding herself along the ground- like a chess piece might move , or flight that could n’t lift her off the ground .
And the frame- it was last to start moving my way , but first to arrive , by only a second or two .   
It lurched , lunging a few steps , putting one leg out forward , letting the leg telescope somewhat with springs clearly at work as suspension absorbed the frame ’s full weight , wobbling like it might give way .   
The entire body swayed and shifted to compensate as pink liquid sloshed in the oversized syringe while it proceeded to lurch into motion again .
It made me nervous , on a few fronts , because I could n’t shake the impression that one of those feet would bend too far , snap , and all of the tense springs within would shotgun out to impale bystanders .   
Because he moved like he was in attack mode , and I was the one intruding on their turf .
“
Hi !
” the sixteen - ish year old girl with the cap said .   
“
I ’m
Finale .
”
“
Hi Finale , ” I said , “ I ’m Victoria , or you can call me Antares .   
Either way is fine .
”
“
That ’s Withdrawal , ” she said , indicating the guy .   
“
And that ’s Caryatid .   
We ’re the Major Malfunctions .
”
“ Nice to meet you , ” I said .   
I extended a hand for her to shake , and she clasped it in two of her own , giving it a firm shake .
Withdrawal had to shuffle the syringe over to one shoulder , balancing it precariously there while he extended a mechanical hand across the four foot gap between him and my hand .   
Caryatid was more formal , less unusual , giving me a firm shake .
“
Thank you for coming this far out , ” Caryatid said , sounding very normal for how rigid and aristocratic her outfit was .
“
It ’s not an issue , ” I said .   
“ I can fly , so getting here is pretty painless .
”
“
I ’m jealous ,
” Finale said .   
“ Flying .
”
There was something so guileless about the statement that I was left short on responses .   
I smiled at her and was about to respond when Withdrawal beat me to it .
“
Do you remember what we talked about , when it comes to powers and where they come from ?
” he asked .
“
Yes , ” Finale said , with more severity than necessary .   
“
They usually come from bad days , and sometimes other people ’s powers are n’t as good as they seem from …
”
“ From a distance , ” he finished .
“
Yes .
”
“
That ’s a good thing to keep in mind , ”
I said , smiling .   
“
In my case , though , it ’s not a problem .   
I like flying .
”
She smiled and gave me a thumbs up .
“
How is the team network coming along ?
”
Withdrawal asked .   
He swung the syringe - cylinder around , resting it on one shoulder , before setting his free hand on Finale ’s shoulder .
“ People are reporting their movements .   
Already had a couple of people ask where others were patrolling and adjust their routes .   
Someone called in to ask if we knew anything about a certain villain .   
I knew off the top of my head .
”
“ A bit of a band - aid , to make up for the Wardens being gone ?
” Caryatid asked .
“
Maybe .   
That ’s not the end goal , though , ” I said .   
“
The Wardens and Protectorate were sponges , trying to soak up everything they could .   
We want to empower .
”
“
A lot of people are feeling powerless right now , ” Caryatid said , looking out in the direction of the nearest hole in reality .
“
Can we help ?
” Withdrawal asked .
“
How are you guys with stakeouts ?
”
“
Never done one , ” Withdrawal said ,
“ But we have n’t done a lot that ’s practical .   
Caryatid should be pretty good with that , though .
”
“
How so ?
” I asked .
“ I switch modes , ” Caryatid said .   
“
My other form can only move with my power , and is indestructible with enhanced awareness while still .
”
“ A breaker form ?
” I asked .
“ I do n’t really keep track of the terms , ” she said .   
“
I looked online once
and it seemed like everyone was a breaker .
”
“ Almost everyone is , if you want to be super technical , ” I said .   
“
But that ’s power geek talk .   
If I ’m thinking of the same sites you are , it ’s because the template that was copied for individual cape bios had ‘ breaker’ included in it by accident .
” Finale turned around , looking up at Withdrawal .   
He leaned down , murmuring , “ I ’ll explain after .
”
“
Can you show me ?
”
I asked Caryatid .
She slid a couple of feet to one side , looked around to make sure the coast was clear , and then swept one arm in front of her , bowing slightly .   
The change was subtle- the lines of her dress became a flow , the parts that clung to her rotated , and the rolls of yellow fabric at the sleeve and around the feet began rising and falling , crashing out around her like waves .   
Her hair did much the same , rolling , flowing , taking on motion .
Her face was the biggest change- it looked like butterfly wings , endlessly unfolding , like a multifacted book with pages constantly turning , merging into hairline and the flow of rolls , locks , and loops of hair .
The movement that defined every inch of her slowed , then creaked to a halt .   
Waves and loops became hard crags , with faint sounds like stones scraping against one another .   
Instead of the pages or wings of her face unfolding , they began folding like origami or a glacier , a construction forming around her head , first around the eyes , telescoping , then moving away from the eyes to the ears , with a kind of conscious focus .
“
Yeah , that ’s Breaker ”
I said .   
To Finale , I said , “ Breakers are one of the labels we use for people with powers .   
She changes to this special mode this to use her powers , or to use them at their best .   
Breakers will often want to be careful what costumes they pick , because it becomes a part of the form they take .   
It looks like Caryatid realized that .
” Finale nodded .
“ Breakers are complicated , so a lot of people got confused online .   
That ’s what I was talking about earlier , ” I said .   
“
Even the people who came up with the system got a bit confused at first .   
The important thing is that Caryatid seems to have figured it out .
”
“
Cary ’s smart like that , ” Finale said .   
She walked over to Caryatid , stepping on a rigid crag of dress hem to get close enough to give her teammate a one - armed hug .
Caryatid ’s arm moved very slowly , deliberately , with a break in the rigidity and a resumption of motion that rippled out to the rest of her , based on how much she moved her arm .
“ If you ’re confused about any of it , I ’ll explain after , ” Withdrawal said , again , his voice muffled slightly by his mask .
“
I think I got it , ” Finale said , with a smile .   
She gave Caryatid another hug before hopping down .   
Behind her , her teammate resumed a more mortal form , everything about her relaxing and transitioning to its regular variant .
I was secretly glad that my lesson had gotten across
okay .
I would ’ve felt a bit put out as a power geek if my best attempt at a simple , clear explanation had fallen flat .
I thought for a second , then said , “ One person doing surveillance might be tough .   
Do you need to sleep or eat while in that state ?   
Any long - term consequences ?
”
“ I do n’t need to eat like that .   
I ’ve never tried to stay up all night , ” Caryatid ’s voice had a note of surprise and idle interest , like it had never occurred to her .
I was n’t sure how it had never occurred to her in six years , but this team seemed to have its own wavelength .   
That was fine-
we ’d have to adapt to wavelengths .
“ If you do , be careful , ” I said .   
“ Go easy on yourself , test the waters carefully .   
Sleep is important , and replacing your sleep with your power could leave you feeling mentally off .
”
“ I will , ” she replied , “ Thank you for the warning .
”
“ It might be best to switch off with your team if you do any long stints .
”
“ I ’ll switch off with Withdrawal , ” she said .   
“
If there ’s trouble , Finale has our backs .
”
“
One hundred percent , ” Finale said .
I pulled out my phone and scrolled .   
I found the ‘ mugshot’ , for lack of a better word .   
A grim looking man with his forehead very clearly divided where the front of it transitioned to the sides of his head .   
He might have looked like some renditions of Frankenstein ’s monster , but he had a mustache with zero whimsy to it , just a brush on the upper lip .
“
This is the person you ’ll be keeping an eye on .   
The people who attacked the stations might be working with him , or they might be looking to force him to do what they want .   
I ’ll send you the details , along with his schedule .   
Keep an eye out , discreetly if possible .   
If there ’s weird activity around him , pay attention to that .   
Maybe he ’s already being watched by someone else .   
If he sneaks out at night or goes to meet people , we want to know who .   
Get all the information you can .   
Pictures , license plates , addresses .
”
“
Bit of a problem , ” Caryatid said .   
“
I ca n’t hold bring phones or cameras with me .   
They get chewed up by my form .
”
“
We ’ll figure it out , ”
Withdrawal told her .   
To me , he said , “ We ’ll do it .   
You can count on us .
”
The conviction and determination caught me off guard .   
“
This is n’t paid work , I want to make sure you know .
”
“ I know , ” he said .   
“ We know .   
We want to help .
”
“ If this works out , then we ’ll owe you a favor , ” I said .
“ I do n’t even know what we ’d do with a favor , ” he said .   
“ Just give us a chance to get put on the map .   
We ’ll show the world how awesome Finale is .
”
“
No , do n’t .
”
Finale was suddenly self conscious .   
“
I ’m lame and stupid .
”
“
No , ” Caryatid said .   
“
No , Finale .
”
“
But I am .
”
“
We ’ll talk it out , ” Caryatid said , gentle and firm .   
“
But we ’ll do it away from company .   
If you ’ll excuse us ?
”
“
Of course , ” I said .
They walked away , talking .   
I waited , my hands clasped behind my back .   
When Finale gave me a look over one shoulder , I smiled .   
It got me a smile back .
“ We got in touch online .   
All of us got our powers young-
it was Caryatid and me at first .   
Finale a year later .   
We had different names then , obviously , ” Withdrawal said .
“
Yeah .
”
“ We were fine , got along great , she was a bit immature when we were ten , eleven , twelve , but we grew up and she … did n’t .   
Not mentally .
”
“
Because of her power ?
”
He was startled by that , and the sudden shift in position forced one of his legs to take on additional strain .   
It wobbled precariously , metal straining on each flex to the extent that I could hear it creak and pop .
“
That ’s a thing ?
”
he asked , once he ’d found his stability .
Geez .   
These guys needed to take a powers 101 class .
“ Could be , ” I said .   
“
I guess it does n’t make sense as a thing powers would do .   
Powers tend to steer clear of the suicidal , the helpless , the invalid , or people who are limited .   
I would n’t rule it out one hundred percent , but I would n’t blame the power either .
”
He nodded .   
There was a pause , and then he collapsed into a sitting position , the glass cylinder with its fluid resting on the ground , the syringe point stabbing skyward .   
“
Do n’t scare me like that .
”
“ Sorry .
”
“ Just a bad roll of the dice , ” he said , quiet .   
“
I ’d take a bullet for either of them .   
They deserve better than this , but we spent so long doing nothing at all that getting started became more and more … huge .   
We got here and we ended up in the tents , and it let us dip our toes in the water .
”
“
Did your powers or side effects act up when you were idle ?
” I asked .
“
That ’s a thing ?
”
“ Can be .   
Not all the time , not even most of the time , despite conventional wisdom .   
But it comes up .
”
“
That explains shit , ” he said .   
“
Oh god .   
Why is n’t there a manual or website that walks us through all of this ?
”
“
There was .   
It was called the PRT .
”
“ Could n’t go to them .   
Cary lost her brother when she was young .   
Her family got split up .   
We were like siblings , us three , we only had each other , really .   
We ’d go from one of our towns to the other , to check on family and friends , but we were the only ones who always had each other ’s backs .   
We were worried we ’d get taken away from home or broken up , like how her family got broken up .   
They reached out a few times , but- ”
He stopped there .   
He shook his head .
“
I ’m
sorry
it was such a hard road .
”
“
The answers mean a lot , ” he said .   
“
That favor
I was supposed to ask of you
, I think you did it .   
Or- almost .   
I have more questions .   
After we help , maybe you can give us some answers , as the favor ?
”
“ I can give you some without it being a big favor , ” I said .   
“ I like talking about powers and figuring this stuff out .   
But for today , I think , there are things to get squared away .   
I have other people to talk to like your group .
”
“ Why face to face ?
”
“
Because there are some things that you can only see face to face , like how genuine someone is or if they ’re interested in the mission .
”
“
We ’re interested , ” he said , with barely a breath ’s span between my statement ending and his starting .
“ I know .   
Yes .   
And besides that , there ’s a need to establish a connection .   
A website that you visit a few times a day to log your activities , an email exchange , they ’re things that are hard to keep up with after the novelty wears off .   
Someone who you see face to face ?   
It ’s harder to ignore them .
”
“ Establishing trust , ” he said .
⊙ I landed with more force than was necessary as I returned to the headquarters .   
My feet rang on the metal slats of the fire escape , announcing my arrival .
“
Where are we ?
”
I asked , as I let myself in .
“ Auzure is in .   
They ’ll send people whenever they are n’t actively doing a job , ” Tristan said .   
“
Money takes priority , Lark says , because he thinks that if he ca n’t get money , he ca n’t keep his team running , and it ’s a long - term loss .   
If we start paying him then he ’ll give us priority , even if others are offering a bit more .   
I think the numbers he gave were two hundred dollars a day from us , three hundred from the next guy , he ’ll help us out .
”
“
Can we pay him in New Dollars ?
” I asked .
“ Trading dollars .
” I scowled .   
Then I blinked , looking at Tristan .   
“
I thought it was Byron ’s turn .
”
“ I was antsy , I begged .   
I owe him time later , now .   
He thinks this is important .   
We were talking about money , Sveta talked to Weld and Weld talked to his bosses .   
They ’re going to see what they can funnel our way .   
It wo n’t be a ton , but it ’s going to cover rent .
”
I looked around the room .   
The two members of our group who were in jail were present , as were Tristan , obviously , and Kenzie .
“
No Chris ?
”
“ Out .   
We messaged him to come back .
”
“ And Sveta ?
”
“
Stuck around with the people she was talking to .   
Ratcatcher and others Ratcatcher has talked to .   
They got to talking
and she wanted to keep chatting .   
She ’s on her way back , but she was a good ways away .
”
“
That ’s good .   
Rapport , ” I said .
“
It is .   
Except , ” Tristan said .   
He made except its own statement , with emphasis , glancing at Rain .
“
Except I caught Crystalclear during morning yard , ” Rain said .   
“
We got caught up .   
Everything was foggy before , and we ’re getting a clearer view now .   
We found Goddess .
”
“
Found ?
”
I asked , my interest piqued .
Kenzie opened up a screen , projecting it onto the one wall .   
It was her overhead camera , in an area where the sky was much darker , the light that peeked through much briefer .   
The wind blew at people ’s jackets and hair , whipping it .
“
It ’s a replay , ” Kenzie said .
The camera fixed on one individual .   
A woman , blonde , wearing a light blue jacket with a white fur ruff collar .   
She walked with her hands in her pockets , head down .
As the replay continued , a few droplets of moisture collected on the lens of the camera .   
It blinked them away .   
Each time she raised her head or the wind blew her hair out of her face , the camera took snapshots .   
The various shots of the woman
’s face appeared off to the side , organized into rows and columns by some system I did n’t recognize .
“ Crystalclear is in the prison undercover , ” Rain said .   
“
Once I confirmed I knew you , he talked to his superiors , and they reached out to us .   
One subset of the Wardens .
”
“ They ’re letting us know , but we ’re not supposed to tell the other teams we ’re working with , ” Tristan said .
The scene continued , the woman entering a store .    
The scene skipped ahead to when she was making her exit , now with a bag in hand .
“
Why lead a mundane life when you ’re that powerful ?
” Tristan asked .
The camera zoomed in on the bag , shifting through vision modes , each shift suggesting something about the outlines of what was in the bag .   
Food , it looked like .   
Regular Earth - Gimel groceries .
When the camera pulled back to get a better view of her , she was staring up at it .
“
Good bye , ” Kenzie said .
The hand that was holding the groceries twitched , fingers going from a curled position to straight - out .   
The image shattered- all glitches , artifacts , violent flickering , and the brief audio of a clatter .
“ Broken into a million and a half pieces , ” Kenzie said .   
“
It hurts to lose it .
”
“
She knows we ’re looking at her ?
” I asked .
“
She does n’t care , ” Ashley said .
“ She does n’t , ” Rain said .   
“ Foresight and the Wardens have been keeping tabs on major players .   
They knew she was interested in the prison-
she did n’t make any secrets about it .   
Her underlings have been ringing in regularly .   
That interest of hers was reason enough to watch her .   
She sees them watching and scares them off , just like she disintegrated the camera .   
She does n’t change her routine outside of that .   
She does n’t use powers , they do n’t think , unless it ’s in situations like that just now , and at one point she went for a swim .
”
“ Why is the swim noteworthy ?
”
“
Because she swam three hundred and sixty miles without coming up for air , ” Rain said .
“ She flew underwater , ” Ashley said .   
“
It ’s evasive action , ducking out of sight , going where a lot of cameras and some thinker powers ca n’t .
”
The still images gathered together , then the individual variances served to help it form a three - dimensional map .   
The representation of the head faced the camera , and then began rotating slowly .
Tristan spoke , “ We ’ve got people keeping an eye out for the zealots that are operating around the prison
, Auzure is keeping an eye on the prison medical , Sveta ’s guys will track some key guards , now the Major Malfunctions- who did we give them ?
”
“ I gave them the response team leader , ” I said .   
“
If things get bad and the anklets do n’t work , his people are the ones who suit up and go in .   
If the anklets do work , he ’s one of two people who sign off on pulling the trigger .
”
“
Good to have eyes on him , then .   
We ’ll get more teams in on this later this afternoon .
”
“
She ’s weaponizing the second chance , ” Ashley said .
“
Weaponizing ?
”
Rain asked .
“ Walking among us .   
Disappearing into the crowd .   
She ’s gathering people , and she ’s being subtle about it .   
She ’s too important to go completely unnoticed , but she ’s doing something here .   
She does have minions , she ’s just telling them to stay away .
”
“
Because keeping her allies close would draw too much attention .   
This way , it ’s ambiguous .   
It ’s really hard to take issue with someone who ’s living in an apartment and buying groceries ,
” I voiced my thoughts aloud .
“ We ’re just glossing over the fact she took over a planet , ” Tristan said .
Images popped up .   
They were odd angles , some forced .   
Surveillance camera footage of the street .   
Someone ’s photograph that they had put online , which had her in the background .
“
This is all
I ’m able to find right now , ” Kenzie said .
“
We have thinkers we can turn to the task , ” Tristan said .   
“ Contacts .   
Foresight is offering to help .
”
The screen was practically on fire with the lines that showed connections , ten or more flickering through every second , brute - forcing their way through possible renditions .
More images popped up .   
Someone ’s dash - mounted camera caught her on the street .
“
Let ’s make sure we have some resources , ” I said .   
“
We have the greenlist .   
It might be worth seeing if anyone could help us if she goes rogue or if she tries to collect people by force .
”
“ Power nullifiers ?
” Tristan asked .   
“ Thinkers ?   
Masters ?
”
“
Yeah .
”
“
Let me do that , then .
”
Chris let himself in .   
His eyes immediately went to the wall .
“ Kenzie , ” Ashley said .   
“
Can you do me a favor ?
”
“
Yup .
”
“
The moment she destroyed the camera .   
Can you go back to that ?
”
“ I can go back to that place in things , yeah .
”
The image on the wall shifted .   
Back to the scene where the Lady in Blue had her groceries .
The scene moved around by increments , as the camera hovered , swaying in the wind .
“ There .
”
“ That does n’t do me much good .   
Send it to my laptop ?
”
“
Oh .   
I forgot you were n’t really there .   
Now I miss you .
”
“ I ’m here talking with you .   
It ’s as good as we ’re going to get for now .   
Focus in on the face ?
” Kenzie did , doing the same with the image on the wall for our benefit as well .
Anger , a flash of it , disdainful .
“ Scared , ” Ashley said .   
“ And not of the camera .
”
“ I do n’t see it , ” I said .
“
I can almost see it , ” Chris said .
“
You ’ve seen the footage ?
” I asked .
“
Before you got back .   
I went out to make sure
I ’m free and clear if something happens this afternoon .
”
That soon ?   
We ’re not ready .
There were still people to organize , we needed to find people who might be able to deal with this woman , get them on board , and then coordinate them .   
If none of us could go , then the hit team we recruited would have to .   
Beyond that , what ?   
Civilians ?   
Men and women with guns against an invincible woman who could telekinetically smash a camera from a quarter - mile away ?
All of which ignored the zealots .   
They were n’t invincible , far from it , but they were invisible .
We had no idea of knowing when this could all come to a head .
I heard the squeak of whiteboard marker and I looked .
Tristan was at my board where I ’d listed the ‘ green’ capes and teams .   
The same ones we ’d just recruited .
A black ‘ x’ here .
A black ‘ x’ there .
By my mom and dad , even .   
A black ‘ x’ .
“
Cap-
” I started .   
But he was talking to the phone that was pressed to one ear .
I waited .
He finished .   
Everyone was watching him as he put the phone down .   
When he slashed out the black ‘ x’ by the Kings of the Hill , it was more dramatic , messier , angrier .
“
What happened ?
” I asked .
“
We ’re being undercut , ” Tristan answered .   
“
It ’s going to be a thing tonight , but these teams and people- ”
He stabbed the board .








I hurried over to my computer .   
The setup I ’d put together was n’t really set up for a PR crisis , especially one revolving around us .   
Some people had put in requests for info , with stuff wedged into the wrong fields .   
Others had emailed us directly .
I shut my laptop .   
That particular mutant could be tackled later .
“
Kenzie-
” I said .
“ I did n’t do it , ” Kenzie said , her eyes wide .   
“
I ’ve been good .
”
“ I can count ten things you did that are n’t ‘ good’ in the last week , and that ’s without trying , ” Chris said .
“ I did ?
”
“
Breaking into secured systems , watching people , tapping into phone lines …
” I glanced at Natalie .
“
Oh .   
That .   
I was thinking more about the personal , relationship stuff , ” Kenzie said .
“
I ’d be much more concerned with breaking the law , ” Natalie said .   
“
I need to get caught up , apparently .   
How much of this did you get permission for ?   
What secured systems ?
”
“ I might be a little too frazzled to remember all of them , ” Kenzie said .
“
No documentation ?
” Chris asked .   
“
On top of having no timestamps ?
”
“ Ease up , ” Ashley told him , stern .
“ Not
the time .
”
“
Sure .
”
“ Nobody ’s given me a number , or even a ballpark estimate , for these breaches , ” Natalie said , with a bit more incredulity in her voice .   
“ Someone explain .   
Please .
”
“
It was in the interest of tracking the Cheit attackers and maintaining lines of communication with Ashley and Rain , ” I said .   
“
We talked about some of this .
”
“
Some was pretty concerning .   
I was on the fence about that some , ” Natalie said .   
“ If there was more than some , I ’d have put my foot down .
”
“
Come , use my laptop , ” I said .   
“ Look at my notes .
” I had to pause to open my laptop , a little annoyed that Natalie was making this a point now .   
Too much to juggle , to then have her demanding attention and focus .
I appreciated it on a level , but still .
I lowered my voice , aware I was missing conversation between Kenzie and Ashley in the background as Natalie and I leaned over my computer .   
I kept my voice quieter , “ I detailed it as best
I could here .   
This is where we ’re at , these are the justifications and issues .   
Open - bracket - N - closed - bracket for Natalie , where we consulted .   
Our peek into the prison ’s inner workings is the worst breach , it caught us by surprise , but we consulted you after , we ’re punishing her by restricting visits , and the Wardens and the Guild have signed off on the general thrust of this .
”
“ I ’ll read , ” Natalie said , terse .
I nodded , standing straight and looking back at the group , my computer and Natalie behind me .
“
How does this affect us , if it ’s the breaches , monitoring , and whatever ?
” Tristan asked .
“
We can deal with it , ” I said .   
“
We got ahead of the portal thing-
we did n’t stop it entirely , but we kept it from being worse .   
A lot of people were hooked into that .   
The public would forgive the approach if we could prove results , I think , especially given Kenzie ’s age and the bigger situation .
”
“ That ’s optimistic , ” Rain said .
“
The number one priority- ” I started .
“
Is Kenzie , ” Ashley cut in .
“
Is-
Yes , ” I finished .   
“
Laws are vague , we ’re helping .   
They ’re not going to burn her at the stake .   
At worst , it ’s a headache .
”
“ I ’ll grudgingly agree with that , ” Tristan said .   
“ Total agreement on the headache part .
”
“
We ’ll help you , Kenzie , ” I said .   
“
And I think if it ’s that , we can deal .   
If we get ahead of it and show we can do basic PR and that it wo n’t bounce back on anyone who interacts with us , the others will relax .
She smiled and nodded .
“
Because it needs to be said , there are second , third priorities .   
This situation with Goddess is explosive and dangerous .   
Cheit is dangerous .   
We absolutely can not afford for this to tie our hands or we end up with an international incident , a prison break , or a potential enemy of Gimel recruiting a mess of our most dangerous and depraved parahumans to use against us .
”
“ Or all of the above , ” Rain said .
“
Yes , ” I said .
“
I ’m sorry ,
” Kenzie said .
“ You do n’t even know what crime or incident you ’re apologizing for , ” Chris said .   
“
Do we know what it is ?
”
“
Yeah .   
I ’m sorry .   
What am I sorry for ?
”
Kenzie asked .
“
I ’m still figuring that out , ” Tristan said .   
He ’d just dialed a number on his phone and was holding it to his ear .   
“
But your parents are in on it .
”
“
Oh , ” she said .   
She looked at me .
“
How many things does that narrow it down to ?
” Chris asked .
“
A few , ” Kenzie answered , before giving a short laugh and smiling .
“
I ’m
kind of caught off guard .   
Um .   
The most obvious one is the … parental blackmail ?   
Is that the right word ?
”
“ Extortion , ” I said .
“
Oh , a crime they might go after you for , ” Chris said .
Kenzie looked at me .   
“ Is it ?
” I winced .   
“
Harder to dismiss than the breaches , depending .
”
“ I ’ve noticed how Kenzie asks Victoria for input on it being a problem instead of trusting me , ” Chris was quiet .
“
Feeling left out ?
”
Kenzie asked , the smile dropping from her face as she took on a more serious , somber expression .   
“
I trust you , and I ’m touched that you want to help .
”
“ Uh huh .   
Regretting
I said anything now .
”   
Much like how Tristan was on the phone , having retreated to the far corner of the room , blocking out our conversation with one hand on his other ear , Chris was turning to his laptop .
“ I could go to jail , ”
Kenzie said it as if it was just dawning on her .   
She sat back in her chair , the adjustable metal parts shaking audibly with the force of the movement .   
Her eyes widened , and she turned to look at Ashley ’s projection .
“
No , ” Ashley said , pre - emptively . Kenzie ’s eyes widened .   
“
I could go to your jail .
”
“
Oh geez , ” Rain said .
“
No , ” Ashley repeated .   
“
It ’s not worth it .
”
“ Silver linings , though .
”
“ You ’d be put in another area , on another schedule .   
You ’d be close but probably would n’t ever interact .   
And that ’s if they put someone as young as you in that prison , ” I said .   
“
I think they put most minors in the Wardens HQ , like Bonesaw .
”
“ Aww .   
But it ’s not there anymore , so maybe-
”
“
We ’ll do everything we can to keep you out of jail , ” Ashley said .   
To the rest of the group , she said , “ Victoria and I talked about this being something the Martins might do .
”
I shook my head .   
“
It seemed like something that would come up as part of the tribunal .   
It ’s pretty easy to dodge being put away if you can come up with any excuses or reasonable doubt .   
But they went with it .   
When they did n’t , I figured they would n’t .
”
“
Maybe it ’s something else ?
”
Kenzie asked .   
“
I did n’t really talk about what I was doing with them , and they did n’t ask .   
It ’s not like they could go in my room without me knowing and find notes or anything to use against me , either .
”
“
I have no idea , ” I said .   
My eyes roved over the whiteboards .   
“
We ’ll wait for Tristan to finish his call .   
If it does n’t pan out , I ’ll call some people .
”
“
I ’m looking into stuff too , ” Chris said .
Kenzie smiled .   
“
Okay .   
Thanks guys .
” I frowned .   
“
Do you want to step outside ?   
Chat in private ?   
Or ask something ?   
Do you need anything ?
”
“
I ’m good ,
” she said , smiling lightly .   
“
It ’s stupid .
”
“
What ’s stupid ?
” Ashley asked .
“
Like , surprise , parents !   
And I feel exactly like I ’m
eight years old again
and I hear the car door close outside , and … afternoon cartoons are done .   
Cool babysitter goes home .   
I ’d go to my room to do homework and stay out of the way .   
And then , you know- I talked about this in the group , but then I end up either trying to be perfect or I ’m not perfect
and I ’m anxious about it , but it ’s never a good feeling .   
I was n’t perfect here .
”
“ Nope , ” Chris cut in , his focus on his computer .
Kenzie gave him the finger , but he did n’t see .
“
Perfect is a pretty high standard , ” I said .
“
Yeah , ” she answered , nodding .   
“
Normally I ’m
okay ,
and I was okay before when I knew I had a say
and they were scared , but
… ”
She trailed off .
“ Victoria , ” Ashley said , her voice soft .   
“ Make those calls you were talking about .   
Get answers , because it does n’t look like Tristan ’s having any luck .   
I ’ll talk with Kenzie .   
It ’s all
I ’m good for right now .
”
I glanced at Kenzie , and saw her nod .
Okay .
“
We ’ll reach out to everyone we already talked to or were scheduled to talk to , same way we divided it up beforehand , ” I said .   
“ If they ’re out , find out why , get details .   
If they ’re still in , we might need their help .   
Eyes on the scene , looking out for Cheit .
”
“ Makes sense , ” Ashley said .
“
Let Tristan know , let Sveta know in case I do n’t run into her .   
I ’m stepping outside .
”
“
Good luck , ” Rain said .
I stepped out onto the fire escape , letting the door close behind me .
Between Natalie and the other members of the group , it was too much to balance .   
We ’d figure out what was going on
and we ’d tackle it , but a conversation with that many people in it was n’t a good place for me to get my thoughts in order , even when some were quiet .
I could have pulled out my phone and made a call , but I did n’t .   
The sky was dark overhead , the angle of the sun in the late afternoon made it so it did n’t peek through in fleeting slats and beams as it had earlier .   
The wind was only moderate , if insistent , and the city was eerily quiet for the daylight hours .   
If there was construction ongoing , the wind consumed the sound .
How many heroes were out there ?   
How many teams were doing what the Major Malfunctions were doing , settling into a territory where jurisdiction was n’t contested and just subsisting ?   
No interest or willingness to join other teams , no clues about where the villains were , no information with which to equip or empower themselves .
I ’d pushed for this network because it made a fundamental sense to me .   
I knew it was an uphill fight to get it established .   
I knew there were outright nightmares coming , when groups with views and perspectives as opposed as the Shepherds and Advance Guard ended up butting heads .   
I knew that .   
I was wholly aware , both from real life experience and from parahuman studies , that any grouping of capes was going to be a dramafest at best , an implosion most of the time , and an implosion with collateral damage at worst .
But I ’d wanted to try .
Fucking damn it .
Five minutes .   
Five minutes to get my thoughts in order , and center myself .   
I checked my phone for the time , so I could measure out those minutes .
Three missed calls .   
The cell coverage was so spotty my phone could n’t seem to decide if I had a connection to the greater network or not .   
I did n’t check the missed calls , and instead focused on the signal .
Up .   
Away from things , to a point where I could see more of the city .
Not that long ago , I ’d mused on how I needed to stay connected , because flying could mislead .   
This was me seeking out the disconnection .
I let the five minutes pass , and I checked my missed calls .
A press of the button dialed the number and initiated the call .   
I took a minute to fish out the earbud and plug it in .
“ Victoria , ” my mom said .
“
You called ?
”
“ I had a chat with Tristan on the phone .   
I was worried by how I left things , I gave perfunctory answers , because he clearly wanted to move on and call other people to confirm .   
Given how tense things have been between us-
”
She did n’t finish the sentence .   
Was it meant to be a question , without the inflection ?   
Asking if things were tense ?
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“
I hope you know that dad and I saying we do n’t want to cooperate until this is resolved is n’t because of you .
”
“
Do you know what this is ?
”
“ Allegations against your youngest team member .   
They ’re doing a news segment tonight .   
The people involved are buzzing- they were asking some others for input on the legality .   
Protecting identities , not divulging enough that someone could find out her civilian details .   
But they ’re bringing the parents in .   
The news crews took cameras to the holding prison to record footage or testimony .
”
“
You told this to Capricorn ?
” I asked .   
He ’d said something about the segment , and the involvement of the parents .     
Was it from my mom ?
“
Ninety percent of it .   
The rest is inconsequential .   
Can I help ?
”
“ Without putting your own necks on the line , rep - wise ?
” I asked .
“ If you ask me to , I will .   
Your father will .   
But only if you need it .   
Are you upset ?
” I understood the dynamic they labored under-
they were part of a disparate team , but if they crossed the line or went against the vast majority , there was a chance they ’d be kicked out .
And I ’d be asking them to do it for what ?   
A bit of firepower , when we did n’t have an active enemy to aim it at ?
“
No .   
I ’m not upset .   
It makes sense .
”
“
Good .   
I liked Tristan
’s questions and approach .   
He has a good mind for the PR stuff .   
He ’s attractive , stylish , clever about some of these things .   
Keep him close , Victoria .   
He ’s an asset .
”
“
He ’s a friend .   
If that last bit was you trying to subtly maneuver us into dating , think again .   
That ’s not going to happen .
”
“
It was n’t .   
I see merit , there .   
Nothing more , nothing less .
”
I nodded , annoyed and restless .
“ We had a similar experience , back in the beginning .   
A team with all the promise in the world , people were talking about us , the public was supportive , the law , the heroes …
”
“
And then Auntie Jess died .   
Murdered .   
New Wave lost its momentum .
”
“ It lost what it initially had .   
I ’d like to believe that if things had been left alone , if we had n’t had to deal with the horror that came with Leviathan or after , we might have found our way back to prominence .   
All it would take would be the right event , all of us coordinated in how we ’d approached it .   
Ideally , you would have all been over eighteen , and we could have gone all out in the public eye .
”
I was n’t sure how to respond .   
It was n’t that like my mom to be so impractical and out there , talking hypothetical situations .
Had Leviathan been that right event , with all of us not coordinated enough ?   
Too many of us had died .
I suppressed a sigh .   
I wondered how my mother ’s mind worked
and I did n’t want to know , at the same time .
I could barely remember Auntie Jess .   
The memory was occluded by the very clear distinction of a sniveling kid in a courtyard- someone who ’d been looking to earn his stripes as a member of our local racist troupe .   
He ’d cried , begged , and asked for his dad to save him when the pronouncement had come from the court .   
I could remember seeing him and being disgustedly disappointed in him .   
That someone as awesome as my aunt had been killed by someone as far from awesome as him .
No-
no .   
That had n’t been my opinion .   
It had been something my mom had said that had struck so close to home that it felt like my own idea .
My opinion had been a quiet certainty that his craven behavior in court would at least ensure that he did n’t get what he wanted .   
He would n’t get his initiation into the gang if he acted like that .   
And I ’d been wrong .   
He was young , he had n’t been tried as an adult , and he ’d gotten out in short order .   
He ’d gone straight to Empire Eighty - Eight and been welcomed with open arms .
Auntie Jess-
she had n’t been a true aunt- Uncle Mike had n’t gotten around to marrying her .   
She was a pretty , dark - haired woman in the photographs we had too few of – good straight - on images of her face being rare .   
She was foggy memories amid holidays and other focuses .   
I could remember bedtime stories with- with Amy and me on either side of her .   
My most recent memory of her was all of us in the backyard , Eric , Amy
and I trying to do a thing chaining water dart guns together , like Eric had seen in a video .   
He ’d been insistent we ’d make it work , and his dad was to be the victim of the barrage .   
Auntie Jess had saved us by grabbing one of the water dart guns and starting a war .
There ’d been a break in the conversation , but it lingered in a way that made me think my mom was lost in memory too .
I was trying to formulate a response when she spoke up again .   
“
The media hounded us , after Fleur died .   
We had a lot of discussions on how New Wave should handle it .   
We were disheartened , heartbroken , tired .   
We decided to let the news cycle roll over while we mourned .   
It made sense .   
By the books , it was how we were supposed to handle the public relations side of it .   
As a family , we needed to take care of each other .
”
“
Yeah .   
It makes sense .
”
“ All the sense in the world , ” she said , in a different tone .   
Wistful .
I sighed .
“ I heard that , ” she said .
“ Things were coming together .   
I ’m worried about timing .   
It ’s occupying us at a time when we really have bigger things to worry about .
”
“ I remember you mentioning some of those things .   
Is it a distraction ?   
When masterminds are in play , you ca n’t assume it ’s a coincidence .   
If you ’re doing something big and there ’s a wrench in the works …
”
She left the statement at that , open ended , inviting a response .
“
It ’s not out of the question .
”
“
Who do you know that would employ that kind of distraction ?
”
“
Everyone ?   
Any major player ?   
Tattletale ?   
If it ’s a distraction , we could ignore it .   
Let it go , like how you guys ignored the media and focused on mourning .
” I was putting it forward as a hypothetical .   
I did n’t believe it , myself .   
We could n’t ignore it , when it was potentially character assassination of a child .
There was a pause on the phone .
“
Did I lose you ?
” I asked .
“
I ’m wrestling with a thought .   
Do you have others to call ?
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“ You can hang up , and we ’ll update you the moment we have any information that could help , ” my mother said .
“
I ’m curious what that thought of yours was ,
” I said .
“ I do n’t want to butt my head in where it is n’t wanted .   
Unsolicited advice ?
”
I thought about it .
“ I ’ll take whatever advice I can get , ” I said .
Below me , Sveta had arrived .   
I would have waved , but she would n’t have seen me .   
She pulled herself up to the fire escape , metal limbs clanging on metal slats , and then let herself inside .
“
Do n’t make the same mistake we did .   
If you ’re trying to build something , defend the turf it ’s founded on .   
Do n’t let others decide what the narrative is .   
Do n’t fight it-
that ’s the path of cowards and tyrants , and you do n’t want to appear to be either of those things .
”
“
Ignore the rules ?   
Go on the offensive ?
”
“ Do n’t give them ammunition .   
Do show you wo n’t fold .
”
“
It ’s dangerous to do that , given the current climate .
”
I expected argument , retort , elaboration .
“
Yes , ” she said .   
“
It is .
”
Only confirmation .
“
Good luck , ” she said .   
“
We ’re available if you need us .
”
“
Would you be willing to help with something that is n’t in the public eye ?   
No backsplash if this all goes wrong .
”
“
What something ?
”
“ Surveillance , ” I said .   
“
And for the record , it feels really weird to ask for my mom to conduct surveillance .
”
“
It felt weird to tell my fourteen year old daughter to break a man ’s arm , once upon a time , ” she said .   
“ We adapt .   
I ’ll do it , invite your dad , we ’ll swap shifts .
”
“ I ’ll email you the particulars , ” I said .
We left it at that .   
The wind whipped at my hair and hood as I floated in the air .
I called the Paint Fumes team , not that that was their real name , but I had to call them something .   
Tempera was out .   
Fume Hood was in .
The Major Malfunctions were in .   
They had no idea that there was even a welling PR issue , and when I explained it , they seemed to have some difficulty understanding why it would change anything for them .
I was n’t sure if I should send Fume Hood with their group for the extra backup or split things up .   
It was a weird combination to imagine .
I landed on the fire escape , then opened the door .
All conversation stopped .   
In the corner of my vision , Kenzie hit a key , and an image disappeared from the wall .
“
You ’re back , ” Rain said .   
“
That was fast .
”
They ’d thought I was gone ?   
That I ’d flown off to talk to people in person , maybe ?
“ I went up , not away , ” I said .   
I could n’t help but notice the awkwardness in the air , the lingering silence .   
“ Is there a problem ? ”
“
No problem , ” Chris said .
I looked at Sveta .   
She gave me an uneasy smile .
“
You ’re all acting weird .   
Paranoia makes me think it ’s a stranger effect ?
”
“
No , ” Rain said .   
“ If it was , Ashley and I would n’t be affected .
” I nodded .
The cape geek in me wanted to say probably not .   
But there were stranger effects that were able to be passed on with recordings and written words .   
Rare , but they existed .   
Blindside from the community center attack , I was pretty sure , could turn cameras away or black them out .   
There were hypnotic singers who transmitted their effect through digital devices .
People were looking between each other .   
There seemed to be a consensus as just about all eyes turned to Sveta .
Not Natalie ’s , for one thing .   
She looked about as confused as I felt .
But it seemed Sveta had been decided by unspoken agreement to be the one to handle this .
“
It ’s mundane , ” Sveta said .   
“
Kind of .   
Can we change the subject ?
”
“
The sudden change or lack of subject is why I ’m confused , ”
I said , wary .
“ Please ?
” she asked .   
“
Do n’t make a big deal of this ?   
Count it as coming from me , speaking as a friend ?
”
“
Does it tie into Kenzie ’s situation , Cheit , Goddess , or any of the things we ’re trying to juggle here ?
”
“ Not in a way that impacts our mission
, I ’m pretty sure , ” she said .   
She had to look to others for confirmation .
I swallowed hard .
It looked like she genuinely did n’t know what to say or do .
Chris was staring me down , eyebrows furrowed .   
Tristan-
he looked almost casual , thumbs hooked into his pockets , hands flat against the sides of his thighs .   
Kenzie-
hard to read .   
No smiles , at least .   
Rain kept glancing at the blank spot on the wall where the projected screen had been .   
Ashley looked like she was busy thinking .
No , Ashley was impatient .   
it was hard to tell when her body was n’t giving the right body language , just default poses and stances .   
Her face , though .   
Irritated ?   
Agitated ?   
Restless ?
“
Okay , ” I said .
“ Just like that ?
” Chris asked .
“
My parents will handle some surveillance .   
Fume Hood and the Malfunctions will as well , but they ’re novices when it comes to that .
”
“
That ’s reassuring , ” Tristan said .
“
We can get others , ” I said .   
“
Tap the teams , figure out who does n’t care about PR .
”
“
The good ones do , ” Tristan said .   
“
I called , on your suggestion .   
They told me your idea of how we move forward , so I reached out .   
I only got one of my four teams to agree , and they are n’t totally committed .
” I nodded .   
I ’d somehow figured mine would be more loyal – not because I was anything special , but because there was a lot more personal investment in it .   
I outlined the next step in my greater plan , “ We ’ll scratch together something to hold down the fort , and then we handle the current PR crisis .   
Once it ’s handled , those who flew the coop should come back to roost .
”
“ You ’re going to let this go ?
” Chris asked .
“
Hm ?
”
I made a sound .
“
I do n’t think you ’re sincere , saying you ’re going to ignore this whole thing here , just because Sveta asked nicely .
”
“ We have other things to focus on .
”
“ We do , ” Tristan said .   
“
Do n’t cause trouble , Chris .
”
“
I only kinda - sorta agreed to this because I thought she would n’t go for it .
”
Ashley looked away .
I was noting Ashley ’s silence .   
She seemed annoyed .   
Chris …
he was baffled , if I had to put my finger on it , which was a very different thing from Natalie ’s confusion .
Those were the three who looked more bothered by this scene .
“
I trust Sveta , ” I said .   
“
And I trust you guys as a group .   
Whatever the other teams are reporting-
you ’re keeping it from me .   
Okay .   
Because I trust you guys , I ’ll trust you ’re doing it for the right reasons .
”
“
It ’s weird , ” Chris said .
“ Chris , ” Tristan said .
“
It is , but I ’m going to go with it , ”
I told Chris .   
“
Because I trust them .   
There was someone in the past who told me something .   
I ignored them , I gave them a hug .   
Everything fell apart .   
My best friend tells me not to pry ?   
Fine .   
I ’ll listen .
”
“
Best friend .   
That ’s so sweet , ” Kenzie said .
Sveta did n’t look like she was super happy .   
Guilty ?   
Something else ?
I put it out of mind .   
My concern was more in the realm that I really wanted to talk to Sveta about other things , and now it might seem like I was trying to butter her up with gifts or attention .   
It was just so hard to actually sit her down and have a conversation .   
We kept getting interrupted or distracted .
“
First problem is the PR issue , ” Tristan said .   
“
If we ca n’t fix that , it ’s impossible to do anything else .
”
“ We get out ahead of it , ” I said .
“ Solving one quasi - illegal or illegal issue with more extortion , ” Ashley said , her tone dry .   
“ Naturally .
”
“
Nobody said extortion , ” Chris answered .   
“
That ’s really interesting , that you immediately think of that .
”
“
It ’s sarcasm , you oaf .   
Figure out a form that helps you figure it out and spend a month or two in it .   
You have a lot of catching up to do .
”
There was an insult in the first sentence and a harsh phrasing throughout , but Chris did n’t seem to mind .   
He even smiled a little .
“
I have some info , ” Chris said .   
“ I did some searching .
”
“
It ’s really interesting to see
which times get you most into things , ” Rain said .   
“
They tend to be the worst times .
”
“ Intriguing times , ” Chris said .   
“
Which are some of the worst because powers are both intriguing and they ’re fountains of suck .
”
“
What info ?
” I asked .
He looked at his computer .   
“ One of the TV studios owned by a Mr. Buckner is handling this whole thing .   
It ’s going out on the radio first and then depending on whether it ’s a success or not , they ’ll televise a continuation .   
People drive home from work in the late hour , they catch it , they listen , and then they get home and turn on the television .
”
“
How did you get this ?
” I asked .
“ I have like , forty online accounts .   
A lot are connected , but if I ’m careful not to post too often , I can build up a persona and people accept me into their communities .   
I have something like four accounts in four very different sub - communities .
”
“
Because you deceive people about who you are ?
” Sveta asked .
“
Sure , ” Chris said .   
“
It works .   
The television studio had employees doing research on Parahumans Online .   
I ask Lookout
and … she confirmed it .
”
Which was code for ‘ she broke in and stole info’ .
Natalie did n’t seem to have been fooled by it .
“
Why forty accounts ?
” I asked .
“ Fog of war .   
It confuses investigators online , makes my trail harder to follow .   
Algorithms track everything you do , so I break it all up .   
One set of names for one site , another for another site .   
It lets me narrow down what came from who , if I get an email to one account or another .
”
“ Seems unnecessarily complicated , ” Tristan said .
“
Do n’t know what to tell you , ” Chris said .   
“ Except that it worked for us in this instance , so stop getting on my case .
”
“
It ’s good , ” Tristan said .   
“ Question is , what do we do about it ?   
Mug ’em ?   
Tell them to leave it alone ?   
Ignore them ?   
I should stress that if we ’re doing anything in costume , you ’re going to have Byron as a tagalong , not me .
”
“
We should n’t ignore them , ” I said .   
“
If they ’re intending to spread lies- ”
“ They could spread inconvenient truths and it would be bad , ” Ashley said .
“
Urg , ” Kenzie said .
“
All the more reason , ” I said .   
“
When is the show ?
”
“ Three hours , ” Chris said .
“ We could try getting on the show .
”
“ I asked , ” Tristan said .   
“ They do n’t want us .   
That ’s our big issue .   
It ’s a hit piece , probably aimed at Kenzie by her parents , and it ’s going to be organized so they can leverage the fear or whatever that they play up .   
Kenzie ’s parents get to discredit the primary witness against them , and there ’s no competing viewpoint to screw with that or muddy the waters .
”
“ Spooky , ” Kenzie said .
Sveta rubbed Kenzie ’s shoulder with a prosthetic hand .
“ Stupid that preys on fears gets a lot of traction , ” Rain said .   
“ If you want airtime , you need to offer something stupider or more nonthreatening than what they ’ve got in line .
”
“
No , ” I said    “ I refuse to believe that .   
That ’s not what this ecosystem is about .
”
“ Post Gold Morning ?
”
Rain asked .   
“
I might have been interacting with a biased pool of people , but I feel like it weighs pretty heavy on us .   
It breaks people a bit .   
People are so overwhelmed by the end of the world and an entirely new universe that they ca n’t even think straight .   
Someone tells them how to think ?   
They jump on it .
” I frowned .
“ I ’ve seen that fear and anger , ” Sveta said .   
“ Against case fifty - threes .    
By them .
”
Fear and anger .   
I spoke , “ I want to go on the show with our most stylish , best PR people on the team .   
If we offer the right thing , maybe we can swing it … like if we take the next two hours to ask the other teams if it ’s okay , and then we put ourselves forward as the sacrificial goats .
”
“ The goats ?
” Tristan asked .
“
We ca n’t reach everyone , ” Sveta said .
“
No , ” I agreed .   
“
But at this stage , if someone comes to us and they ’re angry about us talking about things they wanted to leave alone … let them be angry .   
If they do n’t matter , we deal .   
If they do matter , we tell them the truth .   
That there ’s too much at stake these days , and they need to step up or get out of the way .   
A small convenience is n’t worth everyone being in the dark .
”
“ You ’re putting out a fire by dropping a bonfire on it , ” Rain said .
I glanced at the blank spot on the wall .
Yeah , I did n’t want to give up .   
I did n’t want this team to be an idea that existed for a fleeting moment , then existed as a haunting echo thereafter .   
Good moments ?   
Sure .   
Some celebrity , some success , money , whatever .   
But the momentum had been lost .
I wanted to keep the momentum .   
There was a need among people , and capes were aching for unity and collaboration .   
They wanted security .   
That could be granted .   
If we were going to go up against giants , we had to swing big and swing high .








Five minutes to fly to Ashley ’s place -now
my apartment- , three or four minutes to get things .   
Six minutes to fly back against the headwind .   
I came back to the headquarters to find everything on fire .
Not literally on fire , but for all intents and purposes , everyone was in motion and being loud except the two people who were n’t really there .   
Costumes , hair , clothes , words .   
In making my proposal , I was throwing us to the wolves .   
I was trusting that we could do okay , come out the other side with the confidence of outside parties .   
The confidence of the city , who would be listening and rewatching things for days to come .
Everyone running around like they were on fire was … entirely fair .   
At least it was n’t a grim silence , this time .
I had to be a pillar .   
I could n’t get swept up in the chaos .   
I put my bag of the stuff I ’d grabbed from Ashley ’s place on a computer chair , and used a push of my foot to send it across the room , to the corner that was mine .   
I walked over , through the metaphorical fires that were igniting and being put out .
Natalie was hanging back , actually fairly near Chris’ usual nook .   
Looking stuff up on her phone , it seemed , or frantically communicating .   
Worry lines creased her forehead .
Ashley was with Chris , the two of them staring at a phone .   
Kenzie was beside them , facing the other direction as she typed away .
“ I want you to wear the armor , ” Tristan said , to nobody in particular , as he walked across the room .
An instant later , with some blurring and glowing eyes , he was Byron .   
“ Your armor .   
I ’m supposed to be you ?
”
Another shift .   
Tristan glanced at me .   
He drew in a breath , eyes unfocusing , one hand gesticulating as he paced toward his station in the headquarters , not even alongside words-
he was n’t speaking yet , but punctuating thoughts before he outlined them .
“
Yeah .   
I can shift down , wearing my stripped - down costume , secondary armor and bodysuit , mask , present better for the cameras , it ’s a bit of an effect , it ’s almost like disarming , and it ’s cool , ” Tristan replied .
“
It would be effective , ” Ashley said .
“ It would be scary people with powers using powers while at a public venue , ” Sveta said .
“
That ’s a good point , ” I said .
“ It ’s not even really using a power , ” Tristan said , dismissive .   
He switched out .
“ Natalie ?
” I asked .
She lifted her head , eyes wide , wider behind her glasses .
“ Give us a civilian perspective ?   
Someone does the transforming thing like Tristan and Byron do , in a tense but civil situation .   
How do you react ?
” They changed and changed back to demonstrate .
“
At a television studio ?   
I would n’t mind , I do n’t think , ” Natalie said .   
“
But I ’m weird .   
There are a ton of things that bother me that other people treat as normal , and a ton of things I would n’t blink at things that annoy or freak out other people .
”
“ I respect that , ” Chris said .   
“
Yes , you have to find that nugget of you and cling to it .   
That stuff that makes you different .
”
“
It ’s not anything fancy , ” Natalie said .   
“
I ’m anxious about the stupidest stuff
and I can get zen with routine work and chores .   
There are maybe three times in my life something horrible happened near me , and I kept my cool while other people were breaking down .   
That ’s basically it .
”
“
Fancy enough , ” Chris said .
“
It ’s really not , ” Natalie replied .
“
Nat , if you have Chris’ respect , take it and run .   
That ’s better than a lot of us get , ” Rain said .
“
That ’s not true , ” Chris said .   
“
I respect you guys , mostly .   
I think you ’re obnoxious and wrong - headed , but you do n’t suck at everything .   
If you did , I would n’t be here .
”
“
Okay .   
Keep swiping , ” Ashley indicated the phone Chris held .
“
I tell people I respect them
and I get told to get back to the grunt work .   
People wonder why I ’m the way I am , ” Chris said .
Natalie frowned a bit at Chris , then seemed to remember something , going by the small look of surprise on her face .   
She snapped her attention to me .
“
Oh , Victoria !   
We got the go - ahead from Ms. Kenzie Martin
’s guardianship to have her on the show .
”
“
Good , ” I said .   
“
If you ’re up for it , Kenzie ?
”
“
Yeah .   
So long as I ’ve got you guys .
”
Tristan had said something .   
He switched .
Byron shook his head .   
“
There three things
here I have issues with .   
Your armor is heavy , and I ’m not that strong .   
Why are you in the spotlight , when I ’m supposed to get the extra hours tonight ?   
And why ?   
Really why is it so important
I wear the armor ?
”
He switched back to Tristan .   
No immediate reply from the bolder brother , but Tristan ’s hand was in motion , like an orchestral conductor with his stick .   
Flick , flick , stop-
he met my eye , and there was a light in his eyes .
He was nervous and he was also wholly in his element , getting ready to face this .
I was going to say something , but I heard the others .   
Chris was being cranky , still on about the swiping .   
Ashley and Kenzie were talking to him .   
That was more of an immediate concern , as much as I worried about Tristan wanting to do this so badly he was willing to bulldoze over Byron .
“
I ’m going to get a repetitive stress injury if you do n’t pick , ” Chris said .   
He had a phone in hand , and he was swiping , swiping , swiping .   
“
Kenzie ’s putting something together to make it easier , so why not just wait two minutes and spare me the pain ?
”
“
You ’re not that weak , ” Ashley said .
“
I ’m literally that weak , ” Chris said .   
“
I ’m prone to just about everything , because of all the tiny flaws in how I ’m put together .
”
“ Keep scrolling , ” Ashley said .
Chris leaned back , his elbow shoving the dinner - plate sized disc that handled Kenzie
’s
lesser projections in the field .   
It moved toward the table ’s edge , the lip of it extending over .   
“ Oops .
”
Kenzie ’s head snapped up .   
Her eyes locked onto the disc .   
“ If you knock that over , I ’m going to hold you down and flash you so many times light comes out your butt .
”
“
Wording .   
Flash gun , ” Chris said .
“
Or I ’ll use the eyehook and get inventive , ” Kenzie said .   
She waved her hand and the eyehook that was draped over the end of her workstation made a limp shuffle forward .   
The combination of the weight of the hook on the end and the new position of the prehensile limb made it slide off the table , collapsing noisily in a heap on the ground .
“
Nice , ” Chris said .
“ That was meant to be way more intimidating , ” Kenzie said .
“
We ’ll work on that , ” Ashley said .
Kenzie nodded , looking at Chris .   
“
Keep scrolling .
”
“ Keep scrolling , ” Ashley repeated .
“ Uuggh .   
Maybe I should just say
I ’m coming , and I need to get ready , just so I do n’t have to keep doing this .
”
“
Yeah , right , ” Rain said .   
“ Mr. Privacy is going to go up and put himself out there in front of millions .
”
“ I could hide my face with the projector .
”
“ You could , except they ’re already taken .   
I ’m using one for me
so I do n’t have to have my helmet on , and I ’m bringing one so we can have Ashley come along .
”
“ You ’re coming ?
”
I asked Ashley .
“ For Kenzie .   
Is it a problem ?
”
There were issues , but …
“
You can tell me , ” she said .   
“ Tristan was against , Kenzie was for .
”
“ If she ’s not going I do n’t want to go , ” Kenzie said .
“
And … ” I looked at Rain and Sveta , who were hanging back .   
“
Where are you guys ?
”
“ I ’m obviously not going .   
I ’m worried that if I comment or touch anything I ’m going to make it worse , ” Rain said .   
“
I do n’t know enough about this stuff .
”
“ I know just enough to say I ’m worried-
” Sveta said .
“
Worried is a good way of putting it , ”
Rain cut in .
“ -And
I feel only dread , ” Sveta finished .   
“ Not about Ashley going .   
All of it .
”
“ We have to do something , ” Kenzie said .
“ I know .   
I even agree with Victoria .   
I trust her .   
I ’m just worried this will be a disaster .
”
“ Agreed , ” Rain said .
“
You two are really on the same page , huh ?
” I asked .   
I unlocked my computer and checked the messages .   
While the page loaded , I began fishing things out of my bag .   
Makeup , a hot roller for my hair , hair stuff , a clothes brush
… “
We ’re the ones on the sideline for this , ” Rain said .   
“
Us two and Chris .
”
“ And Natalie , ” Rain said .
Natalie nodded .   
“
I ’ll be at the studio , so I can monitor Kenzie , but please do n’t put me on stage .
”
“
Absolutely wo n’t , ” I said to her , before looking back to the pair of Rain and Sveta .   
“ Your vote counts .
”
“
This is your thing .   
You and Tristan , you understand … PR , ” Sveta said .   
“
And I do want to learn ,
so I understand it for next time , but I trust your instincts more than I trust mine .   
I know almost nothing .   
You make the tie - breaking call on bringing Ashley .
” I nodded slowly .   
I did n’t want it to be me .   
It put me pretty squarely between multiple members of the group , and the fact that so many people were abstaining made it feel more like feelings would be hurt .
I looked at Ashley , and saw her with her chin held high .   
Kenzie practically bounced as she talked to her .
That was Kenzie ’s happiness .   
In motion , restless and hard to restrain , words falling out of her mouth rapid - fire .
“ Tristan , ” I called out .
Byron switched .   
Tristan walked over to me , then asked , “
What ?
”
“
I ’m thinking we should bring Ashley .
”
“
They ’re going to shit - talk Kenzie , ” Tristan said .   
“
I ’m going to have trouble not punching faces .   
Ashley will have a harder time .
”
“ She ca n’t hit people like this .
”
“
She can say something , though , ” Tristan said .
“
So can we .   
Worst case scenario , we blip her out , explain it away .
” Tristan drew in a breath .
“
If it ’s the two of us alone , it ’s going to feel like we ’re the PR team .   
They go after one of us , or they create an issue , and we ’re done .   
Bring Kenzie in , it feels more personal .   
Bring someone like Ashley in , and I think we ’ll shed the image of being the public relations branch of something bigger , because it ’s easier to have an actual , natural back and forth .
”
“
Ca n’t bring Rain , ” he said .   
“ Not enough projectors , according to Kenz .   
Ca n’t bring Chris , because we want to win this PR battle .   
Sveta ?
”
“
No , ” Sveta said .
“
Then Ashley .   
Fine , makes sense , ” he said .   
He went back to what he was doing with his costume buckles and plates .
Sveta helped me by holding my bag while I fished past stray receipts , some paper , and finally got the last of the individual makeup things out .
“ You do n’t want to come on ?
”
I asked her .
She shook her head .   
“
I ca n’t do- that .   
The makeup , the hair .   
I do n’t have the clothes for it .   
I ’m toxic , too .
”
“
Toxic ?   
No , ” I said .
“
Yes .   
The other Case Fifty - threes hate me .   
Every time I pop up in the news because people know
I ’m
dating Weld , it gets bitter and nasty .   
For now I want to keep my head down .
”
“ We keep trying to talk and getting interrupted or distracted , especially about- ” I stopped , glancing at Rain .
“ I ’ll get out of your hair , ” Rain said .
“
I did n’t mean to scare you off ,
” I said .
“
S’alright .   
I might need to referee for Tristan and Byron .
”
Rain half - walked , half - floated across the room , a camera periodically becoming visible at the edges where his head moved too much .   
Sure enough , Tristan and Byron were arguing .
“
And-
I really do want to spend time with you and cover all the bases , get one hundred percent caught up , and make sure there ’s no stone unturned- of course , no touching any stones you want to leave alone .
”
“ You mentioned shopping once , ” she murmured .
“ I did , ” I said , using my flight to make getting under the table to plug my hot roller into the wall .   
“
I was under the impression you did n’t want to talk about any of that stuff .
”
She leaned closer , nearly losing her grip as she seized a table edge
so she could bend over better .   
“
You ’re an exception .   
You ’re my friend .   
Tristan is pushier .
”
“
Got it , ” I said .   
“
We ’ll do something .   
Get you clothes you like ?
”
She nodded .
“
Something closer to hippie , surfer , bohemian styles ?
”
“ I have no idea what those things are , but yes .   
Soon ?
” she sounded almost eager .
I ’d been neglecting my friend , trying to juggle this everything thing .   
I felt bad .
“
Soon .   
I promise .
”
“
Tell me what you ’re doing , so I can learn some of it ?
”
“
Absolutely , ” I said .   
I saw a message pop up on my screen .
Advance Guard : if u want to bite that bullet for the rest of us , is ur funeral Shortcut
’s response , I was thinking it was Shortcut because I refused to believe it was anyone half - decent , was the latest in a long line of general agreement .
In the background , Tristan was in Rain ’s company .   
Kenzie was switching up her costume colors , and Ashley was-
I had to look twice .   
She and Kenzie had moved the camera away from the projected image of Ashley .   
Now the image was changing clothes and hairstyles .
The thing on the phone – had that been a game ?   
A character customization menu , used to finalize her costume details and look for the projection ?
“
Your hair ?
”
I heard Byron , incredulous .   
“
So the real reason you ’re pushing for me to wear this heavy - ass armor is because you do n’t want helmet hair ?
”
I caught the dubious look I got from Sveta .
“ We ’ll get the wackiness out of the way now , talk strategy in the car .
”
The look did n’t pass .
⊙ ‘ B - TV’ .   
The building loomed above us as we got out of the car .   
It was me , Capricorn , Lookout , and , after a short delay for the camera and projector to boot up , Swansong in a dress that combined black and white .   
The dress had costume lines and straps that crossed over at the collarbone .   
Elegant , but short enough a dress that it could have been indecent .
Natalie climbed out of the car and stood off to the side .   
She pulled off her puffy jacket , throwing it back into the car , before locking it .   
Back to her more professional demeanor .
I ’d read up on Buckner , the person who controlled over half the media we got in the city , and I did n’t get the parahuman vibe from him .   
Back in the day , the racist gang leader had turned out to be a businessman , outed as part of a massive break in the unwritten rules .   
Tattletale , naturally .   
But it had made sense .   
Max Anders had been a name that I ’d been familiar with through my association with Dean , I ’d seen him around three or four times in my visits to high society .   
He ’d given me no overt clues , and yet I ’d been entirely unsurprised .
Doing the cape thing in any meaningful capacity took too much effort .   
Being successful and being a cape ?   
Possible .   
Max Anders , AKA Kaiser , AKA the CEO of Medhall , he ’d done it .   
But there ’d been something missing- I ’d seen it in my mom , as she ’d struck the balance of being a prosecutor and a heroine .   
When you lived two demanding lives then petty things had to be pared away , like levity or idle hobbies .
Buckner was a storm of multimedia , a finger in a hundred pies , and he spent a lot of time trying to promote and investigate side things .   
He went to concerts with new bands playing , sponsoring them , and had photos taken with him and the band on stage at the end of the night .   
Artists , actors , movie ideas …
Too inane to be a cape .
The building was glass panes in a grid of metal bars , tinted windows that caught the glare of the spotlights .   
There ’d been a brief point in time when the city was under construction that the building would have been nice , taller than all of the rest that were going up around here , a visual break from the siding and brick that made up most buildings .
But that moment had been brief .   
Materials had been prepared and arranged in advance , and buildings had gone up fast once we ’d had the labor .
Squat , ugly , nothing distinctive about it , now , except for the illumination and the people who milled around in it , getting their smoke breaks in , one or two with hands tucked into their armpits , until they needed to bring one up to the cigarette .
I was n’t warm either .   
I looked at the others .
“
Let ’s go , ” Capricorn said .
The lobby was brightly lit , organized in a way that would let whole crowds file in and out , or even stand comfortably around for a media or news event .   
The front desk was organized appropriately for that same purpose , set up like an island in the middle of open space , the ring of desk serving to fortify against and divert the ebb and flow of any crowd .   
Employees were dressed in uniforms that , like the very design of the B - TV building , would have looked fantastic in the right moment in time .   
As it was , the cheaper suits with vests beneath looked like the kinds of uniforms a movie theater employee would wear , with a jacket added .
Those were the employees that mobilized to approach us , to manage us .   
We ’d called just before we arrived , and they were ready .
Three people for the five of us , but the security team at the other end of the room moved as we did .
My costume was clean , face made up in a way I normally would n’t bother with if I was going out in costume , my hair dressed up , with no braid , only the loosely spiraling tumble of hair over my shoulders , my hood pulled down over my forehead , the spikes of the hood
’s ornamentation at my brow , working with the metal band that we ’d worked into the white trim to keep the hood in position .
Lookout was in silver and dark gray , with an illuminated green at spots all around her costume , including the lenses of her mask .   
An eye icon was displayed in white against the dark green plate of the circular projector , which was worn on her chest .   
The eye shifted between three different configurations of lines and circles , an endless shuffling .   
Another plate was at her shoulder , smaller than the other , with wires running along her suit to it- power .   
That would be the projector that let us have Swansong with us .
She had her Eyehook , but it was in a discreet mode .   
No gun , no weapon , toolbelt reduced down to the essentials .   
While she walked toward the front of the group , the encasement around one of the buns of her hair opened up .   
The bun , a mechanical pupil surrounded by a green iris , started staring at me .   
She turned her head , glancing at me out of the corner of one eye , and I saw the slight skip in her step , alongside a small smile .
That would be the connection pad from Rain ’s tech , repurposed so that she apparently now had an extra eyeball extending from the back of her head .
Two .
Televisions along the corridor were showing the ending of the show that preceded our segment .   
This would be the one where a mix of adults and younger people went over the news of the day .   
The dynamic was that the adults tried to do it seriously , while the kids teased , joked , interfered and played pranks .
We were led to a room not far from the studio where things were being shot .   
The room had various seats , a horizontal green band running along the walls , and several televisions .   
There were some others gathered .   
At a glance , matching to the kids who were on the television , it was the kid actors’ parents .
“ We ’ll be starting shortly , ” the staff member in the cheap suit told us .   
“ If you have to use the facilities , please let staff know
so we can find you quickly if we need to get you on set .
”
“
Somehow this seems familiar , ” Ashley said .
“ If you need anything to eat or drink , there ’s a fridge over there with a clipboard on top .   
Write down what you took on the clipboard
so we know what to replace .   
Thank you , and we look forward to having you on the show !
”
Bubbles and cheer .   
The adults in the room were trying to block out the sound of our interruption and follow the final segment on the show .
It would ’ve been easy to be grumpy or dismissive .   
Instead , I put a smile on my face .   
“ Thank you very much .   
Listen , do you have any tips ?
”
“ Tips ?
”
I pulled the hood of my costume back .   
The others were finding seats , except for Swansong , who stood at empty space between
Lookout and I.    “
You watch these shows .   
I ’d bet a box of pastries the staff watches , you talk with each other , and you complain about how every guest does it wrong .   
I ’m nervous and this would help .
”
“
It would be bad manners for me to say .
”
“
I ’m not asking you anything about employers , only about the guests .
”
“
Just as I would n’t tell anyone anything about you , now that you ’re a guest in my care , I ca n’t speak about past or current guests .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .   
“ I can respect that .
”
“ We ’re broadcasting on television and radio both .   
Be clear in how you speak , because a share of our followers are going to follow by audio only .
”
“
Good point .   
I did n’t have to deal with that the last time I was on a show .
”
“
It ’s a different time .   
The panel segment that starts halfway through is where things get bad , if they get bad .   
That ’s your segment , by the way .   
Keep an eye on H.K. ” “ Hamza Kouri ?
” I asked .
“ You know the show !
”
I did n’t know the show .   
I ’d done research to try and figure out what we were getting into .   
“
Some .
”
She went on , “
Yes , he ’s one of the panelists .   
If you ’ve seen , you know sometimes he derails things , he always looks for his producer in the back of the room to get the go - ahead , or to make sure they have the clip while he ’s asking a question , hoping they give an answer that contradicts the clip .   
It used to go over real well , but it does n’t anymore .   
Once they find a schtick , they tend to overplay it or exaggerate it over time , and it ’s not playing so well now .   
He asks the question or launches into the speech , and the moment there ’s a weakness , he goes after it until someone makes him stop .   
He shouts people down , gets condescending .   
The majority of the audience does n’t like it , so he ’s supposed to be stopping .
”
“
He looks offscreen , then the trap ?   
Or the rant ?
”
“
Yes .   
Lynn likes jokes .   
Keep her laughing and the mood will stay good .   
John Combs is less predictable .   
He does his own research .   
If it ’s good research he hits hard .   
If not …
he ’s anyone you might see on the street , but with a nice jacket .
” I smiled .
“ I ’ve got to go run more errands to get us all ready .   
I will be back to check on you before you go in .
”
“
Thank you … you did n’t tell me your name .
”
“ Kaylar .
”
One maybe - ally in this whole mess , a bit of information .
Ashley had one raised eyebrow on her face as she looked at me .   
Everyone else was focusing on the television screens .
“
Ask someone for help , and they ’re in your debt .
”
“ Not the other way around ?
”
“ People want to be helpful , ” I said .
“ That might just be you .
”
“
It ’s true of all of us .   
Helping us made her feel more important .   
It made her a part of things .   
People are grateful for that .
”
“
There ’s no use in it for me , ” she said .   
“
I ’m not the type to ask for help .
”
“ If you ever feel the need , remember that the other person is probably waiting for you to do it .
”
She offered a dismissive sniff of the nose and shook her head .
The assorted parents were leaving the room , free to retrieve their children while the end credits rolled .   
Ads were playing on the one side of the screen .
Leaping from family - friendly news to something more controversial .
The door of the room with the green stripe opened .   
It was Gary Nieves who walked through .   
He was solidly built , his hair short and dyed to mask white hairs , his clothes rustic .   
With a wide waistband , he relied on suspenders to keep his pants up , and a tailored suit jacket to hide his suspenders .
“ I had half of an hour of screen time allotted to me today .   
They called to let me know they ’re bringing other people on .   
Now I have seven minutes .   
They want to leave room for us to debate and to let you say your piece .
”
I smiled a little .   
“
You brought her family into it , Mr. Nieves .
”
“ I would say she brought them into it by a campaign of extortion .   
They ’re small , vulnerable people in a world with terrible giants that exploit or compound vulnerabilities .
”
“
A terrible giant , ” Ashley said , her voice dry .   
She indicated Lookout , who was all of four - foot - ten and seventy five pounds .
Gary looked nettled .
“
Hi , ” Lookout said .
“ I think I ’ll wait elsewhere .
”
“
You should know my parents are not good people .   
If they sound sweet and convincing to you , they ’re just messing with you .   
They ’re really good at it .   
Kind of .
”
“ Excuse me , ” he said .
“
Um ! ”   
Lookout interrupted , with a loudness and urgency that seemed to catch him off guard .
He frowned .
“
Um .   
This is n’t that easy for me , but would you like to see the proof ?
”
“ You falsify evidence .   
Multiple sources , some ex - PRT , have confirmed this .
”
“ I can falsify video , because I ’m a camera tinker .   
Falsifying audio is a lot harder .   
I ’ve never been able to do it .   
Here .
”
“
I ’m
not-
” he started .
The video began playing .   
Audio .   
A sound like a single clap , a book being closed .   
Then a crash .   
Dishes breaking .   
A man ’s raised voice , muffled .
“ April twenty first , first year ,
” Kenzie ’s voice came through .   
“
Meet my parents , Mr. Julien Martin and Mrs. Irene Martin .   
Episode three .
”
“
This is moronic , ” Nieves said .
There were more impacts that could be heard over the audio from her phone .   
Footsteps .   
Even though they only existed on the phone , Lookout ’s shoulders drew together a fraction .
“ Kanzi , ” Julien said .   
There were more distant crashes .
“
I’m- I ’m Kenzie now .   
Please , I-
”
“ Stop , ” he said .   
“ Stop talking , stop interfering , stop interjecting yourself into things .
”
“ I filled the dishwasher .   
To help out !
”
“ You filled it wrong , and coming home to find it done is a reminder that you ’re here .   
Why are you here ?   
Why come to us ?
”
“
Because you kind of-
” there was a pause , a horrendous crash like the whole dishwasher rack had been torn out .   
“
You guys gave birth to me in the first place , and I was n’t sure where to go .
”
“ Kanzi , you-
”
“ Kenzie .
”
“ Kanzi !
”
he raised his voice , angry now .   
“
Stop talking back .   
You left .   
You told stories and we were sentenced probation , community service , classes , we spent time in jail .
”
“ I told the truth .
”
“
You left , and once we got past the legal hassles , things were better , ” Julien ’s voice came through .   
“
We were happy .   
You-
I have to imagine you were happier , wherever you ended up .   
Call it-
I do n’t know .   
We ’re a bad fit , us two and you .   
Separating us was a good thing , the hell we went through with jail and court aside .
”
“
I ’m in therapy now , I ’ve worked on my stuff .
”
“
I don’t- I can hear your mother coming .   
This is-
it ’s so stressful , Kanzi .   
Every day is stressful .
”
“
Are you going to stop her ?   
Stop this ?   
Protect me ?
”
“
Are you going to leave ?
”
“
No . ”
“
Then no .   
You ’re going to keep being you , and she ’s going to keep being her , and I would n’t survive ten days trying to get between- ”
A bang , door against wall .
Then noises , sounds of struggle .   
The sharp slapping sound of fist against flesh .
Gary looked away from the phone Lookout was holding up .
“
Look , please .   
Listen , ”
Lookout said .
The sound repeated .   
Three , four , five times .   
The arm that was holding up the phone was n’t steady , and it drew a figure eight in the air with the phone , almost , to the point that if there was anything new happening on the screen , I doubted Gary would be able to track it with his eyes .
“
You can falsify evidence , ” Gary said .   
His voice was tense .   
“
That ’s a big part of today ’s episode .
”
The sounds continued , scuffling .   
More hits on flesh .   
Kenzie ’s voice with each one , indistinct .
“
Stop that , ” Gary said .   
“ Please and thank you .   
You made your point .
”
“
Has she ?
” I asked .   
“
It ’s pretty major for her to show you this .
”
In front of me , Lookout shrugged , still holding up the phone .   
The sounds continued to play .   
She held her position like she was trying to stand still , but the waver in her hand failed her .
“
It ’s manipulative and it ’s questionable !
”
Gary said , with an anger above that which was warranted .
In the face of that anger , Lookout backed up a bit .   
The phone dropped to her side .   
Video still played on the screen .
“ I assume you ’re going to try to get them to put this on the air ?
”
“
No , ” Lookout said .   
“
I do n’t really want it to be seen by millions of people .   
That ’s not the me
I want to be in front of that many people .
”
“
That ’s a nice way of putting it , ” Swansong said .
“
Thank you .
”
“
For the last time , excuse me , ” Gary said .   
“ I would like to get my thoughts in order .
”
“
If you leave and you ignore this , ” Swansong said , “ Then you ’re no more a man than Julien Martin .   
You ’re worse .   
You ’re the kind of person who empowers the Julien Martins of the world .
”
He opened the door and walked through .
“ Be sure to let them know where you ’re going , ” I said , after him .   
“ They want to be able to find you as soon as they need you .
”
He ignored me , walking away .
I walked over and closed the door .
“ Dickbag , ” Natalie said .
Why had I wanted to say that ?   
Pettiness ?   
To make sure he knew he was n’t supposed to be walking away like that ?   
To inject some civility , however backhanded , and ensure he knew we were n’t wholly bad guys ?
I was n’t sure .   
I looked over at Lookout , who was exchanging murmured words with Swansong .   
She walked over to Capricorn , who had been largely absent from the conversation .
He was staring up at the television screen .   
The show had started , our part was n’t up for a bit , and he was following it with an almost unblinking stare , his jaw tense , fist clenched at one side .
“
Capricorn ?
” I asked .
“ I thought someone should watch , make sure we knew what we were going into , ” Byron said , in a voice that was quieter and softer than his usual .   
“
And if I looked away , I ’d do something stupid .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .   
“
That makes a lot of sense .
”
He looked at Lookout , who drew a step nearer , and reached out , hand on her shoulder .   
He pulled her close , until her helmet knocked against the armor at the side of his body , and he used one arm to hug her against the side of his body , tight .
She nodded , like she was answering a question .
The show was playing out with the narration of a true crime documentary .   
Laying out the facts .   
Kidnapped , tortured , no justice .   
It was n’t
Lookout
’s case , but as images lined up , showing victims with faces blurred out , silhouettes identifiable as her parents appeared .
A part of me ached to check online , make sure that the sky was n’t falling while we were tied up with this .   
We had too few people with far too little in the way of effective experience keeping an eye on things .   
Chris and Sveta were handling the organization .
That part of me did n’t have any motive force .   
I watched the episode , steeled myself .   
More words appeared on the screen .   
A golden flash .   
A silhouette .
The door opened , and Kaylar the staff guest organizer poked her head into the room .
“
You ’re on after the next commercial break , ” she said .   
“
Come on , hurry .   
Last chance to spruce up .   
Get your microphones .
”
Microphones clipped to our belts , my own threaded up through my armor like I tended to do my earbuds , we made our way into the hallway .   
Swansong could n’t wear one , so Lookout lagged behind , fiddling with her phone and periodically tapping at the projector plate .   
As Capricorn and Lookout caught up with me , I put a hand on
Lookout
’s shoulder , giving it a squeeze .   
She put her hand over mine .
The hallway , mundane and ordinary , but for a high ceiling that extended up to the reflective glass above the front section of the building .
Then the studio .   
The energy of a few hundred people in their seats , all chatting as commercials played , the set , the music , the iffy curtains that kept us out of view until our reveal .   
People had spotted us and were pointing , leaning toward one another to whisper and to get a better peek .
There was a buzzer , a red light , and conversation stopped .
Televisions throughout the area and screens on various cameras all showed the episode resuming .   
A flash of gold , a silhouette , and then the word : Answers .
The distortion of voice and bass with our proximity to speakers made words almost unintelligible .   
A hand gave me a light push .   
Kaylar .
And I stepped past the curtain , into the studio , wearing my A- costume with my makeup at an A and my hair done to an A+ .   
I stood tall and walked with confidence , my hand at Lookout
’s shoulder .
Swansong , an image , not the real her , made her debut in a way .   
A++ in poise , and that counted for enough .
And Capricorn , Byron up to this point , turned into Tristan to ‘ transform’ , to drop armor helmet , and to be presentable .   
He ’d done his hair differently , almost but not quite making the two sides of the parts into horn - like lengths , and he wore a mask that left his mouth free .








Our applause was like most of the applause at a golf match- far from uproarious , provided by expectation , not by free will .   
All light was reserved for the stage ; four fifths of the expansive room was dark .   
The audience were nebulous shapes , an audience manager with her back to us keeping everything in order .   
The audience was easy to lose track of , as the lights were directed our way , a brightness I had to look past .
The three hosts were standing in the center of the stage , in front of the arrangement of table and chairs .   
A woman at the front of this particular triumvirate- Lynn Chess .   
Black hair in a bun , bangs straight across the forehead , black suit jacket , a light blue silky top that cut straight across her cleavage , black skirt .   
She would have looked severe , if it were n’t for her expression and the animation in her eyes , a smile natural on her lips .   
The face of the group .
With the applause dying down , I could hear her talking .   
We did n’t have the benefit of speakers , and she did n’t do the talk - show thing of waiting for the applause to die down , gesturing and smiling all the while .
“ Breakthrough is an up and coming team , credited with identifying the threat to the inter - world portals and helping to save one of them …
”
Hamza Kouri and John Combs walked behind Lynn to greet us while Lynn talked .
Hamza was a big guy , maybe eighty pounds heavier than Gary Nieves , bald at the top with hair only at the sides and back of his head , a thick beard and thick eyebrows that were shot through with white .   
Dark brown spots flecked already deep brown , damaged skin .   
I would have taken him for homeless , going by the skin , hair , and the natural angry - at - the - world glower , but his clothes were nice , tailored well to his frame .
He shook Capricorn
’s hand , leaning in close to say something , one or two words .
“ …
Tonight , for those of you catching up , is the second episode of our series looking at the rogues , heroes , and villains of the city , and the dynamic that all of us are having to adjust to …
”
Hamza shook my hand , clasping it in both of his , leaning in close enough that I could smell cigars .   
An expensive habit to have , after the end of the world , when supply was next to nil .   
He was barely audible .   
“ Good to have you .
”
“
Thanks for having us , ” I murmured back , offering a smile .
Lynn continued , “ … talked about duty , about law , and the shifts in attitude that seemed to surround our heroes in the years just before
Gold Morning … ”
Hamza , where he ’d bent over me and Capricorn , stood very straight and stuck his hand down at an angle for Lookout .   
She shook it , her hand disappearing in his .   
She tugged , and he bent down , and she said something , while pointing at Swansong .
I shook John Combs’ hand .   
He was a good looking guy , clean shaven , black hair styled down to the strand , button - up shirt with no tie worn under a suit jacket .   
When I glanced down at his hand to shake it , I saw his shoes .   
Earth
Bet shoes , like Hamza ’s cigars .   
His grip was aggressively firm , but he actually smiled as he murmured a pleasantry .
“ …
Tonight , our focus shifts to the present , and how the authorities are handling this , if they ’re handling it at all .   
Today we ’re focusing on the question marks .   
Our investigative reporters brought three cases to our attention .   
A pair of killers in black raincoats .   
A husband and wife are held hostage by a family member that was taken into PRT custody years ago .   
An actual , literal warlord rules over a disconnected section of the city , and it ’s not the only one , ” Lynn said .   
Her eyes lit up .   
“ One of the alleged culprits is with us tonight .
”
I raised an eyebrow at that .
John had wrapped up the handshakes .   
He touched Lynn ’s arm as he moved back to center , joining Hamza .   
“
Joining us again at our table tonight , we have the recent candidate and contender for the city ’s first run at Mayor , and an outspoken , authoritative voice when it comes to figuring out where the costumed fit into things .   
Mr. Gary Nieves .
”
The woman who was managing the audience gave the signal , arms in movement as she encouraged .   
They applauded .   
More applause than we got .
Gary Nieves approached .   
To my eyes , he was a touch red in the face , but I was n’t sure if that would translate to the cameras .
We were indicated to take our seats , while the hosts greeted Gary Nieves .   
The arrangement of chairs and table were an ‘ L’ shape , the short leg being an arrangement of four puffy chairs , the long leg being a single table .   
They faced the audience , while we faced them .
Cameras were moving , tracking our every movement .   
I smiled , keenly aware of my hair , my expression , and my body language .   
I was aware of the others’ body language and expressions , where visible .
I saw Tristan hesitate a moment , then step away from the chairs .   
Toward Gary Nieves .   
Wearing a smile that conveyed I had full confidence in Capricorn , I followed him with less - than - full confidence .   
Past the three hosts , to Gary Nieves .
As the hosts finished with Gary , Tristan reached him , hand extended to shake .   
Cameras moved to follow the exchange , and I could see the fraction - of - a - second hesitation in Gary .
He did n’t want to shake Tristan ’s hand ?   
Fear ?   
Or optics in the eyes of the audience ?
He could n’t refuse without looking like the bad guy , so he did accept the shake .   
With no helmet on , only a mask around the upper half of his face , Tristan was free to flash him a winning smile .
As Tristan turned away , Gary shook the hand he ’d used to shake Tristan
’s , not so much like it was gross , but
like Tristan had hurt him .   
I could see the hitch in Tristan
’s stride as he spotted it at the last second before turning completely away .   
He met my eyes .
I was pretty sure I could tell from his expression that he had n’t squeezed Gary ’s hand .   
It was a power play to make us look bad , in exchange for a power play intended to toy with Gary ’s optics .   
A fine distinction , to discern if Tristan was resentful because of lingering feelings from Gary and Lookout a few minutes ago , or if it was because he ’d just been played .
Then we were walking in opposite directions .   
Tristan walked to the chairs .   
I walked over to Gary to shake his hand .   
I leaned in closer when I did have his grip .   
I murmured .   
“
Going to pretend like I squeezed your hand too hard , Mr. Nieves ?
”
There was no smile , no change in expression , only a firm shake .   
I smiled at him .
The others were seated as I strode over to the chairs .   
We ’d picked good people for this , and all of us came across as confident , and our team looked genuinely good .   
Even Lookout , who had the most reason to be nervous , gave nothing away .
I knew she was good at pretending things
were okay .   
The tell was in what she did , action - wise .   
We ’d have to be mindful .
Tristan had taken the seat closest to the table .   
The next seat , mine , was empty , followed by Lookout and Swansong at the end .
Conversely , at the table , Hamza was the closest to us , followed by John , Lynn , and then Gary Nieves at the end .   
Given the description I ’d gotten of Hamza , and my surface assessment from the segments of show I ’d watched to research , Hamza was a bad pairing to put so close to Tristan .   
They were both too prone to butt heads .
This show was a very specific kind of machine .   
I ’d seen fragments of it before , and it had n’t been the kind of show that I enjoyed .   
Investigative journalism leading into segments with the panel , exploring what was uncovered .   
It was too aggressive a show , leaving me uneasy and tired-
and I did n’t watch television to be uneasy and tired .
I ’d also studied two episodes , my finger hammering the ‘ skip 5 seconds ahead’ key at times to get to the next scene , where I could let it play at normal speed , see the tone , read the expressions , and see how the guest or topic were handled .   
It looked like they always had the initial segment , setting the tone with an easy to understand story .   
Then the guests , or the expert like our Gary Nieves here would get a chance to say their piece .   
A slow roll , getting the audience used to things , and then the steady pressure , like they were interrogating a witness , looking for cracks or discrepancies .   
John liked to create them , Hamza liked to attack them , and Lynn managed the tone .   
However things ended up in the end , the audience would often find one of the three personalities hosting this show to be a rough approximate of their own feelings on the matter , even though all three were on the same general wavelength .
They feigned being something between a friendly talk show and a more intellectual panel show , but if they had an excuse , things tended to devolve into the attack dog dynamic .   
Like the personalities , the show ’s identity was nebulous enough that a given viewer could claim it was any one of the three things- friendly , intellectual , or aggressive problem solving .
For them , success meant sticking to their gameplan .   
On our end , doing this right meant avoiding any sign of weakness , reinforcing ourselves and each other , and holding on to the card up our sleeve- the promise of information .   
We had the advantage of knowing how they ’d operate .
“ Team Breakthrough , ” Hamza said .   
“ Or
is it only Breakthrough ?
”
“
Either is fine , ” Tristan said .
“ And
do you want me to introduce you , or will you introduce yourselves ?
”
“
I ’m
Capricorn , ” Tristan said .   
“
This is- ”
“ Victoria , ”
I said .   
I pulled my hood down , trying not to mess up my hair in the process .   
“ Antares in costume .
”
“
And you wear no mask , ” Lynn said .   
“
You use your name freely ?   
That ’s interesting .
”
“
No mask , ” I said .   
“
I never had the benefit of a secret identity .
”
Lookout was removing her own helmet .   
When she lowered it , I saw that her face was n’t her usual .
“
I ’m
Lookout , ” she said .   
“
I do have a secret identity ,
so I ’m camouflaging my face a bit .
”
“
That ’s perfectly fine , ” Lynn said .   
“ Thank you for coming on ,
Lookout .   
I know this must all be intimidating .
”
“
It ’s funny , lights and cameras do n’t bother me much , ”
Lookout said .
Lynn tittered .   
“ Cameras being your power , of course .
”
Lookout smiled .   
“ Yep .
”
“
And your fourth member would be-
”
“ Swansong , ” Swansong said .   
She sat comfortably in her seat , one leg folded over the other .   
“
I ’m only here in spirit .
”
“ Only here in spirit ?   
That ’s odd , ” Hamza said , with an inflection on ‘ odd’ .
Swansong smiled .
“
She ’s sort of like a teddy bear I brought with me for security , except I ’m too grown up for that , ” Lookout said .   
“
So I brought someone cooler than a stuffed animal .
”
“
I ’m glad
I ’m cooler than a stuffed animal ,
” Swansong said .
Lookout nodded .
“
I ’m surprised you came in costumes ,
” John told us .   
“
I imagined suits and masks .
”
Not an angle of attack or criticism I ’d anticipated .   
It made sense , in a way .   
Delegitimize , disarm , call reasonable and natural things into question .
“ That would have bad implications , ” I said .   
“
The aesthetic you ’re talking about is a popular villain thing .   
Ambassadors in Boston , Dark Society down the East coast , there was a group of weapons dealers called the Brokers …
And of course the Elite who were the biggest American villain gang .   
The exception on the hero side would be the Suits , and even they had costumes for serious events where they needed the extra pockets , armor , and everything else .
”
“
So interesting , ” Lynn said .   
“
This is all the sort of thing you have to consider .
”
“ We would n’t want to borrow from the Suits’
look either , ” Tristan added .   
“
The members of their team who were n’t the first casualties of Gold Morning were some of the bravest fighters .   
We respect them too much to plagiarize .
”
Good .   
Gold Morning .   
We ’d get there sooner or later , and making it something we were talking about would make it feel less like a cold splash of water in the audience
’s faces .
It did n’t change that we had to manage Lookout ’s situation and her family .
I was alright with Capricorn taking the lead on this thus far .   
He ’d been following the opening segment of the show while we ’d been facing down Gary .
“
I ’m sure our guests are wondering who you are
, ” Lynn said , leaning onto the table .   
“
Breakthrough is relatively new to the scene .
”
“ As a team , yes , ” Tristan said .   
“
As individuals ?   
All of us here have a few years under our belts .
”
“
Tell us about that , ” Lynn said .
Gary was staring us down .   
He did n’t look happy .   
Minutes spent on us and on small talk here were minutes he could n’t do his thing .   
Good .
I answered so Tristan did n’t have to .   
“ Speaking for myself , I was born to a family of heroes .   
My mom , dad , sister , my two cousins , two uncles , aunt , all had powers .   
I grew up with it .   
My boyfriend was a hero .   
Being a hero was my life , past , present , and future .
”
“
Was ? ”
Hamza asked .
“
Ah .   
That point in time was a past life , and a different me , ”
I said .   
“
A majority of the people I just listed are dead or gone .   
Some died fighting in Gold Morning .   
Some died prior .   
Some … left .
”
“
You ’re referring to your sister , who went to the Birdcage , ” John Combs said .
Asshole .   
I wanted to say something to that , and I could n’t .   
But was this his plan ?   
To just drop things like this on us until something cracked ?
“
I was thinking of my uncle , ” I lied .   
“
His partner was killed because of our lack of secret identities .   
I think he could n’t stay after that .
”
“ I ’m sorry to hear that , ” Lynn said .
There was strategy in play .   
To anticipate that they would go on the offensive , and to disarm and lay groundwork first .   
Paint a picture of who we were , then use that pictured ground as terrain we could fortify .
Hammering in that the other hero teams were doing good work , solidarity , being sure to express that we wanted to be heroes .   
All were meant to cut off avenues of attack .
Still , I could n’t ignore the sister remark .
“
Thank you .   
I was young , but it was hard at the time .   
A tragedy .   
My sister too .
We ’d just lost almost half of our family , the Slaughterhouse Nine showed up .   
She broke down .   
She went to the Birdcage because she did n’t trust herself .
”
It was as kind of a response as I could come up with .   
I felt a creeping sort of dread with the notion that she might be looking , watching , reading something into this , maybe even showing up unexpectedly .
“
And you went to the hospital at the same time .   
That ’s hard , ” John Combs said .   
“
She ’s free of the Birdcage now , of course .   
All of them are .
”
He went straight to the hospital .   
Asshole .   
He had to know about the Wretch-
the one I ’d been , not the one I carried with me every day , now .
“
You seem very interested in that one family member of mine .
”
Stupid .   
Defensive .
“
She did go to the Birdcage .   
That ’s for only a select few , ” John Combs said .
“ John and I were talking about this earlier .
”
Hamza ’s voice was deep , and he was slower with his words , like he could somehow leave us less words and time in the process .   
“
The Birdcage was emptied out on Gold Morning , so there would be more firepower out there .   
Your sister was among those released .   
Those are threats that are active in the city now .   
Do you feel safe , knowing this ?
”
It was hard to find words , because they were taking this angle .   
Tristan looked at me like he was checking to see that I was okay , ready to jump in .
I beat him to it .   
I did n’t want to look weak in front of an audience .   
I could n’t afford for myself to see me as that weak .   
“
I feel like I want to do everything I can to help others feel safe .
”
“ Amen , ” Tristan said .
“ People do n’t feel safe , ” Gary Nieves said .   
“ If that ’s your goal , you ’re failing .
”
“ We ’re still starting out , ” Swansong said .
“
But you ’ve been heroes for some time , by your own admission , ” Gary said .
“ I can tell you I was out there in construction , helping to build shelters , ” Tristan said .   
“ Victoria was out there in the patrol block , using what she knows about villains to keep people safe .   
Swansong was getting care because she was n’t in one piece , but she was helping authorities with research on powers .
”
“
And then we have Lookout , ” John Combs stated .   
There was weight to the sentence .
Tristan had walked into that one .
“
Hi , ” Lookout said .   
“
Mostly school for me .
”
“
More than school , as the allegations go , ” John said .
Hamza did n’t give us a chance to respond before adding his own commentary .   
“ When we started looking into the story with Lookout ’s family , you all told us you wanted to come onto the show , to argue your teammate ’s side .
”
“ I hope it does n’t come down to arguing , Mr. Kouri , ” Capricorn said .
“ When we decided on Breakthrough ’s direction , the goal was to communicate , it ’s why we ’re here , ” I said .   
“
We just want to make sure everyone has as much information as possible .
Hamza was ready with an answer , voice angry .   
“
And for our audience out there , let ’s not lose sight of who ‘ we’ is supposed to represent , when you talk about your group .   
Two murderers , sitting here .
”
“
That ’s not right , ” Lookout said .
“ The information is out there .   
Team Reach .   
The junior member Capricorn was arrested on accusations of murder , by his own teammates , no less .   
We called one of them earlier tonight to corroborate the facts .
”
“
Hey , ” Lookout said .
“ Hamza , ” I said , my voice firm .   
“
If you’ll- ”
“
Let me finish , ” he said .   
“
Swansong ’s presence her raises an interesting question .   
She bears a startling resemblance to not one , but two murderers who are supposed to be in lockup right now .   
I have to worry about how many there are .   
We also have a little girl who was terrorizing her parents with threats of extortion , and then yourself , a heroine who did n’t save her hometown , did n’t save her boyfriend , did n’t save her many family members who were killed during the various major incidents , and who could n’t or would n’t stop her sister from , as you put it , breaking down , putting lives at risk .   
I do my research , Victoria .
”
I drew in a breath .   
The faint noise of audience was enough to take the oxygen out of that breath .   
I tried not to let it throw me .   
This was fine .   
Expected .   
Just … more of a gut punch than anticipated .   
I needed- Hamza interrupted my thoughts .   
“
I could believe that Lookout , this child here , was n’t to blame , if this is the company she ’s been made to keep .
”
“
That ’s not fair , ” Lookout said , and her voice was almost lost in the noise of the crowd .   
The audience manager was motioning for them to shush , and a red light flared near the ceiling .   
I imagined it was an order to shut the fuck up .
The noise level made it hard to jump in with a rebuttal .
It was a bit of a reversal of the dynamic I ’d observed with the show .   
Three different show identities , between its face as a friendly talk show , an intellectual panel of experts , and a pit for enemies to be targeted and torn up .
“
You named a lot of points .   
Would you like to name one or two of your favorites for us to address ?
” I asked .
“
The point is that you , as a group , and parahumans , as a collective , are deeply flawed and unhealthy , ” Gary Nieves said .   
“
Two children in black raincoats conduct a ritual with peers that were chained to a radiator and a bed , respectively .   
Through this ritual , they get powers .
”
“
That is not how you get powers , ” I said .
That got me a few raised eyebrows .
“
Metaphorically , then ?   
They seemed to believe it worked for them .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“ Parahumans are taking on positions of leadership- many corner worlds , many of the refugee groups outside of America , and many of the roaming factions are controlled by parahumans .   
We already know of one whole Earth which is under the sway of a parahuman and her court .   
I can tell you that as someone who has had to deal with parahumans from the fringes , every single one I ’ve met has deep - seated problems .
”
Tristan had to twist to get a good look at Gary .   
His head bent at an angle , getting close to the points of golden spikes at my shoulder , in his attempt to see the man .   
“
This was after Gold Morning ?
”
“ Most that I met were after , yes .
”
“
Then that is n’t a fair assessment .   
Everyone‘s suffering and dealing with deep - seated problems these days .
”
Lynn offered a one - note laugh .   
“
That ’s a point , sad as it is .
”
She smiled and laughed while calling it sad .   
It was disconcerting , taken in stride with the fact that she was working with Hamza and John to undermine us , but in a softer , harder - to - tackle way .
Leaning forward on his elbows , Gary made a fist and then clenched the fist in his other hand .   
His voice was low as he said , “ The idea that we might have a leader who has political or economic power , these deep seated problems , and a power ?   
An ability that sets them apart from the rest of us ?   
That ’s a complete and utter nightmare , and it ’s one we ’ve seen in play countless times over the years .
”
“
And so you attack us ?
” I asked .   
“
The answer to solving this problem lies in collaborating , sharing information , and mutual understanding , not in attacking .
”
“ The goal is n’t to attack you , ” Gary said .   
“ We would like to use you -a team that is on the surface very presentable and helpful- as a broader illustration .
”
It was Swansong who replied .   
“
You wanted to use Lookout as your illustration .   
She ’s example number two out of three .   
You ’re attacking a kid .
”
“
We ’re focusing on a parahuman of interest .   
That she ’s younger than some does n’t matter if she has immense power .
”
“ I make cameras and boxes , ” Lookout said .   
“
People keep acting like
I ’m something special .
”
“
You are special , Lookout , ” I said .   
“
But it ’s only because you work way too damn hard for your own good .
”
“ Thank you .
”
“
The allegations are that she terrorized her parents , controlling every aspect of their lives for over a year , ” Hamza said .
“
And ?
” I asked .
Shit , there went civility .
“ I beg your pardon ?
”
“ Why does it matter , Mr. Kouri ?   
What do you want that you are n’t getting ?
”
“ Consequences , ” he said , his voice hard .   
Lookout shrunk back into her seat .
Swansong ’s voice was soft , compared to her usual , and softer still in contrast to Hamza Kouri ’s aggressive tone , “ Victoria discovered the problem recently .   
Within the hour , she was talking to authorities .   
Authorities know the details .   
They chose to arrest the parents and leave Lookout with a city - appointed guardian .   
Consequences were meted out .
”
“ Based on the say - so of a girl who can falsify her own evidence .   
She ’s altering her own face right now , ” Gary said .
He ’d already tried this .   
I answered , “ It was a decision made by people who have access to all of the evidence .   
All of it , including paperwork she did n’t have access to .   
I ’m sorry ,
but no .   
You ca n’t smile and say it ’s fine that she ’s protecting her identity one minute , then use it as a point against her the next .   
And it ’s a special sort of unkind to pretend there ’s something wrong with protecting identities when I just told you what the consequences are , less than ten minutes ago .   
I ’ve lost a family member .
”
“
That ’s not what I was saying .
”
“
You ’re attacking us on the grounds that we ’re too unreliable , too dangerous ,
” I said .   
“
But you ’re taking allegations as fact and then running away with it .   
Lookout , once we realized what was going on , was removed from the unhealthy dynamic .   
Her parents are in custody
and she ’s safe in the hands of the City .   
The court cases I ’m aware of are in progress , but
yeah , sometimes
when you ’re dealing with monsters , lives are lost .   
The courts will arbitrate .
”
“ If they have untainted information , ” Gary Nieves said .
“ You wanted to be mayor , ” Swansong said .   
“
Yet you ca n’t trust your own city
’s information ?   
What would you have done if you won ?   
Would you have second guessed every one of their decisions , until you were ousted , retired , or resigned ?
”
“
Let ’s not be hostile , ” Lynn said .
“ I would have second guessed the ones involving parahumans who can distort reality or records .
”
“ They do good work , ” Tristan said .   
“ Police , patrol block , courts , fire , medical , they ’re doing the best they can , given the circumstance .   
Admirable , considering circumstances .   
And I ’ll tell you this-
we ’re going to give our all to do our own share .   
That ’s what gets us through the colder months .
”
“
That ’s a heavy topic of its own , ” John said .
“
It ’s imminent , ” Tristan said .   
“
A month or two .   
You want to focus on a twelve year old girl ?
” Nieves leaned forward .   
“ If traffic is limited , doors are closed , and this girl has the ability to get inside homes , steal or kill , and get away , hiding her evidence trail , yes .   
So long as the monsters are among us , yes .
”
Hamza was nodding along .   
The other two were n’t disagreeing .
“
I ’m not going to say it ’s all perfect , ” I told them .   
“
But I ’m going to try to spell out how I see this .   
It ’s going to involve sharing some stuff that others have n’t talked about .   
About powers .   
And about Gold Morning .
”
I could see the audience shift at that .   
My heart beat faster .
“ We could just walk away , ” Swansong said .   
“ If they want to condemn us , let them .   
But we do n’t owe them this , and some of it is going to come down on our heads .
”
I shook my head .
“
Okay , ” she said .
“ I grew up into powers , ”
I told the people at the table .   
I could see expressions of concern .   
“
I ’ve been studying them for a while .   
I studied enough to know that there were huge gaps in our knowledge and those gaps were barely closing with every passing year .   
Where did powers come from ?   
How do we get them ?   
Now we know .   
Gold Morning was n’t just destruction .   
It was answers .
”
“
And you did n’t share , ” John Combs said .
“
For decades , people who told about other major secrets were visited by a bogeyman who targeted capes .   
It was someone who could kill or disappear the invincible , outsmart the masterminds , and survive things that would kill or stop just about anything .   
Whatever they planned to talk about would be mended shortly .
”
“
Yeah , ” Tristan said .   
“
Then Gold Morning happened .   
There were people here and there who talked about it , but most stayed quiet .   
Pressure from other groups , and most of the ones with a podium to talk about it had the sense to stay quiet , because the bogeyman would act on this kind of thing .
Thank you for the reminder , Tristan , I thought .
Lookout ’s hand went over mine on my armrest , squeezing .
“
We had glimpses through Scion ’s eyes , when our powers manifested or when certain effects came into play .   
During these times , we saw things as he saw them .   
It includes millions of fragments raining down on us , invisible to the naked eye .   
Each of those fragments … a power .   
We were made to forget , but when Gold Morning happened , we were able to remember .   
He stopped caring so much about perfection , and he became something else entirely .   
Not that he was ever human .
”
“
What was he ?   
An alien ?   
A demon ?
”
Gary Nieves asked .
“
He was an alien from another reality , more distant from us than Gimel is from Bet , as best as we can tell , ” I said .   
“
He moved between realities like we walk through doorways .   
Something went wrong with what he was trying to set up , and he lost his partner .
”
“
He had a partner ?   
There ’s another one of these out there ?
”
“
Dead in the crash landing , we think , ” I said .
“
What ’s the point , then ?   
Or was that broken up in this crash too ?
” John asked .
“
To experiment with what we ’re given .   
To be open and vulnerable for effective study .
”
“
A real justification about why you ’re all so screwed up ?
” Gary asked .
“
That’s- ” I started .   
I was aware of all of the eyes on me .   
I smiled .   
“
No .   
Because we have definite proof to the contrary .
”
“ That you ’re not all screwed up , with some alien god as an excuse ? ?
”
“ Some of us , probably , ” I said .   
“
But the reality is that Scion , the strongest of us , who used powers to generate himself a body and who gave himself a set of powers that none of the rest of us could touch … .
we beat him .   
We were nudged here and there to take part in his games , to fight amongst ourselves we were given powers and limited in ways that did n’t let us even try to hurt him .   
He was insurmountable and we … surmounted .
”
“ We won , ” Tristan said .   
“
If you have any doubts about how we were ‘ programmed’ , look to the scholars for answers .   
It ’s subtle if it ’s there at all .   
Focus instead on the fact that when it all came down to it , we concentrated our efforts , looking past petty squabbles .   
It took a nameless cape to grab us all and drag people from every corner of reality to reinforce .   
That cape tried to keep us , but when we broke free , we kept fighting him , and we fought as one .
”
I nodded at that .
A nameless cape .   
Taylor Hebert .   
Skitter .   
A bug controller from my hometown .
We were too spooked at the idea that we might draw her attention and start that whole engine back into motion to mention her by name .
Best to leave it alone .
“ We won , ” Swansong said .   
“
We defeated the embodiment of that impulse .   
We can and will defeat it in ourselves .
”
I could see it in the audience and in the hosts of the B - TV evening show .   
A split , even a fissure , running through them .   
In the gloom past the bright lights , there were people who might ’ve been grateful , yes , but there were many who were angry .








The television studio had been flipped on its head for the time being .   
The hosts were quiet , the audience was loud with chatter , and the stage was n’t so bright with the lights on above the audience .   
We were n’t the focus and we could breathe and we were simultaneously under an immense pressure- not trying to find the flow of things and steer with it , but caught with nothing to keep us afloat , the waters rushing away to gather strength for the incoming wave .
It would have been easier if the show had continued .   
Instead , monitors intended more for the hosts showed the ad break and a countdown until we were live again .
Lynn , Hamza and John Combs were all talking together , with two members of the studio staff leaning in close .   
The audience talked about what they ’d heard .
Ninety seconds .
“
Are you doing okay ?
”
I asked Lookout , my hand over my microphone .
She nodded , doing the same with her microphone .   
“
The pressure ’s off me , right ?
”
“
They ’ll return to it , probably , ” Capricorn said .   
He leaned one forearm across on one knee , his weight shifted hard to the right- he sat at the leftmost end of our row of four chairs , so he had to work to get in close enough to talk to us and not be overheard .   
“
They prepared for a show with your family as an example scenario .   
Right now , they ’re looking for a way to right their ship , and that stuff they prepared is a tool at their disposal .
”
“ Ugh , ” Kenzie said .
“
It ’s not the end of the world if it happens , ” I said .   
“
It sucks , do n’t get me wrong , I do n’t want anyone attacking you .   
But we planned for it , we have a strategy , there should n’t be any big surprises .
” She nodded .
“
Let ’s think other approaches .   
Do they hit any of us on credibility ?
” I asked .   
“
Me keeping my powers covert in Patrol block ?
”
“ Weak , ” Capricorn said .
“
Maybe .   
They just need to cast doubt , ” I said .   
I eyed the timer on the monitors .   
Two minutes , twenty - one seconds .
“
It ’s weak doubt .   
Capes keep identities secret .   
You have a reason for doing it , ” Capricorn said .
“
Okay .   
Who else do they target ?   
Bait one of us into talking , then attack them ?
”
“
Mute my microphone , ” Swansong told Lookout .
“
Done .
”
“ If they choose me , I deflect .   
I ’m only here in spirit ,
” Swansong said , with a slight smile on her face .   
“
I ’m one of several clones .
”
“
Good , ” I said .   
I glanced at the countdown .   
I put a casual smile on my face , in case the audience was fixated on me .   
Best to look confident .   
“ Capricorn ?
”
“
I ’m vulnerable .   
Not so much credibility as … dark .   
Going back to my murder charge .   
Making me out to be a bad guy .
”
“
We talked about that , briefly .   
I would have liked actual details , so I can back you up , but … ”
“
But my brother wants it left in the past , ” Capricorn said .   
“ If it comes up , I ’ll deal with it .
”
“
Do n’t hand them the ball , ” I told him .   
“ Morality , that stuff , do n’t bring it up , they ’ll use it to launch into the topic .
” Capricorn nodded .
I looked at the clock .   
One minute , fifteen seconds .
“ Attacks on us miss the point , ” Swansong said .   
“
They could do worse ?
”
“
How ?
”
Lookout asked .
“ They could make us leave .
”
Kicking us out during the ad break ?   
My initial thought was that it would fail .   
On rumination , though … what would we even do ?   
They had the platform , and we had n’t had a good chance to lay out what we wanted to say .   
They ’d cut to ad break shortly after my pronouncements about Gold Morning .
If we were ejected … it ’d be a complete and utter mess .   
Point missed .   
They ’d get raised eyebrows , but we would be the group that had put out some problematic info and then left before owning it or taking the time to defend ourselves .
Swansong nodded , more or less in tune with my line of thought .   
It would be bad .
“ Shit , ” Capricorn said .   
“
Let ’s hope it ’s too late for that .
”
The lights around the audience went dark .   
Little boxes mounted above and in front of the audience glowed yellow , a word illuminated in the sudden gloom .   
On the televisions , the countdown was in the final twenty seconds , as an ad for a show on the same network played .
Only seconds .   
They could n’t kick us out if there were only five seconds left .
Kaylar , our friendly assistant in the cheap suit from earlier , practically skipped as she left the conversation with the hosts .   
My heart skipped a beat .
How would we handle this ?   
Did we stay despite being asked to leave ?
Three seconds .   
Two .   
One .   
The audience went quiet .   
The lights and focus were on us , but the wave of response had n’t hit yet .
The monitors shifted to the show
’s logo .   
‘
Hard Boil’ .    
‘ TV - B’ .   
Staff hurried away from their huddle with the hosts , glancing at Kaylar .
On the monitors , they segued straight to a video recap .
We were n’t on screen .
“
Guys , ” Kaylar said .   
“
Just doing my job here .
”
“
Hi , ” I said .
Her job was either to tell us we had to vacate ,
or- “
Are you doing alright ?   
Do you need anything ?   
Water ?
”
We shook our heads .
“
It ’s going well so far .   
Keep it up !
”
With that , she was gone , fleeing the stage before the focus came back to us .   
She ’d occupied our attention in the moments the clip was playing on the screen .   
Silhouettes of a couple , the lighting from behind enough to show the very edges of their hair , heads , necks , and shoulders , but hide their faces and identifying details .   
Julien and Irene .
“ … always difficult , ” Julien said .   
“
She told the teachers stories .   
Babysitters too .
”
“ We sent her to camps .   
Things after school , what was it ?   
Piano ?   
Art ?   
Computers ?
”
“
Yeah .   
Soccer , but she was n’t one for sports , especially team sports .   
She did n’t make friends at any of the classes or camps .   
Never brought anyone home from school .   
We gave up on taking her to those after a while .   
She was n’t getting anything out of it .
” I looked over at Lookout .   
She glanced up at me and smiled .
I gave her shoulder a rub .
John Combs’ voice could be heard , interviewing the pair as part of the pre - recorded clip playing for the audience .   
“
I ’ve wondered whether people know , even before it happens .   
Were these parahumans quiet , strange , or aggressive ?   
Did you think she might be different back then ?
”
“ Quiet and strange .   
I never thought about powers or that she might be the kind of person who gets them , but it makes sense in retrospect .
”
“ If we ’d suspected , we would have done things differently when she found us again .   
The last we ’d heard she was in the hands of the authorities , then the world ended , and with no warning she appeared in front of us .
”
“ Spinning more stories for people who were overwhelmed trying to assign people houses and work .
”
“ And the video manipulation .   
That was our first hint that something was wrong .
”
I leaned over to Lookout and whispered , “ Are you sure you do n’t want to talk about what they did ?
”
“ I ’d really rather not , ” she whispered back .   
“ Not on television , in front of everyone .
”
“ -false videos ?
”
John was asking , in the clip .
“ Putting us in scenes where we were n’t , making it look like we committed crimes , ” Julien responded .   
“
A preteen girl , she found us
and she trapped us .
”
“
She trapped them , ” John said .   
His actual voice , and not the clip .   
On the monitors , he stared into the cameras , his face severe .   
His expression changed , a slight smile .   
“
And we ’re back .
”
Lights gave the go - ahead for the audience to applaud .   
Cameras moved , slowly turning to keep us centered in the shots .   
The clapping had more energy than it had had when we ’d made our appearance .   
When Gary had made his .
“
Now , that clip was recorded yesterday , and obviously we did n’t know about this big story you would be giving us all tonight .   
It ’s impressive and monumental
if true , we will get back to it .   
But first , can we talk about Lookout ?   
What ’s your reaction on seeing that ?
”
“
Um .   
That ’s tricky , ” Lookout stumbled .
“
Enraged , ”
Swansong said , her voice cold .
“
That ’s a strong word , ” Hamza retorted .
“
It ’s a good word , ” Lookout said .   
“
Um , and thank you for caring , Swansong .   
I got tired of being enraged or feeling much of anything about what my parents do , a long time ago .   
I do n’t really try to understand them .
”
“
A breakdown in communication ?
”
Hamza asked .   
“
A lack of appropriate emotion , be it shame or empathy , can suggest certain labels .
”
“ Those labels you ’re implying do n’t apply to kids , ” I said .   
“
Let ’s get real here .
”
“
That ’s what we ’re trying to do tonight , ” Lynn said , all enthusiasm and verve .
“ Getting real .   
We ’re getting answers- about what happened on Gold Morning .   
And as part of that , I want to know what it ’s really like , to live with a parahuman ?   
Sometimes we hear from …
what ’s the term ?   
Cape wives ?   
And cape husbands , I suppose .   
Legend had one .
”
“ As the slang goes online , even the men are ‘ cape wives’ , ” I said .   
“
But I do n’t think that ’s important .
”
“ Amen to that , ” Capricorn said .
“
There ’s no cape parent , is there ?
”
Lynn asked , glossing past us .   
“ They do n’t have a voice .
”
Hamza ’s heavy voice cut in , following up and speaking over Capricorn ’s response .   
“
There is n’t a guidebook , and there ’s definitely no guide for what happens when the child gains incredible power and flips the script on the parent , seizing authority , asserting control , deciding how the parent lives their lives .   
What they can wear , what ’s served for dinner , the chores …
”
“ My parents are finally where they belong , ” Lookout said .   
“
They ’re in jail .
”
“
With , ” I added , interjecting in much the way Hamza had , “ the courts fully aware that Lookout can manipulate video .   
At a time when they were processing dozens of Fallen and pushing other cases off to the side , they had witness testimony , video footage and past records , and they decided it was best to incarcerate .   
Despite being overloaded .   
Make of that what you will .
”
“
But we ca n’t know , ” Hamza said .
“ The decks are stacked , ” Gary said .   
“
Victoria ’s sister was in the Birdcage for good reason-
now she ’s free .   
Capricorn was facing trial , with proceedings benched indefinitely , until the end of the world erased all records .   
There are members of the Slaughterhouse Nine who are alive and free .
”
“
There were no records , no facilities , and there was no organization .   
By necessity , it was treated as a second chance for everyone .
”
“ Bullshit , ” Gary retorted .
Lynn cleared her throat .
“ Bull , ” Gary said .
“
It ’s not bull .   
That was the reality , ” Capricorn said .   
“
There are multiple criminals out there that I helped put away who are free now .   
they ’re out there and I have to worry about them .
”
“
Same here , ” I said .
“
Me too ,
” Lookout said .   
“
I was more behind the scenes though , and the Wards kept me away from big stuff , so it ’s less obvious
I played a role in getting anyone arrested .
”
“
It ’s bull because the second chances are n’t being evenly distributed .   
Two parents are arrested based on their past records , as you said earlier .   
New , possibly falsified evidence , witnesses who may or may not be biased , and past records .   
No wiping the slate clean there .
”
“ The slates are n’t wiped clean , ” Capricorn said .
I tensed .    
I was worried about them delving more aggressively into Capricorn ’s backstory , if he got more moral - focused and put his jaw out for the return smack .   
The way we were discussing things , there were a half - dozen mysteries surrounding us .   
Who we were , what we ’d done .   
Delving into any of the mysteries would satisfy the audience , and we did n’t want them chewing on that .
He seemed to notice I ’d tensed , and did n’t elaborate .
“
What are they , then ?   
It seems one sided , ” Lynn said .
“
The past still exists , ” Swansong picked up the slack .   
“
We look past it until there ’s a reason to bring it up .   
If you screw up , you lose your second chance , and it ’s fair game again .
”
Gary shook his head .   
“
We give this pass even to a walking , talking , potentially unhinged bioweapon ?   
Allowed to go free .   
Come on , Victoria .   
How do you feel about that ?   
You should know as well as anyone what your sister is capable of .   
One person , who could singlehandedly wipe out Earth Gimel .   
Or , if she so chose , the whole population of an alternate Earth .
”
“ I know as well as
anyone what she ’s capable of
, ” I said .   
I felt too aware of where I was , the amount of air in my lungs , the beat of my heart .   
I felt overwarm for the first time , the stagelamps overhead hot as they shined on me .   
“
I grew up with her .
”
“
You grew up with her
and you parted ways with her .   
You no longer communicate , ” Gary said .
“ I do n’t know why you ’re all so obsessed over her , ” I said .   
My voice sounded too breathy , as I tried to sound casual or dismissive and ended up with a voice that sounded hollow instead .
“
She put you in the hospital- ” John Combs said .
“ We ’ve gone over this .
”
“
-and you needed special facilities , ” he continued .   
“
Because she went to the Birdcage , the Baumann Parahuman Containment Center , and she left you with eight arms , ten hands , three heads with one additional face that had no head or skull to go with it , two-
”
I used my aura , hard , and I was n’t sure it was purely by reflex .   
It was the closest thing I had at hand to slapping him across the face .
In the doing , I hit my team , and from the sounds of it , I hit the audience .
I was keenly aware of the silence that followed .   
Of the noises from the audience that had been affected .   
Lookout
’s eyes were wide behind the mask she wore on her fake , projected face .
Gary spoke , “ That , for the benefit of our audience- ” “ Please be quiet for a second , ” I said , my head lowered a fraction .
“ -was a power use .   
Antares has the ability to project emotions , and she just gave everyone here , including our audience , a moment of abject terror .
”
“
How dare you ?
”
Hamza barked .
“
How dare you ?
”
Capricorn retorted .   
“ Opening up
someone ’s old wounds and getting affronted when they react ?
”
“
How dare you ?
Hamza barked , again .   
He puffed up , chest expanding , and glanced over his shoulder at the staff in the background .
No .   
This was all wrong .   
This was everything I did n’t want to happen .
“ You wanted to get real ?
”
I asked , looking at Lynn .
I was drowned out .   
Hamza was blustering , saying something .   
The audience was getting louder .
Lynn looked right past me as she turned to the camera .   
“
We may have to take a short break .
”
I stood from my seat .   
It was another aggressive power move , like using the aura had been .   
It got attention , and it threatened .   
Swansong stood from her chair too , moving oddly as the projection failed to transition between two poses perfectly .   
From grace to glitch and back to grace .
Capricorn , meanwhile , leaned forward , not quite standing , his hands out , urging the hosts to stay seated .   
The look he gave me was worried .   
Only Gary stood , backing away , almost afraid .
In the background , some people were leaving their seats , filing out through the door .   
Only five or six , but a camera swiveled a hundred and eighty degrees , focusing on their departure .   
Footage for the show , no doubt .
I had the stage , for better or worse .
“
You wanted to get real , Lynn ?
” I asked .
“
That was our intention .   
It sounds threatening when you say it like that .
”
“
That was never my intention .   
It was always my goal to share information , to inform .   
I taught with the Patrol block , I joined this team to teach and counsel , and I wanted- want Breakthrough to be about sharing information and informing , among hero teams .
”
“ Among hero teams ?   
I notice you do n’t mention the civilian heroes , like police , ” Gary said .   
He had n’t sat down again or approached his chair .   
He looked like he could bolt at any moment .   
That nervousness communicated itself to the audience .
“ They ’ve got their hands full , ” I said .   
“ If they want information , I ’ll gladly give it to them , but I ’m not going to put more on their plate just yet .   
Give us a week or three to iron out the wrinkles and get organized .   
That way , any of the issues that come up with any new venture do n’t become their issues .
”
“ How generous of you , ” Gary said .
I did n’t dignify that with an answer .   
I looked at the hosts who were still seated .   
“
Real ?
”
“ It still sounds threatening , ” Lynn said .
“
Do you know where powers come from , Lynn ?
”
John answered , not Lynn .   
“
We know where you say they come from .   
Scion .   
The story about what he is and where he comes from has come up here and there , but it been from people who sound like crackpots , it sounds even more crackpot on its own , and the credible people have been silent .
”
“
Are you saying I ’m not one of the credible people ?
”
“ We ’ll definitely have to look into it and verify with outside sources , to make sure you are n’t giving us a tall tale as a distraction , ” he replied , measuring out his response with a care that would ensure that anyone who could put one and one together would know he was saying ‘ yes’ .
“
The good guys will back it up , ” I said .   
“ Scion is a fragment of something bigger .   
We killed it .   
Its partner- gone .   
Based on what we know , they left a trail that ensures their kind wo n’t be coming after them .   
All we have to do is manage the fallout .   
And that ’s not easy .   
Things they set up are unraveling , that ’s why we ’re getting the broken triggers .
”
“ The disasters , people getting powers and dying immediately ?
” Lynn asked .
“
Taking other people with them , ” Hamza said .
“
Yes .
”
“
And he gave you dangerous impulses , so you are n’t in control of your actions ?
”
Gary asked , his voice dripping with doubt .   
“
You ’re not to blame .
”
“ Scholars have known or theorized about that for a decade .   
It ’s not a secret , and it ’s not a free pass .   
As you guys said , my so - called sister hospitalized me .   
I ’m not forgiving or forgetting , I ’m not giving her a pass .   
A person destroyed me
and I ’m not going to bang my drum and demand they see the inside of a prison .
” My voice was raw with emotion , rancor both for my sister and for the people who were making me talk about her .   
It was n’t the image I wanted to convey , but given a choice between silence and speaking on this , I was going to favor the latter .
“ We ca n’t afford to dwell that heavily on the past .   
I ’m trying to focus on the present moments and on the days ahead .   
We ca n’t make it if we let fear rule us .
”
“ Amen , ” Capricorn said .
“ You make it very easy to fear you , ” Gary said .   
“
You do n’t give us many reasons to trust you .
”
“ You do n’t give us much reason to trust you , ”
Swansong said , barely audible behind me .   
“ If you ca n’t help us , stay out of our way and let us do what we need to .
”
I wanted to correct that , to reject it .
I let it stand .
“
When I asked if you knew where powers came from , I meant on the personal level .   
How did Lookout end up with powers ?   
How did I ?   
You were asking the question when you talked to her parents .
”   
My voice was very level as I spoke .
“
There are theories , ” John said .   
“
The Triumvirate released a book that seemed to confirm the most popular .
”
“
That it took an event , ” I said .
“
Yes .
”
“
Good or bad ?
”
I asked .
“
That was the idea .   
The greatest and strongest came from good events .   
The lowly and the monstrous came from the violent , ugly moments .
”
“ It ’s prettied up , ” I said .   
“
The part about good things giving powers .   
That ’s not true , that ’s the old government trying to keep kids from trying to force it , like your two people in black raincoats that you mentioned earlier .
”
“ They did get powers .
”
“ Long after , ” I said .   
“
You ca n’t make them happen because if you think it ’s a possibility , you are n’t low enough or desperate enough .   
You ca n’t force others to get powers or governments would have whole battalions of people with abilities .
” Had to keep kids from hurting themselves , even if it made it harder to maintain the thrust of my little speech here .
“ You wanted real ?   
There it is .   
Powers and where they come from .   
Millions are watching and millions are on the same page as us .   
Scion ?   
Something set him off , I do n’t know the particulars , but he wanted to wipe us out ,
parahuman and human both .   
We fought like hell
and I lost family members in that fighting .   
He was everything that was wrong with parahumans , and we beat him , and maybe his influence on some of the worst of us has loosened .   
Maybe .
”
“
Nilbog was quiet , almost civilized .   
Bonesaw was helping , with careful monitoring because we ’re not idiots , ” Swansong said .
“
The remaining Endbringers are quiet , ” Capricorn said .
“ We have our problems , ” I said .   
“
We have big issues , really .   
But we ca n’t add the issues of yesterday to them , and we ca n’t …
we ca n’t do this .   
We ca n’t manufacture issues .   
We ’re going to organize , and we ’re going to help each other .
”
“
We ’ll answer other questions , ” Capricorn said .   
“ But not tonight .   
We have things to do .   
We ’re out there .   
We ’re not hard to reach .   
If you ’re news , government , finance , if you ’re a cape and you do n’t know what the heck you ’re doing , reach out .   
We ’ll do what we can .   
Resources allowing , and we ’re getting those resources in place .
”
“
You ’re talking like you ’re done , but we still have half of a show left , ” Lynn said .
Was I ?   
Were we ?
I was .   
We were .
“
You brought up the arm thing , ” Lookout said .   
“
And her hospital stay .   
It was scummy .   
I think we ’re leaving , yeah .
”
She ’d checked with us before the ‘ yeah’ .
Yeah .
We ’d wondered what would happen if they ’d kicked us off the show and tried to take control of the narrative .   
Without planning it among one another , we ’d arrived on the same page about how we ’d handle this .
“
You can talk about Lookout ’s case , Capricorn ’s , and Swansong ’s , or you can dredge up
Mayday ’s history .   
Time and the courts will tell .   
In the meantime , we have work to do .
”
“
The same applies to
Lookout ’s family , ” Gary Nieves said .   
“
They have n’t been tried or convicted by the court .
”
“
We ’ll trust the process , ” I said .
“
So will I , ” Gary said .
We left the hot illumination of the set , into the dimly lit side area , beneath the staring , hostile eyes of the crowd in their seats .
⊙
The mention of the Wretch on national television had felt like the moment the wave had connected .   
It had n’t been .   
That was just for me , my own misshapen boat on uneven , dark waters .
There was always going to be the backlash .   
Hostility , blame .   
Breakthrough being the faces of the enemy , for those who wanted to blame parahumans and make them out to be the people standing between the refugees of Gimel and a better future .
That backlash was always going to be hardest at first .   
The people who watched that show were the people who were receptive to it .   
We ’d left the set -it had n’t been going anywhere good-
and they ’d had another fifteen minutes of discussion and pre - recorded footage before ending prematurely .
The messages were rolling in from online , people finding us and then passing it on to their friends or whatever communities they belonged to .   
There was a lot of vitriol .
“
You can tell yourself that it ’s going to be worse
when it ’s new , the people who are going to back us have to catch on that something ’s going on , catch up , and then find their own voices , ” I said .
“
Yeah , ” Sveta said .
In the time it had taken me to say that , seven messages had come up .   
In the subject lines alone , two had profanity .   
The other five were n’t exactly roses and sparkles , either .
“
But … this is pretty disheartening .
”
“ It is , ” Sveta said .   
“ Speaking from experience
… the best thing you can do is look away .
”
I watched as more messages came in .   
Sixteen in ten seconds .   
That was cheating , though .   
Five were the same guy .   
Subject line : Fuck .   
Subject line : Yourselves .   
Subject line :
With .   
Subject line : A.    Subject line : Rake .
“ I have to wonder at the mechanics of that , ” Rain said .   
He was n’t next to me , but stood by Tristan ’s laptop .   
He was n’t looking at that either , but if he was here in the headquarters at eight o’clock at night , that meant the real him was in his cell , a laptop in front of him .   
He could see the same email feed .
“
You could weaponize it , ” Chris said .
“ I do n’t mind rake man , ” Ashley said .   
“
That ’s a fire that burns hot and for a short time .
”
“
It ’s a fire that burns stupid , ” I said .
I saw her smile .
There were other messages , though .   
One more email came in .   
It was longer , with five times the filesize of even the larger of the others .
In Rain ’s court , a girl had read her letter to him , giving him her forgiveness .   
It had been thoughtful , meaningful , personal , giving and possibly life - altering .   
This email was almost the inverse of that .
A woman had lost her son and she poured grief onto the page like water flowed from a waterfall .   
It was feeling rather than thought , raw , and disconnected from us , our actions , and who we were .   
It was purely and wholly selfish .
Jessica Yamada had once asked me to write letters .   
They had n’t been letters
I was meant to send or give , but
ones that let me figure out the sizes and shapes of some of the individual wounds , so I could work on them .
This was that , but it had been sent .   
The room was quiet and I imagined everyone was either lost in thought or busy reading , taking it in .   
It was long .
A lot of hurt .   
A lot of blame .
“ Just look away ?
”   
Sveta asked .
It was hard .   
It was being stuck on train tracks and seeing the onrushing train , being told not to flinch at the impact or pay too much attention to the train .   
There was nothing we could do about it in this moment , so we were supposed to let it roll us over , damage us .
The same window that gave us a view of the train or of the damage was the window I had to look through to see if there was help coming .   
If it was worth it .
I closed my laptop .
“ I was talking with Fume Hood and the Malfunctions , ” Sveta said .   
“
The Malfunctions started their stakeout and realized they did n’t bring food .   
It was a whole thing .
”
“
They ’re okay ?
”
“ I sent someone their way .
”
“ And Fume Hood ?
”
“
She ’s fine .   
She was with the Malfunctions for a bit , then went her separate way , keeping tabs on someone from our A - list of concerns .   
She ’s been at this for a while , has n’t she ?
”
“
Yeah .   
At least six years , maybe eight .
”
I could see Kenzie ’s computer screens at the front .   
She was talking with Ashley , reading the messages without a glimmer of a smile on her face .   
If anything , she looked energized by Ashley being there , her chatter punctuated by brief statements from our ex - villainess .
Emails with bold text to signify they were unread .   
The labels along the right side of each email were color coded .   
Too many were white .   
Unknowns .   
Anonymous people .
Chris … doing his own thing .   
Too hard to read .   
His stuff was all packed up and he was ready to go back and retire for the night , just as soon as he was sure nothing big was happening .   
Goddess , attacks , riots .
There was a large enough subsection of the population that resented us and enough stirred up by this to spark a riot .
Byron and Rain were the best people to watch , if I wanted to check the reception .   
If I was n’t following the list and immersing myself in that flow of resentment and toxicity , then I could at least watch their faces and see if there was a note of interest anywhere , a spark of hope or light as someone said something in support .
“
Did we make a bad impression ?
”
I asked Sveta .   
“
I thought we looked good on stage .
”
“ You intimidated , ” she said .
“ I tried to cover as best as I could , once my power leaked out .
”
“ Wresting control of the situation .
”
“ Was that wrong ?
”
“
In some of their eyes , you ’re a monster , ” Sveta said .   
“
Anything you do is wrong , somehow .   
For others … it was their show .   
You threw your weight around , took over the discussion .
”
“ If we let them have the control , it was going to end in disaster .
”
“
Oh , for sure , ” she said .   
“
But you took over , and that ’s what they ’re afraid of , I think .   
They ’re upset .
”
I could see the message inboxes on Kenzie ’s screen scrolling as new messages came in .   
White labels .   
No change in Byron or Rain
’s expressions .
“
You ’re right , ” I told Sveta .   
“
I like that perspective .
”
My phone buzzed in my pocket .   
I was still wearing my costume , the breastplate left off , and my phone sat against my belly .   
I was conscious of how alien my skin felt , and how unusual the clothes felt against my skin .    
On a low level , I did n’t feel quite like me .   
It had been a while since that had been the case .
If tonight continued along those lines , that dissonant feeling persisting , I ’d probably need to find an excuse to get out , fly , and hit something .
“
Are you going to answer ?
” Sveta asked .
It was my mom and dad .
I answered , putting the phone to my ear .   
Too much trouble to fish out the earbud and cord from my other pocket .
“
Mom , ” I said .
“ And me , ” my dad said .   
“ Saw you on TV .
”
“
And ?
”   
I closed my eyes , listening to his voice .   
I did miss him , hurt feelings aside .   
It helped to hear a voice I ’d known for all my life when I did n’t feel very me .
“
And people are going to be mad .   
But in our corner , we ’ve talked with this team we ’ve been palling around with .   
Not everyone ’s here , but
… unless a strong voice comes out of nowhere tomorrow morning , you can count us in .   
Any negatives that came up are outweighed by the positives .   
You guys have backgrounds ?   
Unresolved trials ?   
That can be argued down .   
We ’re doing the second chance thing , and people believe you when you say you want to share information and organize .
”
“ They ’re in , ” I said .   
I covered the phone with one hand , felt a twinge of pain in my upper arm where the bullet wound still was n’t one hundred percent .   
“
My mom and dad
’s team are back on board .
”
I saw the eyes of others light up .   
Sveta ’s was among them .
They ’d been a bit down too , awash in the sea of hostility .
“
Yes , we ’re in , ”
my mother was the one who answered .   
“
Good job fighting for what you want .   
It did n’t look easy .
”
“ Thank you .
”
My dad added , “ Knowing your sister , she ’s probably going to take the excuse to reach out .
”
“ It would be generous of you to at least not push her away too quickly , too violently , ” my mother said .
“ Mom .
”
“ Carol , ” my dad said , his tone identical to mine .
“
She was put out in front of millions of people because you chose to step in front of the cameras .   
That ’s all
I ’m saying .   
I hope you ’ll be kind to each other if you happen to end up communicating .
”
I drew in a deep breath .   
“ Thank you for talking to your team for me .
”
“
I suppose that ’s you saying you ’re done with this conversation .   
I ’ll let you go , ” my mom said .
I hung up .
“
A response from Mayday through his intermediary , while you were talking , ” Byron said .   
“
It ’s hard to decipher .   
A tentative yes ?   
He does n’t seem sure .   
It might have been a mix - up in communication .
”
I saw Kenzie do a fist - pump .
“
Better than nothing , ” Rain said .   
“
It ’s movement in the direction we want .
”
I opened my laptop to check .   
For a guy with authority and personality , Mayday ’s response did n’t seem to have much direction , with all of the qualifiers he ’d added .
“
He was in the last episode , ” Sveta said .
“ Of Hard Boil ?   
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
Questioning competency , organization , the PRT , getting into the Echidna event in Brockton Bay , the allegations about the Protectorate .
”
“
Yeah , ” she said .   
“
He ’s sticking his neck out .
”
“ We ’ll pay him back .   
We ’re already drawing off heat , they were n’t done with him , because they left some threads hanging .   
His tie to Kenzie , for example .   
Something for a later episode , maybe , maybe the conclusion episode .   
We ’ll divert attention and deflect from him .   
Over the next couple of days , if any stations want us , we ’ll give them interviews or information .   
Up their ratings
so Hard Boil can sink a bit .
” Sveta nodded .   
“
That ’s time taken away from bigger crises .
”
“
Yes , ” I said .   
“
Absolutely .   
But it ’d be one person at a time , and if we mess with their ratings so soon after they had to end a show early … might knock them down a peg or distract from Mayday .
” Sveta smiled .   
“ Might .
”
“ Might .
”
More messages were rolling in .   
Another team .   
Shorewatch was back , the latest move in their routine approaching and retreating .
And so much anger , so much hate .   
Nine negative messages for every positive , but at least there were positives .
And , so quick I almost missed it , a name flew by , one among three messages that came in all at once .
“ Guys , ” Chris said .   
Fastest on the draw when it came to computers .   
I was still double checking the name .
A name .   
One of the enemy .
Goddess .
“ Shit , ” I heard Sveta mutter .
“ I still do n’t like her title , ” Ashley said , her attention on the screen .
I read the message .   
One word : Meet ?
Shit .   
I set my teeth .
We ’d put ourselves out there , and now we were on her radar .   
Probably .   
The others were agitated , their screens open to the one word message , all of its foreboding .   
The person we were investigating and tracking was reaching out .   
It could have been a threat , an ambush , a ruse .
“ Victoria , ” Sveta said .
I met her eyes .
“
That thing , earlier today ?   
The suspicious thing ?
”
The others were n’t talking anymore .
“
That was Goddess ?
” I asked .   
“
I asked if it was relevant to what we were doing , and you said no .
”
“
It was no , ” Sveta said .   
“
We had other , immediate concerns , and she-
she was n’t one .
” I frowned .
“
Can you bring it up , Kenz ?
” Sveta asked .
“
Are you sure ?
” Kenzie asked .
“ We have to , I think .   
We ca n’t put it off or hide it .   
It ’s going to come up .
”
I could put the pieces together before the image appeared on the screen , and it was still a slap in the face .   
Still an impact that caught me off guard .
A scene , caught through a window .   
Goddess , eating lunch in Earth Gimel .   
Somewhere not too far from where she and her portal were situated .   
If it were that alone , it would have been unremarkable , except maybe remarkable because of the clarity of the shot .
Amy Claire Dallon was in the scene , along with what might have been a pet squirrel , lurking within her sleeve , biting into her sandwich while Goddess sat across from her , holding a sandwich off to the side , her finger stabbing at the table .
I was about to open my mouth to say something , or to ask , but Kenzie seemed to read my mind .
More images .   
Amy , her face covered in freckles from scalp to chin , hair tied back , long sleeves mercifully covering her arms and hands to the knuckles , she was wearing a different outfit .   
Three outfits .
Another image .   
Four outfits .   
That squirrel was n’t a squirrel , whatever the hell it was .
It was good that they ’d kept it from me .   
I would n’t have been able to do anything else and deal with this .   
It was good
they ’d warned me now .
But ‘ good’ on both ends still left a horrible pit in my stomach .








I paced .   
Simple footsteps felt insufficient to burn off the nervous energy , so I took to flying , only to quickly realize that it had the opposite effect-
I would have had to fly at max speed against the wind to feel like the external effort
was helping anything psychologically .
I landed , and instead of pacing back and forth across the room , I used my flight to push myself down .   
Walking a few steps involved a whole - body strain .   
I made it three steps and decided to focus on just standing instead , testing myself against that tension .
It took endurance to keep my knees from buckling or the trunk of my body from folding .   
It took concentration to not automatically snap to using my forcefield , which would absorb the strain with zero effort .
It helped like pacing helped , and it was a little less conspicuous .
The sound of the elevator opening was my cue to stop .   
I was more or less recovered and normal as Dr. Darnall emerged .   
Doctors left the same elevator , one pair that walked together and one alone , apparently doing their rounds .
The hospital itself was inconsistently lit .   
Areas were dim , where patients were asleep , and other areas were bright .   
It was almost backwards , that there was so much lighting where there were no or very few people , and the places where the people were most densely congregated were dimly lit and quiet .   
The white walls and bright fluorescent lighting made the difference from the dark , unlit pre - sunrise morning outside that much more intense , like there was nothing at all beyond the hospital .   
Rain droplets on the window captured the light at an angle , forming crescents .
Darnall was dressed down from the prior times
I ’d seen him , wearing a sweatshirt over a t - shirt , jeans , and nice shoes .   
He looked as tired as fuck , with lines in his face .
“
Good morning , Victoria , ” he greeted me .   
He did n’t sound tired , at least .   
“ Thank you for coming out here .   
It makes things easier .
”
“
It ’s not a problem , ” I said .   
“ Thank you for seeing me with no notice .
”
“
You ’re welcome , I ’m happy to address whatever it is this is .   
Here , this way .   
We can talk in the cafeteria .
”
The building was the same hospital where I had visited Fume Hood , and the same one where I had done some rounds of crisis - point style visits , flying kids around .   
The part that had been under construction weeks ago was built , and other parts were now in progress .   
The hospital was set up with long - term care in mind , and the surrounding area was arranged to give the families of patients the ability to stay or live close to their loved ones .
Some of those people were up at this alien hour , in this fluorescent white space .   
In a lunch room that could have fed two hundred , three or four pairs or groups of people sat talking .   
There was a wide expanse of open seats and benches where the only person who might approach and overhear was a janitor .
“
Do you have someone staying here ?
” I asked .   
“ Is that too personal a question ?
”
“
No .   
But I come here for some of my other patients .
”
“
Ah .
”
“
This is close to home , and it ’s reasonably close to you , you said ?
” he asked .   
When I nodded , he nodded as well .   
“
I do n’t go to restaurants , so I do n’t know what places we could meet at .   
With most of my patients , they have places they prefer , or I ’m going to them because they work high - pressure schedules .   
Much as you do .   
If you prefer anything different-
”
“
This is good , ” I said .   
“ Just- anything except an office or actual hospital room .
”
“
Good .   
If it ’s alright , I ’m going to grab a coffee .
”
“ I ’ll grab something too ,
” I said .
It was kind of awkward to follow him through checkout and either make small talk or be silent , so I took a bit more time than necessary .
We sat .   
The table was slightly damp , having been recently wiped down , and I used my jacket sleeve to wipe it dry before pulling the jacket off and draping it over my lap .   
I wore a sweater - knit tube top over a button - up collared shirt- the fabric of the shirt was too thin on its own , because ninety percent of the shirts on the racks were , and the sweater part of it at least kept things modest while dressing things up in a similar - ish way to wearing a vest .   
Jeans worn with the legs pulled down over boots kept things more casual .
“
I ’m sorry to have you wake up early ,
” I said .
“
It ’s not too bad , today .   
It being this dark out makes it feel later than it is-
I had a year where I had three patients I saw at five in the morning , because it was the only way to fit around their shifts .   
Six - forty - five is nothing compared to that .   
Is this an emergency , or something between an emergency and a regular appointment ?
”
I had to think on that for a second before deciding .   
“
The second one .
”
“ I had that feeling .   
Is it okay if we structure this like an ordinary session ?
” I shrugged .   
“
Sure .
”
“
Okay .   
We ’ve met for two sessions now , laying groundwork- ”
His polite way of saying we had n’t made much progress .
“
-and as part of that groundwork , we set out goals and tasks for the week .   
It has n’t been a full week , but I ’m interested to hear how this is going .
”
“ Uh , two components to the homework .   
Tracking my mood over the course of the past few days , and tracking my outbursts .
”
“
Let ’s start with the first .   
Mood ?
”
“
It ’s … nervous right now .   
Over this week … I wrote it down as a morning , noon , night thing .   
There were days I was busy
and I did n’t get to it until the evening , and it was really , really hard to remember how I felt earlier that day .
”
“ Even when you thought about the events of the day ?
”
“
There were days where I was contacting hero groups , trying to get people on the same page , going after the same villain pair twice … and at the end of those days I could n’t remember if things had happened that day or the day before , or sometimes the day before that .
”
“ I wonder if there ’s a way to stabilize that , or structure things better .
”
“ I do n’t know , ” I said .   
I had an iced tea with peach flavor in front of me , and I cracked it open .   
I took a sip and then said , “ Not at this stage .
”
“
Alright .   
Were you able to work it out ?   
If there were blank spaces in the entries , I would be concerned that they would be the times you would most want to be aware of your state of mind .
”
“ When I ’m most stressed and busy ?   
Yeah .   
I used my phone , the music I listened to and the text messages I sent .   
I was … surprised .   
Having a focus helped .
”
“ Reaching out to the other groups ?
”
“ And Lookout .   
Yeah .   
Except , I think I was surprised by the positive trend , and I let my guard down .   
It led to outbursts .
”
“
Uncontrolled power use ?   
On television ?
”
“
That was the big one ,
yeah ,
” I said .
“
How ’s your diet ?
” “
Skipping meals .   
Eating stuff like this on the fly .
”   
I indicated my blueberry muffin .   
I picked off a crispy edge , dismantling the cap .
“
Your sleep ?
”
“ I was up late and I ’m up early , as you can see .   
That ’s pretty usual .
”
“
Are you functional ?   
Having difficulties focusing ?
”
“
No .   
But I think my body tricks me sometimes .   
Fatigue sneaks up on me .
”
“ If you ’re fine after staying up late and waking up early , then do n’t worry too much about it .   
But be mindful and take notes , try to track fatigue and times when you feel you ’ve hit your limits , at the same times you ’re tracking your feelings .   
It can sneak up on you .
”
“
Okay .   
I ’m not sure it ’s staying up late , exactly .   
Last night , it was because a teammate was attacked .   
Casualty from appearing on television is that the bit - rate villains will break ranks and try to mess with you .
”
“
Was that Lookout ?
” Darnall asked .   
When I nodded , he said , “ Is she okay ?
”
“
She ’s more or less fine , but she ’s having to relocate from her home to an institution .   
Anyway .   
We ’re still trying to track down the people who did it , but that cuts into time I ’d spend sleeping .
”
“
It ’s good to be aware of that .   
Continue to keep track of those times when you do slip , either outbursts or disassociation , and do try to eat better .   
Your body needs its fuel .
”
Dr. Darnall sounded a lot like my mom , talking about the fuel of the body .
He told me , “ See if the days of accidental or impulsive power use or especially bad disconnects from whatever is going on correlate to days you ’re not sleeping enough or times you have n’t eaten recently .   
I do want to talk about that involuntary power use in a minute .
”
“ So do I. ”
“
It ’s a good first update .   
I like how you ’re already assessing your own data from tracking your emotional state .
”
“
That ’s the plan , right ?   
Training me to be my own therapist .
”
“
Yes .   
That ’s a good quick assessment of the homework .   
If you ’re up for it , I ’d like to keep our appointment for the one - week mark , you can keep taking notes and keeping track , and we ’ll focus on it more then , with some deeper discussion .
”
“
Sure .   
No complaints .
”
“ Any questions before we move on ?   
Thoughts from your last session ?
”
“ No questions .   
No thoughts .
”
“
Okay .   
Then let ’s talk about today .   
Why did you call ?
”
“
Well , ” I said .   
I removed my jacket from my lap , moving it onto the bench beside me , just so I could shift position to something more comfortable .   
“ One of the most powerful and dangerous people on Earth wants to meet to talk .   
She was a villain and tyrant who took over a whole Earth .
”
“ You said you were nervous .   
She ’s why ?
”
“
She has apparently recruited my sister , ”
I answered him .
Even just saying it , it was taking the respect I ’d accumulated for this very powerful , very scary woman and tainting it .   
It took a big feeling and made it also one of the most negative feelings possible .
“
Someone toxic who was gone from your life is now back .
”
“
Somewhere nearby .   
We may end up talking .   
Um .   
But the timing is godawful .
”
“
It absolutely is .
”
“
Some b - list nutjobs just came after a kid .   
That would never fly , before Gold Morning .   
They put our lawyer in the hospital .   
We have n’t caught up with them yet , despite me spending a few hours last night on the hunt , but the consensus seems to be that it ’s stupid , petty people seeing us putting our faces out there and wanting to ride the wave of attention .   
I had a kind - of aunt who died for pretty similar feeling reasons , and remembering that ’s really bothering me .   
And then my sister gets thrown into the mix ?   
She ’s the one thing I ca n’t handle .   
I ca n’t deal with thinking about her on a good day .   
Now I have to face her on a bad one ?
”
“ Do you have to face her ?   
What happens if you sit this one out ?
”
“
I do n’t think anyone truly knows her .   
Sveta knows her by association only .   
If I sit this out , I think this ends in utter disaster .
”
“ You attended the taping of Hard Boil .   
You lost control of your power and it almost ended in disaster .   
Why is this different ?   
What guarantees that your intervention and presence makes this better ?
”
I drew in a deep breath .
“
You look like you disagree .
”
“ I do n’t blame you for taking that stance , when it comes to the show .   
It ’s an interpretation , and a fair one .
”
“
For what it ’s worth , it did n’t end in disaster .   
I ’m still rooting for your team .
”
“
Thank you , ” I said .   
“
That means a lot .   
Look , Hard Boil was always going to be a disaster or something approximating one , ” I said .   
“
I do n’t think the show changed many minds among Hard Boil ’s core audienece .   
It did distract and let us pass the ball to people who can take the shot , and opened up the way for those who receive the shots .
”
“
I ’m not sure I understand .
”
“
Okay .   
Look , Mayday ’s with Advance Guard .   
The team was pretty fractured after the attack on the Fallen .   
This morning he ’s going to go on television and radio .   
People have questions about powers , about Scion , the day we fought Scion .   
They ’ll have other questions and the teams we ’re associating with are positioned to talk about it .   
We ’re coordinating this like we planned to coordinate information .   
People want to know this stuff
and they want to discuss it .   
Hard Boil wants to demonize Lookout ?   
They ’re going to be left behind while everyone else focuses on bigger things .
”
I saw his eyebrows go up .
“
It ’s an excuse to let people reach out to media and put their best faces forward .   
We sacrifice ourselves a bit to give everyone else a chance to elevate themselves .   
Considering the problem came out of our camp to start with
, it ’s a kind of amends .
”
“ One that came back on you .   
Not to diminish what you ’re doing , but you talked about wanting to protect Lookout , and she was almost hurt , by your own words .
”
“ It did .   
You could argue that once they chose to use Lookout as their example criminal for the show , she was going to be a target anyway .   
We just did n’t think they would track her down that easily , or that they ’d be willing to cross that line .
”
“ I hope you ’ll forgive my saying so , Victoria , but there seems to be a common thread running through your statements and behavior here .   
You seem to be fighting with all your might to get control over the situations you find yourself in .   
You talked about wanting to get a handle on the situation with the people who attacked your teammate in her home .   
You ’re sacrificing sleep to hunt people down , and you stood up on stage and took an aggressive stance to regain the control you ’d lost .   
Then you left to keep it .
”
“
Well , I mean , obviously .
”
“
Explain this to me .
”
“
The Fallen ?   
Chaos and ignorance .   
The community center attack ?   
Shortsightedness , more chaos with civilians caught in the fray .   
Hollow Point ?   
Chaos and greed .   
The invading soldiers from Cheit ?   
Secrecy and ignorance .   
We combat the chaos with order and the ignorance with the sharing of information .   
We combat greed by being selfless .
”
“
No mention of your sister and this Goddess ?
”
“ I do n’t … really think of my sister , if I can help it .
”
“ Sorry .   
But you did ask me here to discuss her , did n’t you ?
” I hesitated , then nodded , finding it momentarily too difficult to talk .   
I drank some of my peach iced tea .
I tried to think of my sister as an agent of chaos .   
Maybe way back then .   
Goddess ?   
She would cause chaos , as soon as she decided to make a move .   
But was she an embodiment of it ?
If I ’d thought she was one , I would n’t have been willing to consider the meeting .
Doctor Wayne Darnall was n’t talking .   
Waiting for me to finish sipping at my iced tea and round out my thought .
“ I do n’t know how to deal with her , and I worry I ’m not strong enough to deal with Goddess .   
I want help .   
I need … whatever armor you can give me , psychologically .   
I need tools or weapons , coping strategies , any mental tricks you have for not snapping .
”
“
It does n’t work that way , Victoria .   
My goal and my role is to equip you with tools that you learn to use over the long term .   
The operative word is learn .   
Nothing is instantaneous .
”
I ’d known that .   
I just … a part of me had hoped he could give me some tricks .   
Even for the placebo effect , just to give me a sense that I was n’t completely defenseless while facing down giants like my sister and her new queen .
“
Sorry , ” I said .   
“ For wasting your time .
”
“
It ’s not a waste .   
I do n’t think there are any one - hundred percent answers , but I do think we can take some baby steps in the right direction .   
We can talk coping strategies , coping mechanisms , but only if you understand these are n’t fixes , and I ’m not giving you the all - clear .
”
“ Please , ” I said .
“
For the record , I do n’t think you should attend this meeting if your sister might be present .   
There ’s too little to gain , and too much to lose .
”
“
I ’m the reason she wants the meeting .   
Amy ’s the reason that ’s the case .   
If I do n’t facilitate this and attend , then there is no meeting , there is no communication , and there ’s only chaos .   
I do n’t think the good guys come out ahead in that scenario .
”
“
All for the sake of getting a handle on this ?
”
“ One hundred percent
, ” I answered him , with only a sick feeling in my gut .
“
Then let ’s change the subject for a moment .   
I may have been misreading things as I watched the episode , correct me if I ’m wrong , but your team looked surprised when the subject was raised .   
My instincts were that it was n’t because of how low the hosts stooped in trying to get to you .
”
“
It was n’t .   
You ’re right .
”
“
Have you told them since ?
” I shook my head .   
“
Only one of them .
”
“
I ca n’t armor you , Victoria , but I can point out a weak point you ’ve been ignoring .   
Let ’s talk this through .
”
⊙ I felt conspicuous , as people milled around me .   
The hospital was waking up , and both the families who were staying at places nearby and the families who were really devoted were arriving for the start of visiting hours .   
Eight thirty in the morning .
I did n’t feel great , as it happened .   
I was less Victoria Dallon and more the arms , legs , body and head of Victoria Dallon , very aware of the clothes she wore and the movements of this body .   
With the rain outside , people came in with wet hair , umbrellas and coats .   
Slick wetness slid across bare hands and occasionally the face .   
Lurching bodies periodically bumped and brushed up against the body of Victoria Dallon .
I hated this
and I did n’t fight it either .
It was a state of mind that had kept me alive and sane when the body had n’t been mine .   
A way of framing thoughts and not letting the small discomforts and the awkwardness get to me .   
In rehearsing conversations and facing the details I ’d have to spell out for others , I found myself back there .   
Not irrevocably so , I could have backed off or forced myself to the surface , but I was n’t one hundred percent up to it .
Some people saw me and gave me second glances .   
One or two smiled .   
Ten glared or gave me dirty looks .   
The looks only distorted the alignments and fits of body , skin , mind , and heart .   
I could rationalize it-
I ’d been on television less than twenty - four hours ago , after all .   
I could n’t sell that rationalization to the feeling in my gut .
It went beyond just me , though .   
It felt like people were more frazzled , more angry , more rumpled .   
My mind was in a place where I was more able to dwell on the bad .
Natalie had family with her- a few young cousins or siblings , a few people of an age to be aunts and uncles , and a lone parent : a mom who was probably the complete inverse of my mom .   
Her mom babied her , getting water that she did n’t reach for , fretting , moving aimlessly .   
The main reason I thought the kids were Natalie ’s siblings was that her mom looked very much like a mother of four that had n’t slept , showered , and had pulled on whatever she ’d had at hand .   
Natalie just seemed to lie back on the hospital bed and let it happen , making regular comments to the cousin or sibling nearest to her in age .
A rain - slick umbrella licked its way along the length of my arm .   
I pulled my arm away , gripping my wrist to help keep it out of the way , and took a step forward and a step the side .   
Toward the door , putting myself in line of sight .   
I rapped my knuckles on the frame .
“
Oh , hi Victoria , ” Natalie said .   
To her family , she said , “ This is someone I ’m working with .   
You ’re up early .
”
That got me a dubious look from her mom .
“ I was in the area .
”   Intentionally .   
“
How are you ?
”
“ I ’m ready to go home .   
They kept me overnight after I fainted a second time , and I really should n’t have .   
I ’m discharged after lunch .
”
“
I ’m still worried , ” her mom fretted .
“
I ’m just really , really lame .
”   
Natalie ’s head lolled back to her pillow as she said it , as if she was exasperated .
“
You ’re not lame , ” I said .   
“
You went above and beyond last night .
”
“ That night feels like a dream now , ” she said .   
“
The pain drugs are contributing to that feeling .
”
“
I ’m
sorry
we put you in the line of fire , ” I said .   
“
That kind of thing with going after people at home- that should n’t happen .   
It ’s unprecedented .
”
“
Do n’t say that , ” Natalie said , mock - stern .   
“
As the closest thing you have to legal counsel , you saying that is tantamount to admitting culpability .   
If I wanted to sue you , you ’d be digging your own grave with that .
”
“
Right , ” I said .
“
This was n’t what I wanted for you , ” her mom cut in .   
“ You would have been safer going into medical school .
”
“ If I worked in a hospital , I ’d have belligerent drug - seeking patients to deal with or something , and I ’d be miserable .   
I ’m working under some excellent lawyers and my prospects are good .   
I ’m only three - quarters miserable doing what I ’m doing .   
If I put up with the three - quarters I do n’t like for a little while longer , I ’ll be able to move to doing things I like .   
And I get to do this stuff with the hero team too .   
Scary moments aside , it ’s really neat .
”
“ The hero team is too dangerous for what you ’re getting .
”
“ You do n’t even know how much I ’m getting .
”
“
I know it ’s too dangerous !
”
“
Thank you for coming , Victoria , you do n’t have to feel obligated to stay for the family squabbling .   
Can you keep me updated ?   
I may drop by at four or five .
”
“ You should rest , ” her mom protested .
“ I can do that , ” I said .   
“
I ’m glad you ’re on the mend .
”
“ They warned me I ’ll have a scar , but they said I ’ll probably have no permanent damage .
”
There was no sentence the mom did n’t react to , whether it was dramatic expressions , eyes widening , or posture shifts .
“
Can I see ?
”
She had to adjust the hospital gown collar , pulling it down enough to show me the slash .   
From sternum to shoulder , and some of the arm .   
Only the arm had bandage taped over it – by the location , it might have nicked an artery .   
The rest had the stitches alone .   
It was even on both sides , stitches neat , skin not puckered or even that inflamed for this stage in the healing process .
“ Looks tidy .   
If you want , I brought a pack of different shades of camouflage concealer over from the old Earth , and I think I have one that would match your skin tone .   
You ’re a shade lighter than me .
”
“ You do n’t have to do that .
”
“
It ’s only enough in each tin for two or three applications , but maybe you ’d want it for an event .   
Minimize or downplay the scar while wearing something strapless .
”
“
Thank you , ” she said .   
“
I do n’t think I ’ll wear anything strapless in my life , but it would be really nice to have the option .
”
“
Also brought this , ” I said .   
I held up a knit blanket , still in its packaging .   
It was tartan , in bottle - glass green , white , and dark gray .
“
Thank you , ” she said .   
I saw the worry line on her forehead , even as she smiled .
“
The last time I visited this hospital , there were walls still incomplete .   
I was imagining a draft .
”
“
It ’s perfect .   
Can you put it over my feet ?
”
The mom took it from me and arranged it over Natalie ’s feet .
Natalie seemed inordinately pleased with the gift .   
Meanwhile , I felt weirdly out of place in my own skin , and very aware of her family ’s attention on me .
“ Drink , Nat , ” her mother urged .   
Natalie drank her water .
“
If you ’re bored with nobody around , and if visiting hours are still open , there ’s something I want to discuss , ” I said .   
“
I can bring anything you need , too .   
I ’m fast
and you ’re not far .
”
“ If you think my mom is leaving while visiting hours are open , you ’re just plain wrong , ” Natalie said .
“
Where is that doctor ?
”
her mom asked .
“
Do n’t bother the doctor , mom .   
Everything ’s fine .
”
“ The more attention you get , the better .
”
“ I will get worse care if I ’m obnoxious .
”
“ I ’ll be the obnoxious one then if it means getting you the care you need .
”
“ Natalie , I ’m going to get out of your hair , ” I told her .   
Then , spur of the moment , I winked and said , “ Be sure to get in touch about that one - on - one conversation .   
Team stuff .
”
“ Team stuff ?   
Legal ?
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
But it can wait until this afternoon , I think .
” That was excuse enough for Natalie to shoo her mom and the mini - Natalies out of the room-
they were n’t even paying attention to us , mostly sitting in a row of three chairs in the corner , talking .   
They went with the aunts and uncles .   
Cousins .   
The mom went a separate direction .
“ Needed a moment to breathe ?
” I asked .
“
Yes .   
Thank you .
”
“
Believe me , I get it .
”
“
My mom is embarrassing .   
I love her , but you ca n’t tell her anything .   
Your mom , I know for a fact , is awesome .
”
I drew in a breath and held back the big sigh I wanted to give .
“
Are you okay ?
” Natalie asked .   
“
You did n’t stay up all night hunting those losers from Kenzie ’s house , did you ?
”
“
No .   
We got the mooks and handed them off to the authorities .   
Tipped off other teams , we ’re collapsing on them like we did with Trial and Error .   
If we pin them down , I might fly over and help .
”
“
Are you okay though ?
”
“ I did want to talk with you about something one - on - one , ”
I told her .   
“
If you ’re up for it .
”
“
Something legal ?
”
I shook my head .   
“
Not really .   
But it came up last night , and it ’s been pointed out to me that this stuff being kept private is kind of a weak point .   
Maybe if the others had known , they would have known what to say when it came up on the show .   
Extra heads-
“ -extra arms , ” I finished .   
My voice was quieter with each word .
“
That was a real thing ?
”
Natalie asked , equally quiet .
“
I was a puddle of body parts for two years and the one person who could change me back sent herself to the one place nobody was supposed to get out from .   
She threatened bioplagues if they did n’t send her there …
”
“
Bioplagues ?
”
“
So I heard .   
She said if they put her in a jail cell , she ’d make bacteria that ate through whatever materials they made it out of , and disperse the bioweapons through the holes .   
It was stupid and shortsighted to send her to the Birdcage , but she forced their hands … and now she ’s working with Goddess .
”
Lips , a tongue , and a throat that did n’t feel quite like my own carried on with their explanations for our unofficial eighth member of Breakthrough .
⊙ Sveta ’s first words on seeing me were , “ You ’re drenched !
”
“ Saw Natalie , ” I said , stepping inside .   
Most of the team was assembled in the headquarters .   
No , it looked like it was everyone .   
Chris was just napping under a table , waking up as Byron kicked the table leg .   
“
She seems alright , all things considered .
”
“
That ’s so good to hear , ” Sveta said .   
Without moving from the center of the room , she snatched up a towel from a table and thrust it into my chest .   
I grunted at the impact .
“
I ’m glad , ” Ashley said .   
Her projection was beside Kenzie .   
It was static , like a power - saving mode , arms folded , legs crossed , rear end against the edge of the desk , but nothing below the neck moved .   
“
We owe her one .   
Does she need books or something while she ’s in the hospital ?
”
“
She ’d be out of the hospital before she could finish anything .   
Is there any news on our targets ?
” I found myself looking to Tristan for the answer , but it was Byron sitting next to Rain in that corner , instead .
“
No reports from the teams that are helping us out , ” Rain said .
“ Nothing on Goddess , she ’s sleeping in , ” Kenzie said .   
“
But we did have some weirdness at the prison earlier .   
I was n’t here , and I could n’t do much on my phone , but it ’s like I kicked a sad , pathetic hornet ’s nest .
”
“ Hornet ’s nest ?
” I asked .
“
An enclave of really shitty tinkers , ” Chris said .
“
Probably teacher , ” Rain clarified .   
“
But we were thinking it might be the Speedrunner cluster .   
The New Fallen .
”
“ Whoever it is , it ’s fun !   
It ’s like playing whack - a - mole , except they ’re bad at dodging and the guts get everywhere when you land a good hit .   
Really satisfying .
”
“
But you do n’t have the files you wanted , ” Chris said .
“ I ’ll get them soon !
”
“
This is your specialty and they ’re succeeding in stalling you .
”
“ I ’ll get them soon , Chris !
”
The flow was comforting , reassuring .   
Stuff to do , enemies to target .   
The banter , the easy companionship .   
More a team than friends , maybe , or that was the immediate vibe .
“ I need to get this out of the way , ” I cut in , abrupt .   
I was aware of the heads turning .   
That ease and comfort fled , replaced with scrutiny .   
Only Sveta looked concerned , not suspicious or surprised .   
“ Therapist ’s orders .
”
“ Is this- ?
” Sveta asked .
I nodded .
“ If I do n’t do this now , I wo n’t get around to it .   
It was a problem last night .   
I do n’t want it to be a problem again .   
It ’s too glaring a weak point , and if my sister ’s out there , it might come up .   
You need to know what she ’s capable of .
”
“
She changed you , ” Chris said .
So blunt , so crass .   
I was annoyed and that annoyance
could ’ve made it so very easy for me to take all of the feelings that were stewing inside and lash out at him .
I glanced at Sveta .
“
It ’s more than that , Chris , ” Sveta said .
“
Easier to show than tell , ” I said .   
I indicated the door .
It took them time to get outside .   
Raincoats , an umbrella .   
It took more time because Rain and Ashley were locked into position for whatever reason .   
Kenzie left last , one camera under each arm , while Byron held up one umbrella .   
Sveta just let the rain soak her .
When they ’d all found the fire escape , I was by the ground .   
I walked by the trash , and snatched up three two - by - fours .   
Planks too warped for use in construction or repair , weather - worn from being left beneath the fire escape .
I took to the air , holding out the two - by - fours .   
I let the Wretch out .
Hands took the two - by - fours from me , holding them out and ready .   
One creaked with the hold on it .   
The other twisted as two different hands gripped it and threatened to snap it .
My hands no longer held the beams of wood , while they floated near me .
And as the rain came down , droplets ran down and wicked off , momentarily tracing the Wretch in its entirety .   
The arms , the heads , the faces , the hair .   
A tangled flowing of nude flesh , parts repeated over and over again , with me in the center of the mass .   
I did n’t look at it , keeping my head down , my hood down where it covered most of my face .
“
She can do this , ” my voice did n’t sound like me .   
“ Change powers by changing the host ’s physiology .   
She made the Class - S threat that took control of everyone , bringing them to the battlefield .   
That ’s who ’s going to be at the meeting today . ”








I cast off the Wretch as I reached the fire escape .   
Water did n’t stick to my forcefield , and a lot of it wicked off naturally , but there were enough crevices and folds that did hold water that the rainwater came down all at once .   
It splattered against my hood and back , and against the slats of the fire escape .
The others retreated as I landed , some folding up umbrellas .   
I knew it was to give me room to land , and to get back to where it was dry-
no reason to stay in the wet outdoors .   
I was aware , I knew the rationale , and I could n’t shake the idea that they were getting out of the way of the Wretch .
I was no stranger to distorted thinking .   
Even before … before everything , I ’d been swept up in it .   
As a child , wanting to belong to my family , being the odd one out , until I got my power .   
I ’d later realized how lonely powers were .
The flip side of the coin applied too .   
Being the odd one in .
Amy had been the odd one in more than I had .   
Purely average in appearance , quiet , she had n’t been passionate about hobbies or about anything in particular .   
She ’d liked movies from Aleph and when she was twelve she ’d break her usual reserved , quiet composure to get way too excited if she checked the change slot of a vending machine or pay phone and found a quarter .   
And yet when we got to high school , she was automatically included in the group of popular students .   
The group with Dean , who was supposed to take over his dad ’s company , and with the star athletes and the star athletes’ boyfriends and girlfriends .
I ’d eventually looked beyond my bubble of thinking my sister was great because she was my sister
and I fucking
loved her , wondering why she was included in the group of popular students when she was n’t popular .   
Then I ’d had to draw the eventual , inevitable conclusion , and wonder if I belonged to that group .   
Was I there just because my parents wore costumes and had flashy powers ?
I ’d settled in despite that .   
Amy had settled out- hanging out to keep me company , but not going out of her way to stick with the group .   
It had been easy for her to move in that direction , after I ’d gotten powers .   
I ’d been grateful for my earlier realization about the nature of the group , because it kept me real and provided a starting point for realizing where Dean was coming from , having come from money .   
I ’d loathed it at the same time , because it cast doubt on every normal interaction .
My perspective had been distorted by anger , by the fact that I ’d been young and I was being confronted with some of the uglier sides of my town .   
A classmate had confided in me that she had trouble seeing her path to a happy future because every adult she knew seemed miserable , and I ’d sat back , thinking that I could n’t see a way for our whole city to have a happy future because my parents , aunt , and uncles had sacrificed nearly everything and there were still racists , addicts , murders , theft , corruption , and pain .
It had been around the point of that realization that I ’d started hitting harder , as if I could hit the worst offenders hard enough that they would stay down .   
Living up to the ‘ brute’ part of the brute classification .   
So stupid , deluded , short sighted .   
Even now , I shuddered to think what I might have become if the combination of Dean and my sister had n’t reined me in .   
In that world of heroes and criminals , that very stark reality , I had n’t had enough points of reference to think straight .
The truth did n’t always correct distorted
perspectives-
it could just as easily create them .   
Comforting lies and illusions were important .
The group maintained its retreat , my instincts told me it was because of what I ’d shown them , while my brain continued to protest in vain , telling me Kenzie was waging a war with a ‘ hornet ’s nest’ and the others were putting umbrellas away and getting situated .
I did n’t miss the fact that Byron switched to Tristan , even though it was n’t
Tristan ’s turn .
It was Sveta who approached .   
She still had the towel she ’d tried to give me .
“
Let ’s try this again .   
Get yourself dry , ” she told me .   
“
Whatever you need , let me know .   
I ’ve got you .
”
I put my hand over hers , and gave it a waggle .   
Then I took the towel and dried my face of the moisture that had beaded it in the midst of stormy weather .   
Lengths of my hair had been blown free and been soaked , and I wrapped the towel around each in turn , squeezing the fabric to leech out the moisture .   
I did n’t look at anyone in particular , and in a way I was spared from having to , since Sveta was close .   
She was wet , damp , but she loved the water .
I was on the third length of hair , which had wrapped around my shoulder , when I heard someone break the silence .
“
That shape-
that ’s what you looked like in the hospital ?   
Your sister changed your power ?
”
Kenzie .   
Wide eyed , innocent .
“
How about I tell you after , Kenzie ?
” Sveta asked .   
“
I know most of it .   
If that ’s okay , Victoria ?
”
“ Thanks , ” I said .   
I was worried about the silence , and I decided to confront it head - on .   
“
I needed to get that out of the way .   
It ’s hard to bring up or even explain .   
My forcefield is wild .   
It ’s important that if we get into a fight , you have some sense of its reach .   
I pay close attention , but stuff happens .   
If I end up compromised … something which is n’t out of the question with people like Goddess in play , it ’s important you know .
” I saw some nods .   
Kenzie looked very serious .   
Tristan too .   
Chris looked disinterested .
“
The forcefield is your strength ?   
It ’s the car - crushing strong part of your power ?
”
Rain asked .   
“
It ’s hard to ask questions , because I do n’t want to push , but I just want to make sure , get this out of the way .
”
“
Yeah .   
It ’s where my strength comes from .
”
“
It ’s good to know , ” Tristan said .   
“
Fuck those guys on television for getting into that .   
They knew ?
”
“
Seems like , ” I said .
“ That might be important , ” Tristan said .   
“
It felt like they were angling to come after me , too .   
They had sources .
”
“ Including whoever tipped them off about Kenzie ’s parents , ” Ashley said .   
“
I ca n’t imagine them watching that show or reaching out to those people first .
”
“ Gary Nieves first , probably , ” Tristan said .   
“
He was supposed to be on point .   
We threw him by getting onto the show and changing the topic of conversation to Gold Morning .
”
“
That ’s not really a clue , ” Rain said .
“ It might be important .
”
Tristan ’s voice was firm , his response almost an interruption .
“ It might be , but … okay ?   
If the trail leads to Gary , are we going to confront him or expect him to have a casual talk with us ?
”
“
No , ” Sveta said .   
“
He ’s a bigot .
”
“
Right , ” Rain said .   
“
So let ’s not get too stuck in that specific mud .   
We ca n’t use that info , so let ’s just keep in mind that people are getting info and using it to sling that mud at us , and move on .
”
“
At Mayday too , ” Kenzie said .   
“
He was the focus of episode one .   
It was why he was distracted when we were trying to coordinate everyone .
”
Tristan sighed audibly .
“
There are a lot of things to focus on , ”
Rain addressed Tristan .   
“
Let ’s focus on what we can fix .
”
“ I like that , ” Sveta said .
Tristan met my eyes .   
I nodded .
Distorted perspectives aside , I did have the impression that Tristan had jumped in to change the subject , and that it had worked .   
Based on my understanding of him , it seemed like his particular form of goodwill .   
Ashley was a staunch defender of her favored few , with thorny words for anyone who stood against those few .   
Sveta supported .   
Tristan …
he hurled himself into the fray .
“
On the topic of immediate threats , any updates on Hookline and Kitchen Sink ?
” I asked .
“
Herded to where we have surveillance teams waiting , surrounded and arrested .   
Auzure got the actual arrests , actually .   
They ’re sitting in on the interrogation , and they ’ll send us info when they have it .
” I winced .   
Not my favorite team , but …
it was good
we got them .
“
There was chatter , ” Kenzie said , her back to us as she typed .   
“ Love Lost was n’t happy they did that , apparently .   
She might be covering her rear .
”
“
It fits her , to not want people going after kids , ” Rain said .
“
Okay , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Also , I do n’t know if this matters , but they noticed what we did when we went after Trial and Error , and people mentioned it in phone calls and whatever when Auzure got Hook and Sink .
”
“ Online too ,
” Chris added .   
“
People mentioned it in some villain sub - forums .   
They are n’t doing anything about it yet .   
Emails are still coming in about your stunt on the show , mostly negative .
”
“ Our stunt on the show , ” Ashley said .
“
Sure , ” Chris said .   
“
Still , randoms came after us once , and they might do it again , if the emails we ’re getting are right .
”
Tristan shook his head .   
“
Another one of those things we ca n’t do anything about .   
The question is , was it worth it ? ”
“ The other hero teams are getting a chance to shape the discourse ?
” I asked .
“ Mayday put on a good show , a bit stilted , ” Tristan said .   
“
Some ex - Wardens were also out there .   
Chevalier ’s back , Legend and Valkyrie are away doing something important .   
Narwhal does n’t do TV , and some of the ex - Guild like Stonewall and more stern , dark Protectorate types like Cinereal are n’t exactly TV types either .
”
“
Weld ’s pretty good at it , but he ’s still away , ” Sveta said .
Crystal too .
It was sobering , that we had so much going on , and key figures and faces were gone .   
People close to us .
“
But they ’re doing okay ?
” I asked .   
“
I was busy all morning
, I ’m behind on things .
”
“
In my expert opinion , they ’re doing
okay ,
” Tristan said .
“
It ’s looking like it might have been worth it , ” Sveta added , her voice soft .   
“ Time will tell , but for now it looks like we ’re mostly on course .
”
I really hoped that was true .
“ About
your morning- ” Tristan started .
I caught the uncharacteristic hesitation , and I heard the change in tone .   
More serious .   
Was I wrong that he was changing the topic ?   
Were we going back to it ?
“
You decided you needed to share stuff you ’ve been keeping in your back pocket , ” he said .
I nodded .
“
It ’s good for us to know
in case it comes up in conversation .   
It ’s good if we know how we each operate on the battlefield .   
I ’ll match you , I ’ve been stuck on something the past week …
”
His power .
“ …
My and Byron ’s power are in flux .
”
“
What does that mean ?
” I asked .   
“ Changing to a different creation ?
”
“
Nothing that extreme .   
Hopefully we do n’t go that way .   
It ’s just that right now ,
I ’m stronger , Byron is weaker .   
Which might be to our advantage .
”
“ You ’re stronger ?
” I asked .
“
Right now ?   
Yeah .
”
He created a swirl of orange motes .   
They manifested into a rough cleaver shape , the edge narrow if not quite razor sharp .   
Dark stone with veins of orange - red running through it .
“
May I ?
” I asked .
“
It ’s heavy .
”
I crossed the room , and I took the oversized cleaver .   
Dense .
“
Can I destroy it ?
”
“
Sure , ” he said .
I flew up a bit , so the floor was n’t in the way of the Wretch .   
My forcefield out , I let the Wretch grip it , my focus fixed on the cleaver , looking for a sudden jerky movement that might indicate the Wretch was flinging it at someone .
The narrowest edge cracked , then cracked more , but it took three or four seconds before it outright broke , a corner coming off .   
Once that happened , the entire thing broke into chunks , raining down to the floor .   
I let the Wretch go , and the stone dust that had built up in crevices fell down in narrow streams .
“
During the Trial and Error fight , your creations were n’t this strong .   
They were practically chalk .   
Weak , no substance .
”
“
Yeah , ” he said .   
“ In flux .   
Sometimes it ’s more stable .   
Lately ?   
It ’s very back and forth .
”
“ Powers do that , ” I said .   
“
Some more than others .   
Breakers especially , some Trumps , and powers with a lot of random chance .   
They depend more on the alien intelligence to manage the power , or they ’re closer to that intelligence , so those parahumans feel it more .   
Powers are more generous or leave you hanging .
”
“ You think the random chance side of things is n’t random ?
”
Rain asked .
“ I find myself wondering , ” I said .   
“
But I think if we ’re dwelling on the sources of powers , it might be worth keeping in mind that it serves their purposes .   
They have wants , and it makes more sense that when they ’re choosing something random or giving us more or less raw power , they ’ll favor us if we ’re meeting those wants .
”
“ After I killed Snag , I got an edge , power - wise .
”   
Rain ’s expression shifted at the admission , brows drawing together .
“ I had good and bad days when it came to my misfires , before I had working hands , ” Ashley added .
“
Not technically you , ” Chris pointed out .
“
Me enough .
” Chris shrugged .   
“ Meh .   
I do n’t think this conversation is fair to some of us , for the record .
”
“ Making sure everyone knows what ’s up with each other ’s powers ?
” Tristan asked .
“
Pressuring side members of the group to divulge by being all share - happy .
”
“ If you think there ’s happy in this sharing , you ’ve got it wrong , ” Rain said .
“ I think there are agendas , ” Chris answered , his tone harsher , his eyes moving between people but fixing on me more than anyone .   
“
Maybe not the first thing in anyone
’s mind , but I think it ’s a thing in people ’s minds .
”
“ Chris , ” Sveta said .   
“
There ’s no agenda .   
If you wanted to share , then we ’d be happy to get more information , but for right now- ” “ You do n’t have to tell us anything , but if you wanted to tell us stuff
we ’d like it ?
”
Chris ’s tone was sarcastic , almost mocking .
Distorted perspectives .   
The day had barely started and I felt wrung - out .   
Now he was attacking my friend ?   
It was enough to piss me off in a shockingly short span of time .   
No rising temperature leading to a boil –
it was one sentence in one voice that had me instantly off .
“
You ’re being ridiculous , ” Tristan said .
“
All I ’m saying is that it seems kind of manipulative , the power - players in the group dish out their personal dirt , team mom Sveta plays nice and tries to rug - sweep- ” “ Do n’t call me the team mom , ” Sveta said .
And it was at times like this that I could n’t afford to act on feeling .   
Fingers and fingernails digging into the fabric of the towel
, I kept the idea of the warrior monk in my mind .
“
Why do n’t we pause this conversation and come back to it with cooler heads ?
” I asked .   
“
I know I ’d be happier if we could .
”
“ Why do n’t we just drop it entirely ?   
You said what you needed to say , fine , whatever .   
But it does n’t need to be a conversation .   
If it ’s a conversation then that means it ’s going somewhere .   
And that somewhere is just more pressure and expectations that we talk about shit .
”
“
You were the one who told me this team idea worked because we trust each other , ” Ashley said .
“ I think it ’s painfully ironic that you take something I shared with you in a private conversation and bring it up to make a point about trusting one another .   
Or do you want to get into that full conversation and why I brought that up ?
”
“ Ease up , Chris , ” Kenzie said .
“ Stop .
”   
I used more emphasis and volume .
“
That-
” Chris started .
Tristan banged his hand on the table , hard .   
There was silence in the seconds after , broken not by words , but by the mechanical shuffling of Sveta ’s body as she walked over to Kenzie ’s workstation .
“
You ’re way out of line , Chris .   
This is n’t what we ’re about , ” Tristan said .   
“
Did you dose on double - strength paranoia recently ?
”
“
Why do n’t you ask one of the girls if they ’re acting aggressive because they ’re premenstrual ?   
It ’s about as sensitive .
”
“ Stop , ” I ordered .   
I had to resist using my aura to punctuate the statement and get their attention .   
“
Enough .   
Whatever you ’ve got going on , deal with it , or ask for help if you ca n’t deal on your own .   
But do n’t do this .
”
“
May I go for a hike , ma’am ?
”
All sarcasm .
“
It sounds like a good idea .   
Let ’s clear our heads before we return to this topic .
” I did n’t miss the change in his expression , like he was about to say something .   
Before he could , I said , “ If we return to it .
”
Clearly pissed , inexplicable in mindset , he gathered his things .   
His messenger bag had a flap over the top , protecting it from the rain .   
Grabbing an umbrella , he headed for the door .   
Out into the late - morning darkness and the torrential wet .   
The wind that stirred in the room saw others standing back or catching papers before they could blow away and scatter .   
The cool wind made me very aware of my soaked clothes .
“ If you ’re heading somewhere , call me .
”
I patted at the damper spots with the towel .
“
What the hell , Chris ?
”
Rain asked .
With no apparent powers in the mix , Chris’ paranoia had somehow disconcerted the team more than me revealing the Wretch .   
No warped perspective at play
there-
I understood it .   
A destructive , invisible force with an alien or dark subconscious driving it was n’t a threat to the team or the dynamic in the same way that a problematic thirteen year old was .
Kenzie offered her interpretation .   
“
Chris gets to a bad place now and again , and he does n’t have anyone because he does n’t want anyone .
”
“
That ’s not an excuse , ” Tristan said .
“
No , ” Kenzie said .   
“
But I think he ’s great
, he ’s so fun when he ’s cool , and I think he deserves a chance to work through whatever
’s bothering him .
” Tristan sighed .   
“
This was n’t okay , here .   
Right ?   
I ’m not out of my mind ?
”
“
It was n’t okay , ” Sveta said .   
“
But we ’re all going to have one bad day , sooner or later .   
Days our powers screw us up , the past catches up to us , or life kicks us while we ’re down
and we ca n’t explain it to the group .
”
“ Do we need to go after him ?
” I asked .   
“ Is that an invasion ?
”
“ Leave him be , ” Sveta said .
“ We need to figure out how we ’re going to handle the meeting with the Lady in Blue , ” Tristan said .   
He drew in a deep breath and heaved out a sigh .   
“
You ’re up for this , Vic ?
”
“ I have to be .
” ⊙ Eight out of ten of our computers and phones were refurbished salvage .   
Old tech polished off with new software and new logos .   
The new software included an emergency alert system , each phone and computer now with a warning front and center , or a warning in the top corner , the image depicting water droplets with snowflakes embedded in them , rows of icicles in the background to fill in the white space .
Because our phones and systems throughout the region were being leveraged to get the warning out there , all services were slow .   
The alert was obnoxiously persistent , popping up with every one degree change in predicted temperature .   
Not a good thing when we needed battle updates .
The Major Malfunctions , Fume Hood and one other cape in their area were responding to reports of suspicious activity near a power facility as a group .   
A thinker on my mom and dad
’s team was aware of potential riots stirring- or , more specifically , being stirred up , and the active members of that team were responding to that , ready to stave off any problems before they occurred .   
The Patrol was out and patrolling , no training for serious events , because today was the serious event , just a bunch of painted school buses and young people in scavenged body armor trying to control the damage done .
And those were just the groups and organizations I was personally managing .   
Tristan had his set , Sveta had hers , and Ashley had a couple of people she was emailing .
It was the first truly cold weather since spring ; freezing rain that coated every surface in a thin sheet of ice .   
Ice left people outright spooked .   
Spooked people , in turn , did desperate things .   
They banded together to attack even larger groups and institutions , and they robbed places to try and scrounge up resources that could help them get through the winter .   
Even with the average Janes and Joes who were leaving work at four in the afternoon , there would be countless accidents , people needing saving .
I would have liked to be out there , helping .
I would have really , really liked it if they had focused on staying warm and stayed indoors .   
Instead , this weather was a cover for the covert ,
the break in the city ’s rhythm a chance for the criminal , and it was a whole lot of activity needing attention .
The cameras showed Goddess walking up stone stairs .   
The stairs were built into a hill , not far from the apartments where laborers had been situated .   
All around the peak of the hill , construction projects stood dark , still unfinished following the strike a month ago , the same event where a broken trigger had leveled a crowd and broken the backs of a laborer ’s union .
She had an entourage of two .   
Three if I counted the creature huddled in Amy ’s jacket .   
Goddess’ jacket was blue , with a white fur ruff , and she had black pants on , with boots worn over .   
The coverage did n’t seem exceedingly necessary , as she was n’t touched by the rain .   
That rain came at an intensity that made it closer to darts being flung sideways than any water coming from above .
She was her own eye of the storm , and the storm was n’t hers .   
Sundancer had briefly stayed in my hometown , and her burning orb had n’t touched anything within a few feet of her , but it had been hers , under her express will .   
This storm was just nature , and where the rain bent away from her and ran along an invisible slope , I could see the distortions in the air .
A young man with brown skin and an umbrella that did n’t seem to budge in the wind walked beside her , the umbrella open despite the lack of necessity .
On the other side was a young woman with brown hair , freckles dense on her face , neck and arms , and tattoos visible on the backs of her hands , poking out of voluminous coat sleeves .   
A white duffel coat , with red toggles .
The others kept glancing at me , double checking me , making sure I was   
okay .
“
The Attendant had a member who got hurt , ” Capricorn reported ,
in Tristan ’s
natural confidence .   
“ Mission fail .
”
“
Damn , ” I said .   
“
Can we follow it up ?
”
“ Everyone is tied up or resting .   
Nothing available , no .   
It was n’t a big mission either .
”
“ They still failed , ” Swansong said .
The laborers had built these stairs to make getting from one side of the hills to the other easier .   
The path was a touch convoluted , but it was better than hiking up steeper slopes .   
At the halfway mark , a gazebo - style enclosure or lookout had been set up , with benches inside and out , plexiglass windows , and a fire pit in the center .
Buckets of sand and shovels were sitting at the ready beneath tables and in cabinets that had been built into benches .   
At that fire pit , a fire burned , keeping its flames down as the wind seeped between plexiglass and stone column .
My heart was pounding .
We were all , Cryptid included , assembled .   
We ’d established a ‘ v’ formation .   
Capricorn was at the front , me at his right shoulder , Swansong at his left .   
Beyond Swansong was Rain , while Sveta was by me .   
Past Rain was Chris , while Sveta kept Kenzie close by .
She walked with audible , powerful footsteps that should n’t have echoed like they did , given the environment .   
I could hear her .   
And I could her the scuff of shoe on stone .   
I knew those footsteps –
she ’d never picked her feet up enough when she walked places .
It became hard to breathe as they stepped into he enclosure .   
This was it .   
We ’d taken precautions and we were making use of safety measures , but the wait was over .
“ I would say thank you for coming , but what ’s the use ?
” the Lady in Blue asked .   
She reached out in the direction of the fire , and it swelled in size .
It was an oddly disconnected fragment .   
The formality so brief I had to replay the question twice in my head , the question not directed at anyone in particular .
“
We ’re here and we ’re open to talk , ” Capricorn said .   
“
We ’re a novice group but have information and we have connections .   
Are introductions in order ?
”
“ Bianca , ” the Lady in Blue said .   
“
This is Luis , and I hope you know who she is .   
I already know your names .
”
“
Hi , ” was the addendum from-
I could n’t call her my sister because that familiarity combined with relative proximity upset me on a deeper level .   
I could n’t call her Amy for much the same reason .   
From Amelia .   
I felt my skin crawl .   
“
And this is Dot .
” I had to look to see , getting my first really good look at the little squirrel - like companion .   
Big ears with longer hair drawing to a point at the tips , a long prehensile tail with a tuft at the end , and big eyes .
“
Should we call you Amy , Amelia , or Panacea ?
” I asked .
“ Amy , please .   
Same as always .
”
“
And are you actually creating life from- from nothing ?
”
“
No .   
She ’s her own being .   
It ’s really good to see you .   
It ’s nice to meet you ,
Breakthrough .   
Tress , I ’ve heard a lot about you , secondhand .   
Swansong , we meet again .   
Same , Cryptid , kind of .
”
I ’d known she and Swansong had crossed paths .   
She had checked Bonesaw ’s work on Amy ’s hands .   
Cryptid , though ?
I swallowed and the swallowing made my throat hurt , it was so tight .
“ Bianca , ” Capricorn said .   
“
What can we do for you ?   
I ’m guessing you saw us on television , and you decided to open discussions .
”
Bianca did n’t reply right away .
“
A power was taken from me , ” Bianca said .   
“
Without it , I ca n’t return to my throne .   
I ’m being hunted and fucking hounded , and I get no peace .
”
“
We ’ve been keeping an eye on you , ” Capricorn said .   
“
We did n’t see any assassination attempts .
”
“ Not lately .   
They ’re active elsewhere , which freed me up enough to meet with Amy and her father .
”
As she ’d said ‘ elsewhere’ , she had turned her head .   
Indicating the portals ?
“ Flashbang or Marquis ?
” I asked .
“ Marquis , ” Amy replied .
Her voice got to me more than anything .   
Hesitant , quiet , perpetually apologetic .   
I did n’t want apologies .   
I just wanted to feel normal .
“
An ally , ” Bianca said .   
“ I like people with their rules .   
Discipline .   
It ’s a good mindset to have .
”
“ Including Monokeros ?
” Swansong asked .
Bianca pressed two fingers to her lips , kissing the knuckles halfway down .
“
That does n’t tell me anything , ” Swansong said .
“
Silence is golden , ” Amy translated .
Gold is a loaded word .   
Idioms or gestures from strange earths might work better than running away with this .
Gold .   
The tattoos on Amy ’s hands had traces of gold .   
More black , more red .
“ If you ’ll help me get what you need , I ’ll help you with our mutual enemies and I will reward you .   
Help me take power , and I have a world ’s worth of wealth and resources .   
I can make you head of a state .   
I can give you power and influence here .   
I can tell you that people in my world were very interested in deciphering powers .   
They helped make me what I am , unwittingly , but they were happy in the end .   
The , ah , monsters who made you , painted Tress , that icon on your cheek- ” Sveta reached up , touching her cheek .   
I was caught between observing her and paying attention to the gestures that punctuated certain words .   
Monsters , index finger curled into a hook .   
By the faint change in her expression , perhaps something obscene .
“ -they would deposit the monsters and the unsolvable riddles in my world .   
We solved most .   
My understanding of powers helps , our labs help more .
”
“ I could help too , ” Amy said .
My heart sank into my ankles , plunging through and leaving cold toxicity in its wake , curling through my midsection .
“ All our heart ’s desires , and we just have to bow and scrape for the rest of our lives ?
” Swansong asked .
“ I ’ll give you a heart ’s desire each , if you ’ll find this person with my power .   
You have the means , the knowledge , and the talent .   
No servitude required .   
I would go home and conquer it fairly , again .
”
“ I ’d go with her , ” Amy said .   
I winced a little at the sound of her voice .   
“
I would be gone forever , if you wanted .   
Like I tried to do ,
way back then , except I ’ve been thinking about this a lot , the last few weeks .
”
I knew just what arguments had struck home for which people .   
I worried some had been tailored to specific individuals .
But there was no way we could conscience handing her power or agreeing to this , when it meant potentially putting an entire Earth into servitude .   
We ’d say no ,
and-
“
We ’ll think about it , ” Capricorn said .   
“
We need a bit of time to discuss .
”
“ Minutes ?   
Hours ?
”
“ A day ?
” Capricorn asked .   
He glanced at us .   
“
At a minimum ?
”
“
Time is of the essence .   
In a day , things might be too far gone .   
Your Mama Mathers , Rain , is gone .   
They ’ll find out soon .   
Your Valefor is healed and gone .   
Warlords from your old Earth have been snatched up , and people do n’t yet know .
”
“ Half a day , ” Capricorn said .   
“
Maybe .   
It’s- ” “ Amy , ” Bianca said , and her voice was low .
“
I say yes .   
Play fair with them , give them their time , agree to some of my dad ’s stipulations for your next term of rule , I ’ll come with you , be your lieutenant .
”
I heard a whisper .
“ And Dot too .
”
“
It ’s easier and cleaner to gather my army .   
Let the hounds come en fucking masse .   
One fell stroke .
”
I had a sense of her way of speaking now , as it belatedly clicked .   
Like a girl from an overly formal private school or college , bucking at the confines .   
Spoiled and dangerous .
“
That ’s not clean at all , ” I said , as diplomatically as I could .
“ If we run out of time , if we let them get too much of an upper hand , it will be the opposite of clean .   
Ask your Amy .
”
“
It ’s bad , Victoria .
”
“ Don’t- ” I said .   
“
Do n’t say my name , do n’t address me , thanks .
”
“ Okay .
”
“
It ’s bad .   
Alright , ” I said .   
“
But there are options .   
Better ones .
”
“ If you attack the prison , you ’ll be playing right into their hands , ” Capricorn said .   
“
They ’re ready for you .   
It ’s how we ended up here in the first place .
”
“
I ’ll recruit my assistance , and I wo n’t be attacking alone , ” Bianca said .   
Then there was a moment , and it was like she ’d said a word with monumental emphasis .
My heart skipped a beat .
Sixty - four miles away , we were still in the headquarters .   
Cameras and projectors put images of us in the gazebo - like structure .   
But she ’d known that , she ’d realized it right away , and been put off by it .
Sixty - four miles away , and she had me , without an action or a word spoken .
I looked at Sveta , ready to communicate something , and I saw it in her eyes .
She had us .   
All of us .
“ I took over a world with my power , ” Goddess said .
“
Bianca-
” Amy said .
Goddess half - turned , hand raised .   
Amy went silent .








“ Bianca .   
This was n’t what I agreed to , ” Amy stated , a tightness in her voice .
“ I told you the damn stakes .
”
“
No , Bianca , ” Amy said , firmer .   
I watched the projected image on the wall , and saw the little creature crawl out of the space between duffel coat and body , perching on Amy ’s shoulder .   
She held what looked like a razor blade melted into the plastic end of a pen , but the nib of the pen was a spike-
the resolution and angle were n’t good enough for me to see .   
“
This is n’t okay .   
This is not how you win me over .
”
I blinked a few times , my thoughts turning over .
“
Amy , ” Goddess said .   
“
I like you .   
I like your father-
”
“
Then do n’t mess with my family .
”
“
-But I ca n’t make concessions to win you over if I lose everything else .   
You know the stakes , you know the situation , and if you want to change my mind , you ’d better stop posturing and start thinking of some good fucking arguments or options .   
I have no patience right now .
”
“
Okay , ” Amy spoke with measured words , “ I would appreciate it if you would free them to think coherently so they can also come up with arguments and options .
”
“ They ’re clearheaded .   
Or they will be .
”
“ They ’re stunned .
” Were we ?   
I did n’t feel like I had my mental footing , after the realization of what Goddess had done .   
I did n’t feel especially bothered by the realization either , but I could n’t find a train of thought that went anywhere and that did bother me .   
It was n’t that they were stalling or being derailed , but that it was a complete and total paradigm shift to switch over to thinking of something that would work for both Breakthrough and Goddess .   
My eyes darted over the room and looking at anything , everything , in my effort to find inspiration .   
Everything except the image of Amy on the wall .
“ Give them a moment .   
Once they ’re with us , this discussion will move more smoothly , ” Goddess said .   
She sounded calmer than before .
“ I- ” Amy started .
“
It ’s fine , ” I said , authoritative .   
If I ’d had my aura , I might even have used it for punctuation , for all the good it would do against Amy .   
I did n’t want to let her respond if it meant I had to hear her voice .   
“
Let ’s do what we need to do , you can leave for some world where you get to be a queen , and I never have to see you again .
”
“ That’s- ”
Amy started .   
She winced .   
“
That ’s a gut punch , Vicky .   
For what it ’s worth-
”
“
It ’s not worth anything .
”
“
She was going to come after you all anyway .   
I convinced her to talk to you and your team- ”
“
We talked , ” Goddess said .
“
-but you did n’t talk enough before doing this .   
Please believe me , Victoria , I did n’t want this .
”
A refrain that I ’d heard before , that played through my nightmares .   
I shook my head , as if that could cast off words or whatever else .   
“ Just stop , please .   
Stop talking .   
Leave , get lost .   
Please , you owe me that much , ”   
I talked over her ,
too impatient and angry    It was worse because I was experiencing a moment
’s hesitation , a lurching feeling like I stood on a cliff ’s edge
and I was unable to fly .
“ I do , but-
there ’s no point where I ’ve done enough to make up for it ?   
I ’m not sure what I ’m supposed to do .
”
Did she mean to let bygones be    bygones , as if that was even possible ?   
Was I misunderstanding ?   
‘ Done enough to make up for it?’
“ I mean , I ’m doing more harm if I let this happen , ” she said , as if to clarify , her voice quiet .   
She sounded lost , a little hollowed out .
I tried to ignore her , my skin crawling .   
She sounded lost , hollowed out , and she communicated that same sensation or experience to me with her voice .   
It was n’t an unfamiliar voice , either .   
I heard voices like that around the edges of my nightmares , images and scenes my brain could n’t keep in my long - term memory .
There were other things to dwell on .   
Goddess , for one .   
This feeling- I could place the why of it .   
I ’d made assumptions .   
I addressed Goddess .   
“
I said we ’d part ways after this was done .   
Was I right about that , or is the plan that we come with you after ?
”
Goddess answered me , “ I ’ll end my relationship with Breakthrough after I have what I need from the prison , a few of our mutual enemies’ underlings removed , then you can decide with clear heads if you want to come with me .   
Agreeable ?
”
“
No , it ’s not agreeable to me , ” Amy said .
“
It ’s perfect .   
Stop talking , Amy , ” I said .
“
Victoria-
”
“ Stop !
”
I raised my voice , taking a step forward .   
It took Capricorn
’s hand on my shoulder to remind me that she was more than sixty miles away .
I ’d spooked Lookout by being so loud , by the looks of it .
I saw Amy drop her hands from the small raised ‘ hands up’ position that had followed my shout .   
It would have been comical if just about anything about this scene had been different .
I did n’t like feeling so off when it came to my mental footing , especially when I had to deal with the relative proximity of someone
I ’d really hoped I ’d never have to see again .   
I avoided looking at the screen-
I did n’t want to make eye contact , to see if she was staring at me .
“ Make her stop talking , I ’ll stop , you can talk to the team , ” I said .
“ Breakthrough ?
”
Goddess asked .
The others were voicing their agreement- most of the others .   
My thoughts were chaotic enough that I was momentarily incapable of sifting through overlapping voices .
“ … should work out , ”
Capricorn ’s voice trailed after the others .
Even the projections of Swansong and Precipice nodded assent .   
Good .   
The satisfaction that we were all on the same page was disrupted by the sound of her voice .   
Amy ’s voice .   
I grit my teeth .
“ Vicky , ” Amy said .   
“
I ’m on your side here …
and I do n’t think you ’re on your own side .
”
“
Are you working against me now ?
”
Goddess asked .
“
No , ” Amy said .   
“
Because I think this is a bad move .   
I ’m helping you by saying no to this .
”
“ You do n’t get it , ” I said , and my voice went weak on ‘ get’ in a way that made me think it would crack .   
I did n’t want to be weak .   
I wanted to be angry , so I spoke with more fervor , more harshness in my voice .   
“
The fact that you ’re here , that you wanted to talk to me , it shows you do n’t get it .   
You invade my thoughts every few minutes .   
You altered me as a person , on multiple levels .   
Everything I do now , everything I touch , everything I eat , it ’s stained with- with you .   
You intruded that deeply , that thoroughly , and the very fact you think you can talk to me is screwed up .   
It ’s another intrusion , your words in my ears .   
Whatever you think you ’re doing-
this is n’t helping .
”
“ After this is done with , I think you ’d thank me .
”
Heavy words .   
I was pretty sure she ’d said the same thing way back then .
Something in my expression seemed to communicate that .
Her expression was forlorn , lost .   
Fuck her .   
She asked , “ What am I supposed to do ?   
If I let this happen then you ’re never going to forgive me .
”
“ I was never , ever going to forgive you in the first place , even before this meeting , ” I spat out the words , and the pent up emotions found some release in those words , anger etching the sounds more and more .   
I was aware of my team in my peripheral vision , and my voice softened a bit .   
The Warrior Monk .   
What would Jessica want ?   
I did n’t have an answer ,
so I asked a question instead , with no anger in my voice .   
Only the disappointment equivalent to an entire childhood of friendship , loyalty , trust and respect being dashed to the rocks , infusing quiet words as much as anger had infused the loud .   
“
How do you not get that ?
”
She did n’t have a response to that .   
Her creature looked between her devastated expression and ‘ me’- the projected image of me .
“
I could ask you to , ” Goddess told me .   
“ Forgive her .
”
“
No , ” Amy said , as I shook my head .
The standing - on - a - ledge feeling lurched inside of me at the idea .
Goddess reached out to fix a lock of brown hair that the rain had pressed down to Amy ’s ear .   
I moved my shoulders , shifting my weight on my feet-
I wanted to squirm free of skin and awareness to not be a part of this .
Goddess asked , “ What am I going to do with you , Amy ?
”
I stared at Lookout ’s workstations , at the other monitors , the email feeds , desperate for something that would give me an excuse to not be here , a distraction or a daydream .
“
It might be better if I handle things from here on out , ” Capricorn murmured in my ear .
“
Yeah .   
A lot better , ” I murmured back .   
“ Thank you .
”
Goddess was talking to Amy in the meantime .   
I did n’t want to listen , but she was n’t the kind of person who was ignored .
“
… asked you what you wanted , you said you wanted to talk to her .    
You wanted resolution before you left .   
That was part of the deal .
”
“
I meant-
I did n’t say to force her .
” I winced .
I heard Goddess talking to Amy , telling her ,
“
You did n’t say it , but you wanted it .   
Needed it , even .   
Now you have it .
”
There was only silence .   
I imagined a head - shake , but I did n’t want to look .
A damning silence , I thought .
Something about
Amy ’s voice with an edge of desperation to it hit me to my core .   
Silence was better .
“
We ’ll return to that if we have time .   
Breakthrough , ”
Goddess said .   
“
Let
’s talk strategy .
”
There was a moment
’s hesitation before Capricorn responded .   
“
Let ’s .   
What do you need ?
”
That hesitation was a factor- especially if the hounds were coming calling .   
I knew Capricorn ’s own thoughts
were no doubt working on getting used to the new paradigm .   
There were wrong answers and right answers , and nothing was explicitly saying we could n’t choose the wrong answers , but … why choose the wrong answer ?
“
The last time I made a play , there was a twenty minute delay before they came .   
This time , my danger sense suggests something closer to ten or twelve .
”
“
Good to know , ” Precipice said .
“
What does it mean ?
” Capricorn asked .   
“
When the hounds come ?
”
“ They ’ll come for me , at first .   
Lesser tinkers and thinkers with guns , grenades , more tricks than sheer power .   
I do n’t get the feeling
he ’s willing to go for outright war .   
Squads are led by people with enhanced coordination and special means of communication .   
They strike in coordination , multiple squads with perfect timing between them .   
I can fend them off , but not forever , not without my full complement of powers .   
If I use my full powers , it draws hostile attention of other sorts .   
Your Wardens , or what ’s left of them .   
Others .   
If I run , I have to abandon my missions , they gain ground , and they will divine who I was working on and target them .
”

This is Teacher ?
” I asked .
“
It is .
”
We ’d heard some of what was going on from Tattletale .   
To hear about Teacher having this kind of clout was a little daunting , bringing home some of Tattletale ’s anxieties .
Forget Goddess having a small influence over us- the notion that I was both facing down Amy and sympathizing with Tattletale threatened to break my brain in half .
No .   
This was n’t okay .   
The wrongness of the situation crept through my bones and belly .   
If I ’d had to talk more or ask follow - up questions , I felt like I ’d be stuck for what to say .
“ You had a camera person ?
”
Goddess asked .   
“
It came up on the television program .
”
“
Me , ” Lookout said .
“
And you ’ve networked with other groups ?
”
“
Yes , ” Capricorn said .
“ Connect me to those groups .   
I want straight video feed , or multiple groups gathered in one place .   
Internet is unreliable and phones are frequently down .   
What can you do in ten minutes ?
”
“ I have connections already , ” Lookout said .   
Eager to please , happy to have been proactive .   
“
Secure line , separate and distinct from what the city has .   
It does n’t connect directly to most of those guys , but I can leapfrog from a place very close to them .   
I can do it in a minute , as fast as I can dial the numbers .
”
No hesitation curve there , I noted .
“ I ’ll come to you .   
Be ready .
”
“
No , ” Cryptid said .   
His voice nearly overlapped with Amy ’s .
“ Why not ?
”
“ It does n’t make sense .   
We should be compartmentalizing more .
”
“
Compartmentalizing like having thirty - two online accounts ?
” Rain asked .
“ Like that .   
Break operations into cells .   
You want to do something , Goddess ?   
Fine .   
Hold off your small army and let us do what you need us to do .
”
“
Just you ?   
No .   
I want others .
”
“ If you reach out to others , people are going to realize .   
Thinkers watch out for this kind of thing .   
Some teams have their precogs , others are scattered and wary .   
We ’ve told them to be careful , because multiple players in this game have stranger or master powers .
”
“ Cryptid is the paranoid type , ” Capricorn explained .
“ If you ’re not super paranoid then you ’re not paying enough attention to how fucked up things can be , ” Cryptid said .   
“
There are people still trapped in time looped torture bubbles .   
The kid who did it ?   
He was supposed to be dead .   
There is no degree of ass - covering that ’s too much .   
This ?
You ca n’t show your hand .
”
Amy had been murmuring with her creature- to Dot , she ’d called it .   
Trying to work out a course of action .   
She ’d paused to observe this part of the conversation , and that she was observing that keenly was something worth paying attention to , as much as I did n’t want to .
“ I ’m not convinced , ” Goddess said .   
“
There ’s no time for subtlety .
” Cryptid explained , “ They put the prison behind two portals .   
They have the means to close ways between universes-
they used it to seal off Aleph entirely .   
That ’s the trap .   
If you go there , they abandon ship and lock you in , or they ’ll just blow up the prisoners that might end up compromised .
”
“
Let ’s avoid that , ” Precipice said .
“ They ’ll try to evacuate staff , they have ways to get them out fast , but they will lock them in if they have to .   
If you try to take over teams and word gets out , they ’ll take similar measures , blow up anyone who might be compromised , or they ’ll lock off the prison , temporarily or permanently .
”
“ We could shut off communication , ”
Lookout said .   
“ Keep them from sending out an alert .
”
“
Sure .   
Except are you sure that would n’t set off failsafes ?
”
“
Uhh .
”
“ I think it might set off failsafes , ” Cryptid said .
“
Things were rushed , ” I said .   
“
They ca n’t get universities up and running , groups are underfunded , we ’re just getting a working government .   
And you think they ’ve built a perfect prison ?
”
“ I think the stakes are high , ” Cryptid replied .   
“
Swansong probably wants to keep her legs .   
Precipice too , though he could probably do a prosthetic arm for a leg .   
And I ’m betting our Lady in Blue does n’t want the other guy to win .   
Screwing up would hand him that win .   
We can be better than that .
”
“
A good - enough prison , maybe ?
” I asked .
“
Let ’s anticipate everything , ” he said .
“
It ’s hard to imagine you were being so unreasonable a few hours ago , and you ’re Mr. Rational now .
”
“ I was reasonable and rational all along , ” Cryptid retorted .   
To the screen , to Goddess , he said , “ I ’m confident I ’m right here .   
This is n’t the way to do this .   
There are too many traps .
”
Goddess did n’t respond .   
The silence stretched .
Cryptid was staring at the screen , chin up , headphones and headgear on , but masked with the projection plate that dressed up his body in weird shapes and shades .   
I could see his silhouette , slightly broken up , but I could n’t see much of him .
Between Rain and Capricorn , Swansong was staring off into space .   
Was it a consequence of being on the other side of a computer screen , two steps removed ?   
No-
because Precipice was more or less normal .
She was fighting this- treading water .   
The inverse of Lookout .
Amy approached Goddess , and she spoke in a very low voice , inaudible .
Lookout glanced over her shoulder at us , then typed something out .
The audio distorted , then settled at a point it was audible .   
Nobody complained-
I suspected because they all wanted to know .
Even my desire to know outweighed how little I wanted to hear Amy talk .
“ -to do things better this time .   
You wanted people who were n’t yes men .   
I ’m trying to be that , but I ’m not good at it .   
I ’m not a debater , I ’m not quick .   
Cryptid ’s team has information we do n’t , and he says no .
”
“ We can hear you , ” Cryptid said .
“ Chri - ptid !
”
Lookout hissed .
“ So do n’t go talking about anything private , ” he added .
“
Is he trustworthy ?
”
Goddess asked Amy .
“
No , ” Cryptid said .   
“
No
I ’m not .
”
“
He ’s reliable , ” Amy said .
“ Cryptid .   
You ’ll come to me by the fastest means possible .   
Head to Bridgeport , the downtown crossroads , wait five minutes , then head East from there .   
Stop at landmarks .   
I will find you .
”
Goddess said .   
“
We ’ll compartmentalize , as you said .   
Individual cells .   
You ’ll come with me and coordinate .   
Breakthrough ?   
Work on the prison problem .   
I will be in touch .   
Acceptable ?
”
“ If I ’m understanding the way this works , you could tell me to level the entire city , and I ’d think it was acceptable , ” Capricorn said .   
There was something in his voice that made me think he was smiling beneath his helmet .
It felt disconnected , weird .   
The storm still raged outside , there was virtually no light out there , and the lights inside seemed artificially bright .   
It was like we were in a box , and the world beyond was n’t real .   
This was just a story , a contained , ethereal scene .
A nightmare in a box .
“
No , ” Goddess said , approaching Capricorn ’s projection .   
She studied it- a head and face that perfectly matched
our Capricorn ’s in position and in every last detail .   
“
You ’re not capable .   
By asking if it was acceptable , I wanted to know if there were questions or concerns .
”
“ You ’ll be in touch , ” Capricorn said .   
“
We ’ll ask then .
”
“
Then we ’ll go , there ’s not much time before the asshole
’s mind - slaves are after us , ” she told Amy , Dot , and Luis .   
“
I ’ll be in touch , Breakthrough .   
Next time , we meet in person .
”
I glanced at the screen just in time to see Amy glancing back .   
Momentary eye contact I had n’t wanted .   
She flipped up the hood of the white coat , with its red cross at the brow .   
I watched her go , her squirrel - gremlin climbing up to her shoulder , to wave its toothbrush - razor in what might have been a wave or might have been menacing .   
She put a hand up to catch it , pulling it down to the front of her coat , where she rummaged , presumably getting it settled there .
I did n’t know how to digest it all .   
I had fear in my chest , anger running through me and a pit of something bleak in my gut .   
I felt like I could burst into tears
and I felt like I was too numb to move , let alone cry .
I suspected that if we ’d been there in person , I would have hit her hard enough to kill her .   
As part of that thought , I well and truly believed that had I hit her hard enough to kill her , I would have felt better .
Cryptid dropped his costume - projection , becoming Chris in the process .   
stretched on his way to the door , taking only a short detour to grab his bag and coat , flipping his hood up to brave the rain .
“ You ’ll be okay ?
” Sveta asked him .
“ I have a form prepared .
”
The door slammed behind him .
Capricorn immediately began shucking off armor .   
Sveta backed away from the consoles , while Swansong and Precipice exchanged looks- Precipice losing his mask to become regular Rain .   
It was done .   
That was the meeting .
“ That could have gone worse , ” Rain said .
“
Yeah , ” Capricorn said .   
“ Like Victoria said , the effect from her is n’t that bad .
”
“ Tolerable , ” I said , again .
“
Are you okay ?
” Sveta asked me .
I shrugged one shoulder and shook my head .
“
Did it help to get things off your chest ?
”
“ If it did , it was outweighed by how much that sucked in general , ” I said .   
“
I do n’t know if it helped .   
Ask me again in a week , when I ’ve replayed these conversations and those expressions over and over in my head a thousand times .
”
“ For what it ’s worth , ” Tristan said .   
“
Thanks for coming , Victoria .   
I think someone as powerful as Bianca is used to getting her way .   
If you had n’t been here , the meeting would n’t have happened , and she would have plowed forward- probably triggering the trap .
”
“ They ’d shut off the prison portals , cutting it off from everyone and everything , ” Sveta said .   
“
Except maybe the man who can apparently travel between dimensions .
”
“
At least now we have Cryptid on the case , and he ’s guiding the game plan , ” Tristan said .
“ That does n’t make me super confident , ” I told him .
“
It ’s better than what it looked like we were going to be doing with her , ” Tristan said .   
“
We ’ll find a way to help Goddess and we ’ll do it while avoiding hurting the other teams .
” I walked over to Ashley and Rain , my arms folded .
Rain was walking over to Tristan , noting the gear , his attention on tables and tinkerings .   
Lost in thought .   
It had to be a tricky situation , to be so far away and so relatively helpless .   
He ’d be more helpless if they figured out he was spending hours a day in front of his computer and logging next to no hours online .
And then there was Swansong .   
Ashley .   
She stared at a point on the table like she wanted to kill it .
“ You ’ve been quiet , ”
I observed , to Ashley .
“
I ’m trying not to think , so
I do n’t fall into her way of thinking .   
I think I ’m slowly losing .
”
“
It ’s fine , we ’re fine , ” Kenzie said .   
She had removed her helmet .   
“
Chris is gone , which sucks , but we ’re all mostly okay .
”
“ I do n’t think we are , ” Sveta said , her voice gentle .   
“
But we have a way forward .   
We ’ll have to rely on Chris to handle his end of things .   
In the meantime , we do what we need to .
”
Tristan was still pulling off his armor .   
“
We should touch base with the other teams .   
If we ’re going to get information , it should be soon .   
Byron , I owe you time , but can you do me a favor , and let me swap back to pick up my gear before you leave to go anywhere .
”
Tristan blurred .   
In frame and the color of the clothes he wore , he changed .   
The momentary blur faded .
I saw Byron with his eyes wide , like the deer in the headlights .   
I knew , with the same certainty that I ’d known she had us .   
He was unarmored and unarmed , and wholly his usual self- which was also the self that would look most alarmed by the status quo .
She did n’t have him .
“ Think very carefully about what you do next , ” I said .
“ I ’ve had a pretty level head when it comes to sitting in the back seat and watching someone do something awful .   
I ’m careful , do n’t worry , ” Byron said .
His movements betrayed his words .   
He backed up , moving toward the largest , most empty portion of the room .
“ Byron , ” I said .   
“
If you make this whole thing more complicated than it is , there ’s a chance people get hurt .   
A chance Rain and Ashley get hurt , their legs blown off or they ’re stuck on a prison world with no way out .   
There are bystanders .   
Prison staff who could get hurt .
”
“ I can sympathize with your sister in this , ” he said .
I winced .   
“ Bad choice of words .
”
“
In this .   
Trying to deal with you , when you ’re like this .
”
“
It ’s not major , ” Sveta said .
“ Are you telling me that in your current state of mind , you would n’t hurt a bystander if it helped her ?
”
I paused , my thoughts working out the best possible answer , which took some doing , since it was pretty far from what I might have normally said .
“
There ’s always a chance I hurt someone , ” Sveta said .   
“
And I lead the most selfish existence because I go through everyday life
and I do the costumed thing despite that chance .
”
“ I know , ” Byron said .   
“
But … would you willingly do it , instead of your body doing it ?   
If it helped her ?
” Sveta did n’t answer .   
I could see her eyes move .
“ I might , ” I said .
“
Then you ’re not you , ” he said .
Kenzie was in the back , staring .   
But she was on our side .
Rain was behind Byron , but Rain was limited in what he could do .   
He was a ghost .
Ashley , too .   
But Ashley stepped forward , talking .   
“
That ’s not the way it works .   
When your brother said something about leveling the city , she said it was n’t something he was capable of .   
It has to be something you ’re capable of .
”
“ You think you ’re capable ?
” Byron asked me .
“ I came close with Valefor .   
Raise the stakes ,
and-
”
“
You keep saying that .   
You got that from the Lady in Blue .   
You and Kenzie are the good ones .   
The only ones besides me who have n’t killed .   
You ca n’t be so casual about it .
”
“ It ’s not being casual about that , ” Ashley said .   
“
It ’s about being serious about this .
”
“
I was thinking about what we could do .   
She wanted the connection so she could get people right ?
”
Lookout asked .   
“ If they see her on camera , she can take control over them .   
If we do that enough times , we can get an army .
”
“ See , that ?   
That ’s terrifying , ” Byron said .   
“
That does n’t sound like you , Kenz .
”
“
It ’s a plan , ” Sveta said .
The lighting in the room changed .   
It was Byron ’s motes- like fireflies that left lines drawn in the air as they traveled their lazy helixes and loops .   
All around Kenzie ’s workstation and tinkerings .
“
No , no , no , ” Kenzie said .
“ You guys broke free of Valefor .   
Ca n’t you break free of this ?
” he asked .   
The water - to - be floated around the computers and things like a knife held to a person ’s throat .   
Kenzie ’s work .
I shook my head slowly .   
I was n’t the only one .   
Sveta did too , the logistics of her body obviously applying .
“ Byron , ” I said .   
“ Switch back with your brother .   
Take a backseat role while we do the high - risk stuff .   
I know you did n’t ask for this life , and there ’s no reason you should be caught up in something bigger .
”
“ I do n’t think I ’m going to do that .   
The problem with the powers thing is that it sweeps through everything and leaves ruin and devastation , ” Byron told me .
“ It does .
”
“
This is a lot of really big powers in one persons’ hands , and she ’s catching you guys up in her wake .   
She would have caught me too , if I was out and Tristan was in , like he was supposed to be .   
We ca n’t let that be a thing- the devastation .   
I do n’t want that here , with you guys .
”
“
Two of us are n’t really here , ” Rain observed .   
“
Whatever we ’re made of , it ’s cracked and broken .
”
“
No , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I do n’t believe that .   
Because they ’re still here .   
They ’re here in the way that counts .
”
“ Maybe , ” Byron said .   
“
But I ’m not sure that ’s true .   
That Woman in Blue is not equipped to lead .   
As far as I can tell , that ’s a woman who was younger than I am now when she took over her planet , and nobody was strong enough to stop her .   
She did n’t know how to lead , she just … things work out because she keeps everyone united in fear , if they ’re unpowered , or united under her banner if they ’re powered .   
She ’s spoiled and unhinged .   
I ca n’t see a good outcome from that .   
If I do n’t take a stand here , there ’s going to be more ruin and devastation .   
This whole thing needs to stop now if we ’re going to keep this from ruining Breakthrough , hurting the other heroes , letting Teacher or Goddess win , or letting both win while everyone else loses
…
”
There was a pause .   
I suspected nobody involved really wanted to pick a fight or force a move .   
Too messy .
“
Um , I ’m sorry to interrupt , ” Kenzie said .   
There was nothing to interrupt , really .   
“
Your Malfunction Junction guys have an major update , Victoria .   
Please do n’t drench my workstation , Byron .
”
“ Noted .   
Thank you , Kenzie , ” I said .   
My voice was empty of emotion .   
My expression was unflinching , as I stared down Byron , one corner of my eye noting the blue motes .   
The stalemate continued .
Ashley was stock still , watching .   
Sveta circled the room , flanking him .
He rushed me .   
I held up hands to either side , telling the others not to intervene .
With fear clutching my heart to alternately slow and hurry its beats , a sick weight in my stomach , and nervous energy running angry through my limbs , I caught Byron ’s wrist as he reached for me , pulled it down , and used flight to help step into his stride , planting one foot such that it was right behind his , the length of my leg leaning against the side of his knee , keeping him from extending his leg .   
It put him off balance , and he grabbed me to try and regain that balance .
I did n’t need to care about weight or balance .   
I let flight carry me off the ground , got to the point my foot could touch down , and with a push forward , drove myself into him .   
He tumbled to the ground , started to grab my breastplate with both hands- and ended up grabbing it by one hand , because he might have stabbed himself on decorative spikes if he ’d used the other hand .
He tried to pull me down on top of him , and I used flight to help arrest my fall .   
He was hanging off of my breastplate now .
“ You have to realize there ’s something wrong here !
” he grunted .
Even being out of practice , after having my arm in a sling , followed by a move that saw my weights and bars packed up , and even with my injured arm not being at one hundred percent , I was stronger than him .   
His build was the build of an average guy who ate and exercised an average amount , but who had also never developed his strength .
Because it would make him too similar to his brother , maybe .
I hit his sternum with the heel of my hand .   
He let go , and he dropped to the floor .   
All of the negative emotions were stronger , not better , after this exercise , and it pained me .   
I did n’t want this to continue , I did n’t want to think about the situation with Goddess and Amy .
“ Victoria !
” Sveta called out .   
“
Above !
”
Water hit me
perhaps half of a bathtub ’s worth , with no pressure beyond the fact it dropped from ten or so feet above me .   
But the weight of it and the surprise made me sag , bringing me close enough for Byron to grab .
He ’d had training .   
He was rustier than I was , but something went into him gripping my armor and the cloth of my costume , and using that leverage to hurl himself from a lying - down position to a position where he was beside me , pushing me .   
Blue motes swirled around us .
“ Give me something !
” he said .
There was desperation in his voice , like there had been desperation in Amy ’s .   
He gripped my throat , the whites of his eyes showing as he stared me in the face , and then he let go just as quickly .   
My skin did n’t feel like my skin as his fingers slid off of it .   
Slick with anxiety sweat , prickled with the goosebumps of cold , even though I was hot in this outfit , in a room with too many hot lights overhead , with muggy wet weather outside .
I got a grip on the shoulder of his v - neck shirt , and used flight to wing around him , twisting up his shirt and putting my arm part of the way around his neck .   
I started to pull my arm into a proper headlock .   
He knew how to break it .
Had I used my strength , the Wretch would have torn him to shreds .   
This was the scenario Uncle Neil had been preparing me for when he ’d sparred with me .
I ’d sparred with Dean too .   
Roughhousing and real sparring both .   
The difference was that Byron kept trying to grab me , but Dean had been more of a striker .
“
What do I say to convince you ! ?
”
Byron brought his leg around , hard enough to bruise my side , and tried to use the momentum of the kick to drive me closer to the ground , where he could try to grab me again .   
I was n’t sure what he aimed to accomplish .
I knew what my goal was , though .   
To grab him , subdue him , and if we could n’t have him become Tristan again , we would keep him from calling the wrong people until Goddess could bring more people onto her team .
Again , I tried the head - lock .   
I let my aura burn at ember - level heat , my cold breastplate pressed against his back , the icon at the pointed top near my clavicle pressing in between his shoulder blades .   
As I ’d used my flight to stress myself , I put weight on his shoulders , pressing him down with more than just my physical weight .   
His legs buckled .
“ Victoria , ” he said , his voice strangled .
“ You should n’t be able to talk that easily .
”
“
Apparently … perk of .. water - focused power .   
Did n’t know , ” he said , each couple or trio of words heaved out with a fresh breath .
I maintained the pressure .   
It was having some effect .   
I gave Sveta a look , a jerk of my head .   
She ’d help .   
We ’d bind him if I could n’t make him pass out .
“
Master stranger , ” he said .   
“ Master stranger protocols .   
You have to have studied them .
”
Master stranger .   
It put me in mind of my study sessions with Dean .
A second thought of Dean .   
It was refreshing and bright when everything else felt so dark .
“
You ’ve been a hero since birth .   
You studied this shit .   
You have to know this .   
They drilled us on it in Reach , you-
” he huffed out a laugh .   
“
You probably enjoyed it .
”
I nodded , unable to speak , as if I was the one being choked .
“ Follow the protocols , ” he said .
Sveta had reached us .   
She had straps that had been used to bind boxes closed .
“ Follow the protocols , ” he said .   
“ You ’re compromised .   
You know you just interacted with a strong Master .   
Your team ’s at stake .   
Master stranger protocols .
”
It was such a subtle effect , was n’t it ?   
I felt like I ’d barely been influenced .
I released him .   
Sveta grabbed my wrist , hard , like I was the danger , all of a sudden .
“
It ’s fine , ” I said .   
“ Trust me .
”
I was n’t sure it was fine .   
I was n’t sure I trusted this .   
This course of action felt wrong .
“
It ’s fine , ” Byron said .   
“ I wo n’t cause trouble .
”
Sveta bit her lip .   
She released my wrist .
I did n’t feel quite as lousy as before .   
Less fear , less bile , less anger .   
A whole lot more doubt .
As if Goddess and my sister both were power so great that they had their own gravity .   
As Byron had said , they left chaos in their wake .   
Devastation , if we were n’t careful .
“
The Major Malfunctions have something ?
”
I asked , trying to change the subject away from Byron .
“
They moved on to another prison employee .   
He turned out to be shady .   
They ’re waiting for backup before they act on it .   
It ’s what we ’re looking for , and it ’s what Goddess wants .
”
I closed my eyes for a moment .
“ I ’ll go with Byron , ” I said .
“
You ’re sure , ”
Sveta ’s tone made the question a non - question , more of an accusation .   
I was crazy to do this .
“ Have to be .   
We ca n’t leave the kids alone with him .   
He is interested in helping , right ?
”
“
Yes , ” Byron said .
“ I can manage him .   
Can you get the info from Kenz ?
” I asked .
She gave me a dubious look , but she went to do it .
When it was the two of us again , I lowered my eyes to the ground , and with words I scarcely believed in , lit by a glow of warm feeling .
That feeling emanated from a scene in the back of my mind , of me studying classifications with my boyfriend .   
I ’d honor that memory by throwing myself into this morass of doubt , this wrong feeling , when the last thing I wanted was to feel the weight of more wrongs .
“
You ’re going to have to steer me away from the wrong kinds of actions , ” my voice was a whisper , words in confidence to a person I did n’t know well enough to have confidence in .
“
Okay .   
Thank you ,
” Byron whispered back .








I let Byron be the one to step outside , with me following .   
It gave me time to think about what I was going to say to the others , and it was symbolic of my course of action here-
he would lead , and I ’d support .
The freezing rain had already coated the fire escape .   
The strength of the wind this close to the breached Norwalk portal made the icicles slanted , more sideways than down .
“
Do you want a hood or covering ?   
We could probably cobble something up , ” I told Byron .
“
I ’m fine , ” he said , stepping down from the base of the door to the metal slats of the fire escape .   
The rain pelted his armor and helmet , and he did n’t flinch .   
I saw his shoulders rise , then fall very suddenly .   
A deep breath , his breath fogging out from the mouth portion of the helmet .
He dropped a clump of metal and chain onto the fire escape , then bent down , slipping his feet into them .
“ Strap - on cleats ?
” I asked .
“
Yeah , crampons , ” he said .   
“
I never thought I ’d have reason to use these again .
”
“ It ca n’t be because of where you lived-
you were … North Carolina ?
”
“ Reach was Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina , and South Carolina .   
We were Maryland originally .   
No , you ’re right , it was to work with powers .   
I ’m surprised you did n’t know what these are called , living more north .
”
“ Our winters were n’t too bad , in Brockton Bay , and I fly , remember ?
”
Another puff of breath , like a laugh .
“ Power related ?
” I asked .
“
Yeah , ” he said .   
“
For a little while , I was ice .
”
“
Do you know what made it change ?
”
“ We have ideas .   
If it was any of those ideas , it ’s not worth trying to do it again .   
Too costly , with a lot of bad memories .
” I could imagine .   
Murder .   
A team breaking up .
“
I can relate , I suppose , ” I said .
“
Maybe , yeah ,
” he said , his head turning my way .   
I ’d read articles about helmets and how a given shape of opening or slit for the eyes could be heroic or villainous , or evoke a certain effect .   
His was more open and ‘ heroic’ , tracing the general outline of the eye socket , just low enough at the brow to cover the eyebrows , but even though the lighting touched his armor and the rivulets of moisture that ran down it , it did n’t let me see more than a faint reflection in the natural moisture of his eye .
I was supposed to trust him , rather than my instincts and thought processes both .
His breath fogged , very alive in contrast to the stillness of the rest of him .   
“
It ’s weird , having a normal conversation when there ’s so much screwed up stuff going on .
”
“
Let ’s not dwell on that stuff if we do n’t have to .
”
“ Should n’t we ?
”
“ I do n’t think there ’s any good answers , and it does n’t change anything .   
You take point , you make the final calls .
”
He nodded slowly .
I indicated his feet .   
“
You having those is handy , but we ’re not exactly walking .   
Are you going to be okay driving in this ?
”
“
No idea , ” he said .   
“
I ’m an okay driver , but I ’ve never driven in weather like this .
”
“ If you want , I can fly alongside .   
If there ’s a problem , I could … do some exterior damage to the car , but maybe make it stop .
”
“ You can fly in this ?
” he asked .
I winced , stepping outside , the door still open behind me .   
My hood was up , the icon at my forehead , and my hair was tied back .   
The hood was pinned to my hair at either corner of my brow- it would n’t move naturally or flow right , but I doubted it mattered-
I just wanted it to stay up when the rain was coming down .
I was wearing a tight - fitting waterproof jacket over the hooded portion of my outfit , waterproof , and the ornamentation that helped keep my hood in place kept the one hood nestled in the other .   
I had better gloves , and I had tights on underneath the tight - fitting black pants .
I was n’t sure I would be terrifically comfortable , even with those precautions , but we did n’t have a lot of choice .
“
Yes .   
We ’ll both do our best , ” I said .
“
And-
I know we said we would n’t discuss it , but-
” he started .   
He lowered his voice .   
“
I can trust you ?   
You wo n’t … help Goddess by dealing with me ?
”
Funny , to have the idea turned back on me , when I was the one making the leap of faith .
I thought about it .   
It seemed like I could , if he was a real threat , if I was more willing to kill .   
It would even make sense .
“
You ’re taking about two seconds too long to answer that , ” he said .
“
You can trust me , and I ’m extending my trust to you because you ’re right .   
There are a lot of factors that could mean
I ’m compromised .   
We ’re both helping her , because we ’re both dealing with the same threats .
”
“
Sure , ” he said .
I imagined he was thinking about the same thing
I was-
the question of what happened if I had to choose between him and Goddess in a more explicit way .
Speckles of moisture were already beading my face .   
My costume seemed to be keeping the worst of it off , but it made me aware of the time spent standing in the rain , making no headway .
I turned toward the door , paused to think for a second , double - check my thought processes , and then leaned partway inside .
“ Kenzie .
”
She was at her desk , helmet off , costume on .   
She spun in a half circle , putting her hands out to either side and behind her to catch the desk and stop .   
“
Yes ?
”
“
Do n’t do anything .
”
“ I know .   
You guys already decided we should n’t .
”
“
Really .   
Do n’t .   
Talk to us first if you ’re considering anything .
”
“ I wo n’t !   
We ’re good .   
I am low - key - enzie right now , ” she paused , glancing around the room .   
“
I miss Chris already .   
He would ’ve liked that .
”
“ I can guarantee he would n’t have , ” Rain said .
“ He likes snarking because it makes him feel clever , so if I set ’em up so he can knock ’em down , he gets to feel good , and I do n’t mind because it ’s just me being a dork .
”
“
I ’m not sure about that ,
but okay , ” Rain said .
Kenzie turned my way .   
I stared at her , and I saw a slight smile on her face , uncertainty .
“
Do n’t take any actions , approach anyone , or give Goddess a line of communication to other teams until you ’ve talked to us .   
We ’re going to be super close to the front , dealing with sensitive matters .   
The wrong action at the wrong time could make our enemies unpredictable or change up the dynamic .
”
I ’d been trying to think of a convincing reason for her to stay put and stay away since before holding the door for Byron to step outside .   
This was the best I could manage .
There was a pause .
“
Fiiiiine ,
” Kenzie said , like she was finally conceding the point in a long argument .
“ I ’ll watch her , ” Sveta said .
I glanced at Ashley , who was still being quiet , lost in concentration .
“ Victoria , ” Sveta spoke up in a sudden way that suggested she ’d had to push herself to say it .   
“ Is Byron close enough to hear ?
” I turned my head .   
“
He headed down to the car to warm it up .
”
“ Byron was supposed to give Tristan control .   
What ’s going on ?
”
This was hard .   
Hard like convincing myself to walk into traffic blindfolded .   
I did n’t have a ready answer .
“ I do n’t like teammates fighting , ” she said .   
“
And I do n’t trust Byron like this .
”
“
I normally like Byron , but I agree with Sveta , ” Rain said .
I tried to give an answer , “ If we have them swapping back and forth , they ’re going to fight each other , or Tristan ’s going to keep control , and we ’ll pay for that in spades later .
”
“
So you ’re choosing Byron ?   
Taking sides is also the kind of thing we pay for , ” Sveta said .
“ I know .   
But honestly , Byron ’s more powerful in this situation .
”
“
His power is weaker right now , ” Rain said .
“ It might not have as much density or water pressure or … whatever it is that ’s different , but it ’s water .   
It ’s sprays of water when it ’s as cold as tits outside .   
I can beat him in a fight-
I just proved that .   
I do n’t think the water pressure that he has right now would go through my forcefield .   
Trust me on this ?
”
“
Earlier , he asked if you ’d be willing to kill someone , ” Ashley said .   
All eyes turned to her .   
“
You said yes .
”
“ I might , ” I said .   
“
What does that have to do with Byron ?
”
“
Would you be willing to kill him ?
” she asked .
I was aware of everyone ’s gaze .   
I was aware of every inch of me , of my already damp costume , and the sudden realization that when I ’d said yes , it might have been Amy that was my exception .
Valefor , I could hurt him so badly that he might die without care , and I was okay with that .   
I could go that far and if death happened , I believed I could make my peace with it .
Peace was also the idea at the root of my thought about Amy .   
She was the person I might kill for reasons other than protecting others .   
The circumstances would have to be pressing , I ’d have to be worn down or otherwise not at my best and most clear - headed , but I could see myself doing it .
I could imagine myself being less miserable in the aftermath , somehow .   
Wrestling with shame and self loathing in the aftermath of something like that was better than wrestling with oblique shame , self loathing , and the daily fear of either running into her or a repeat incident of her using her power on me .
I knew it was n’t rational , that it would n’t bring me peace or an end to the worrying .   
But my thoughts could go there .
I had to look troubled , thinking like this .   
I looked at the others and I finally gave my response- a nod .   
If I spoke , I felt like it would sound like a lie .
“
Good luck , if it comes to that .   
I really hope it does n’t .
”
“
Thanks , Kenz .   
Me too .
”
“ Be safe , ” Sveta said .
I closed the door .   
When I turned around , Byron was still there .   
He was n’t down at the car .   
It had been important that he hear .
“ Shit , that ’s scary , ” he said , his voice so quiet that the drum of rain on every surface nearly drowned him out .
“
Let ’s go .   
Try not to make too much noise on the stairs , ” I said .   
He nodded .
I ended up giving him a hand , floating on the far side of the railing , my hand on his upper arm as he made his way down .
Doubts crept over me .   
I could n’t kill him
–
I was n’t sure I had that in me .   
That had been a lie .   
I knew I could maim him , though , break him enough that it would take him a long time to heal , and that gave my troubled thoughts some peace- until I remembered I was supposed to be viewing my own thoughts through a lens , that this was n’t a good thing .
He started up the car , while I floated above , the Wretch out and shielding me from the freezing rain and the wind .   
I knew the rain was tracing its outline , but the alternative would be intolerable .
Travel advisories had been out regarding the rain .   
Too many cars lacked the tires for dealing with weather like this , with supply being short , and there were n’t any trucks to salt the ice , no work trucks clearing the roads .   
If last year was any indicator , the paralysis of winter would affect most people more than the lack of food supplies .
Tristan or Byron had at least looked after their tires .   
Once he found his course , fishtailing a bit as he turned one corner , correcting for the swerve , it seemed we were good to go .
Master - stranger protocols .   
PRT and the organization under its umbrella had it in handbooks , and it was one of the things people got quizzed on .   
Some of the largest departments had scenarios and surprise drills .
Thinking about the paperwork helped .   
Black text on white .   
Strict rules to be followed .
With a strong master - stranger of this type , we were supposed to implement eyes - on protocols .   
Once someone left our sight , they were to be assumed to be compromised .   
Did n’t matter , it did n’t apply here , until Byron started talking to people and tried to get them on his side against Goddess .
Flying through the dark with the Wretch active and the rain coming down had my heart pounding .   
When the streetlights illuminated the raindrops , the Wretch was made briefly visible , the direction they were facing made ambiguous by the fact that only the surface was being seen .   
Hands reaching , faces neutral .
Black text on white , I thought , turning my attention away from the images in my peripheral vision and toward the car .   
Byron was doing fine , but the roads were clear of vehicles .   
What had I been thinking about ?   
I had to remind myself .   
The eyes - on protocol should n’t matter in this case .
What did matter was the system for when people were compromised .   
Being rushed , agitated or otherwise reckless when everything was fucked up was a good way to make mistakes , so the first step was to get to a position where decisions could be made with care and deliberation .   
Not so different from my warrior monk approach .
Chain of command automatically passed down the chain as though people were dead or out of action .   
If discussions of the chain of command took more than a set amount of time or if the affected individuals could n’t be trusted or detained , it meant a mission abort to a safe location with self - isolation once there .   
A good team with the right organization would see the leader step down the moment he might be compromised , the next person taking up the mantle .
The wind was more intense as we got closer to the Norwalk portal breach .   
On the upside , the sky on the far side was clear and bright , a slice of blue at the horizon , and the weather that extended out around it was rain - free .   
The precipitation was n’t as bad , here .
Light blue .   
It was the late afternoon , I had to remind myself .   
Waking up early and the sky being so overcast it was black was throwing me .
I heard a rev .   
Byron picked up speed as he reached road that was n’t icy .
“
Careful , ” I murmured .
The mere mention of the protocols and this course of action was supposed to be cause for a leader to quickly step down .   
If their second - in - command was the one to raise the issue , the third - in - command took over , to prevent the protocol from being weaponized by the compromised .
A really good team would default to the core approach for whatever the threat was .   
Defer command to the most capable person believed to be uncompromised , or to HQ if comms still worked , then stick to the protocols for dealing with strangers , or the protocols for dealing with masters .
I was aware that in this case we were dealing with a master .   
The protocol ?   
Take them the fuck out .   
Second priority , right after the thinkers , who were ASAP - level .   
Ninety - nine percent of the time , taking the master out of consideration also dealt with the control .
I felt nervous at the idea that Byron might be driving , his own mind going a mile a minute as he reminded himself of protocols and options , figuring out a game plan , with eliminating Goddess as his end - goal .
It was wind and a thin layer of moisture that saw Byron lose his traction , his vehicle sliding over the dotted yellow line that marked the division between lanes .   
No ice here , but it did n’t matter .
I landed on the roof , ready to act if I had to-
it meant having the wretch down , my hood flapping violently , the pins in my hair pulling at the roots until I ducked my head lower , droplets of moisture stabbing at my face-
it was n’t freezing rain , at least ; it stabbed only because of the speeds involved .
There was no incoming traffic , the turn he made to get back in the right lane felt too drastic , forcing an overcorrection the other way .   
He came perilously close to steering into one of the memorial posts-
there were n’t many here , but someone had situated one near the corner of an intersection .
Before I could activate the wretch , grab the car , and try to force a correction , he got things back under control .   
There would n’t be handprints in the car exterior .
We drove around the north of the portal .   
A slice of sky revealing the barren world on the far side , the sky nonetheless blue , the weather relatively calm there .   
To our south , buildings were illuminated , people trying to go about their days , waiting for the weather to clear .   
To our north , some artificial lights and the headlights of vehicles illuminated the spaces where farmers were trying to save crops , and where people were hurrying to handle the weather in tent cities .
He ’d slowed down , both because of the scare and because of the upsurge in traffic near here .   
Which was good .   
He slowed down more as the freezing rain resumed in its full intensity , the roads icy once again .
Past the breach in reality that was almost an oasis in this weather , into the thicker portions of the city .
It was n’t far from here .   
If we had n’t had to pause to find our way in an area that was too dark , with no street signs or landmarks , it would have taken four or five minutes .
I let the Wretch fall away , the ice that had collected in the crevices dropping down to pelt the car , which had slowed .
Two pink circles gave away Withdrawal ’s location .   
The lenses of his mask glowed neon in the gloom , as did some of the oils of his costume .   
I raised a hand , and he raised his .
He was quick and silent as he approached , moving on three limbs while holding his giant syringe with the fourth .   
The syringe attachment looked more like a nozzle , today .
“
I ’ll let the others know you ’re here , ” he said , as I floated closer .   
Byron got out of the car behind me .   
His voice was muffled by his mask .   
Ice had crusted around the places in his mask where his breath filtered out .
“
Alright , ” I said .
“
Can ya go easy on Finale ?
” he asked .
“ Easy ?
”
“
She thinks we did this wrong , and we ca n’t convince her different .
” I nodded .   
I was worried what ‘ wrong’ constituted , when so much about tonight felt wrong , but I ’d wait until I had information .   
With a possibly altered mental state , moving slow and carefully was critical .   
It was point one of the protocols .
Well , point one would have been to not attend , but sitting out was really not my thing .
The bright lenses of his mask left trails in my vision as he nodded back .   
He did n’t cross the street directly , instead hopping over to where the shadows were deeper , a narrow band of dark extending across the road where the pools of light from streetlights did n’t quite meet .   
He crossed that band , barely visible .
If he was being stealthier , I would be too .   
I dropped to ground , stepping close to the car .
“
What do I need to know about these guys ?
”
Byron asked .   
“
I know the basics .
”
“ Inexperienced , but eager .   
That was Withdrawal , the tinker .   
Caryatid is their not - so - mobile breaker .   
Finale is a blaster that lacks confidence .   
Lots of potential across the team , but they never broke ground .   
This is one of their first outings .   
Too small a team to be on most people ’s radars .
” Byron nodded .   
“ Not Goddess’ radar , then .
”
“ Should n’t be .
”
He nodded .
Across the street , in the copse of old trees that were bounded in on four sides by the suburb - like neighborhood , a slice of nature that had been preserved as everything else was cleared away and a pre - fab neighborhood was dropped down , bubblegum pink lenses appeared out of the darkness .   
I saw the syringe appear in a similar way , the fluid going from dark to pink , bubbling visibly , until it was as neon pink as anything else .   
He moved it like a baton , waving us over .
I took a course that used the same shadows Withdrawal had .   
Byron followed after me .
They were gathered in the trees , out of sight of the rest of the neighborhood .   
Finale wore a blue poncho over her costume .   
Caryatid wore something similar , but it was black and more voluminous .   
Her arms were folded in the midst of it , so the bright yellow and orange of the sleeves were hidden .
Withdrawal had gone completely dark .   
I saw him set his syringe down and lean against a tree .   
With his elongated limbs , the stilt - like legs , he looked very tall as he peered down at us
, his head difficult to see in the branches of a mature tree .
Caryatid was positioned where she could stand with her back to a tree , looking over one shoulder in the direction of a quaint house .   
It was the prefab sort of home , a little more boxy than what would have passed for usual back on Bet , too similar to other houses on the block , but it was still nice enough .
“
I ’m
sorry
we did n’t listen , ” Finale said .
“
Did something happen ?
” I asked .
“
No , ” Caryatid said .
“ We did stuff in the wrong order , ” Finale said .
“ We did n’t .   
The order did n’t matter , ” Withdrawal said .
“
But … the names had numbers by them .
”
“
Can I explain ?   
They ’ll tell us if it was wrong , ” Withdrawal said .   
His tone was patient , the rest of him exasperated .
“
Yeah , sure , ” Finale said , an accent creeping into her voice , a truncated ‘ yeah’ .   
She sounded defeated .
“
We were tracking target number one .   
Staff medical .   
He met with a coworker halfway through the work day .   
That coworker was also on our list .   
Staff medical number two .   
She has shopping bags in her very nice car , and she paid for the lunch .
”
“
She had some nice clothes , ” Caryatid said .   
Her breaker form was stirring around her legs .   
Partially but not completely entered into .   
Slowly , it crept up her legs .   
She did n’t have to make it slow , I knew .   
A way of staying warm ?
“
Yeah , ” Withdrawal said .   
“
We switched to following her , because whatever she ’s doing , it seemed off .
”
“
Sounds right , ” I said .   
“
Something came up ?
”
“ You know when they have an officer do regular checkups ?   
Making you part of their patrol , because they ’re all concerned - like ? ”
Withdrawal asked .
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“ There are people doing that for her .   
We do n’t think they ’re officers .
”
“
What do they look like ?
” Byron asked .
“
This is Capricorn , by the way , ” I said .
“
Hi Capricorn .   
Saw you on T.V. the other night , ” Withdrawal replied .   
“ They were driving average looking cars , but they ’d slow down as they drove by , attention on the house .
”
“
What makes you sure they ’re not after her ?
” Byron asked .
“
One got out of their car , ” Withdrawal said .   
“
They talked , guy on the sidewalk , woman standing on her front stairs .   
Friendly - like
. ”
“
What did they look like ?
” I asked .
“ Normal , ” Withdrawal said .   
“ Regular clothes , jackets .   
Cars were mostly the same , beaters from Bet or garbage from Gimel .   
They dressed normal .   
But normal does n’t circle the same block five or six times , driving real slow as they pass a house .
”
“
This is good , ” Byron said .   
“
Exactly the kind of thing we were hoping to get with the surveillance .
”
“ Agreed , ” I added .
“
Really ?
” Finale asked .
“
Really , ” I said , with conviction and extra emphasis .
“ Finale was the one who saw the shopping bags , ” Withdrawal said .   
“
Got us thinking about what was up with this woman .
”
“ Fantastic , ” I said , meeting Finale ’s eyes .
Even in the gloom , everything already dark , made darker by the trees around us , I could see Finale smile .
“
What do we do ?
”
Withdrawal asked .
I wanted to respond .   
I glanced at Capricorn , instead .   
If I was compromised , it was his voice that mattered .
“
We call for help , ” he said .   
“
This is bigger than us .
”
“ One of the major teams ?
” I asked .
“
We ’re not sure what ’s going on with them , ” he said .   
“ Protocols .   
But I think it ’s reasonable to assume that the most major team is clear .
”
“ If they ’re available , ” I said .
“ Major ?
” Finale asked .
“ Wardens , ” I stated .   
I saw her eyes go wider .   
For her benefit , I added , “ Dragon , Defiant , Narwhal , Chevalier-
”
“ Most are away , ” Byron said .   
“ Give me a second .
”
He pulled out his phone .
“
How was your stakeout ?
”
I murmured , while Byron stepped a bit away , plugging a jack into his phone .
“
Cold , wet , strangely exciting for there being so little happening for hours .   
We kept each other company .
”   
Withdrawal said .   
“ Listened to music when we were n’t watching out .
”
“ Withdrawal has recordings of a really funny radio musical , ” Finale said , suddenly effuse , just over the mention of this thing she ’d enjoyed .   
I smiled a bit , seeing it .
Caryatid , meanwhile , was almost one with the trees .   
She looked out in the direction of the house , but her face was one of butterfly wings overlapping , unfolding , flapping .
“ Antares , ” Byron said .   
“ Look .
” I looked .
It was his phone .   
Red triangles cascaded down the screen , each with an old fashioned phone in the center .   
Network down , no service , no tower available .
I checked my own phone .   
Following my cue , the    others checked theirs .
Caryatid dropped out of her breaker form , the butterfly - winged face slipping back to reveal her normal one .   
I saw her expression change .   
“
They ’re on the phone .
”
“
Who ?
”
“
All of them .
”
I had to step closer to a tree to look .
At the end of the driveway , a man that wore a heavy raincoat was talking on the phone .
“ They know .   
They had safeguards in place , ”
I spoke my realization aloud .   
“
They ’re onto us .
” ‘ Onto us’ meant that cars were already approaching .   
One stopped in front of the house .   
People got out , and they wore a hodgepodge assortment of gear over white , simple masks on their faces .
Teacher ’s thralls .
More cars were arriving –
they had to have been parked in nearby driveways or a side road .   
They kept stopping and getting out , their lack of parking jobs meant not solely to hold them back , but to obstruct traffic .
Obstruct emergency services .
There were people in one car who were working as a team to get something big from one of the trunks .   
When the group moved , this long case in their possession , they did it with at least twelve people protecting the case .
The destination : the same house the woman from the prison clinic lived in .
“
I ’ll try to help , ” Withdrawal said .
A spray of laser shots flew through the trees .   
Trunks splintered , and whole sheaths of brittle mark were cast off , sent flipping through the air .
I could see the alarm on the Malfunctions’ faces .
“ They keep adding more , ” Finale said .   
“
I ca n’t do anything if they just endlessly add more .
”
“
We ’re okay , ” I said .   
“
Run if you need to .   
They should let you .   
They do n’t want the casualties it could involve .
”
More laser shots now .   
More damaged trees .   
What a shame .
Goddess had outlined a way that her enemies would pin her and defeat her .   
Coordinated groups , seemingly endless numbers , a sharp offense coordinated by thinkers .   
There was no information that they did n’t potentially have , no problem we could pose that would fatigue this intelligent morass of humans .
“ Is there any way to get a message across on the secure line ?
”
I asked .   
“
The one we ’re not supposed to have ?
”
“
I ’ll try , ” Byron said .   
“ Figure out what they ’re up to !   
We stop and interfere , but the information is key .
”
He was the one in charge , with the protocols .   
I took off .   
“ Be safe , Malfunctions .   
Be safe , Byron .
”
The enemy numbers kept increasing .
Against thinkers , take them out ASAP .   
Distract , stress , befuddle .   
Mental and psychological strain , when it can be applied , should be used , as they have an ironic tendency to have their minds be their weak points .
I used my aura , hard , and probably disturbed some ordinary residents in the neighborhood in the process .   
Someone fell , losing their bag , and I grabbed it .   
I hurled the bag at the largest cluster of thralls .
There had to be thirty of them .   
Three to five to a car- six cars .   
What had been an orderly suburb was chaos , drowned in freezing rain , a thin film of ice crusting anything that was getting rained on .
They turned guns on me , and I flew up and away , trusting the darkness and the rain that fell in people
’s eyes to give me cover .   
The bright shots stabbed randomly up into the sky .   
There were some that did n’t need eyes , instead having powers that Teacher had granted , but they were wretched , less people with added enhancements , and more slaves who had lost more than they ’d gained in ability .
It was easier , like this .   
No doubts , a clear enemy , no having to juggle my allegiances and compromise my thoughts to fit someone else ’s goals .   
I could put Amy out of mind , let the dust settle , mend and care for myself .
I hit the large group with the case they ’d withdrawn from the trunk of the car , bowling into people with the wretch only momentarily active .   
The incoming fire stopped- any miss would hit a friend of theirs , but they had other methods , including makeshift melee weapons .
I leveraged my fear aura , turned to outright shoves , flying knees to vital areas with no wind - up , and backhand strikes with my hand enclosed in a metal - braced glove .   
I fought through the tide of thralls , and if they might have found their footing and hit me back , those opportunities diminished to almost nothing as the fear aura slowed them down and gave them second thoughts .
They were thinker - one , tinker - one .   
Each gave up a lot to get access to that power .   
They were enemies of the city and enemies of Goddess .   
Were they here for us ?   
Had Goddess been right about them tracing the echoes or traces of her power to those affected ?
I hit a man hard enough he might have lost teeth .   
He might have been innocent , a regular man who ’d been promised power and paid too high a debt , losing all independence .   
I reached the box they had been carting .   
The Wretch emerged to strike at it , shattering wood .
The contents , as far as I could tell , were a long flat rectangle broken up into fragments , a sheet of exposed metal mesh .   
There were engines or generators , wires with exposed metal , and reams of extension cords-
enough electrical stuff overall that the box had required four people to carry .
I checked nobody was close enough , brought out the Wretch , and I smashed it .   
Whatever it was Teacher wanted to do here , I did n’t want to let him .
Smashing done , I turned away , flying to the nearest clearing , so I could survey the situation .   
The Wretch was still active , and as I moved , it dragged things in the dirt behind me .
It had taken up weapons- spears and twists of metal .   
It held them high , ready to stab and twist , bend and snap .
Worse , with people bowled over , there was nothing to deter people from shooting at me .   
They were realizing it , turning on me .   
This was too much offense , when I very much did not want to kill anyone Goddess did n’t want dead .
No , I needed defense .   
I took evasive action , casting off the Wretch , then resuming motion , so the scraps and twists of tinker technology    were left behind .   
Zig - zagging movements .   
Movements that went up , then down , then between feet that were planted far enough apart .
I dropped low , breastplate touching knee , and flew along the road .
I ’d done my part- and Byron was doing his .   
Water came in broad sprays , showering people , catching them at angles that hit faces , went under hoods , or caught bare legs and tights beneath shorts or skirts .
His water was normally cold , and in this weather , it was unforgiving .
I ’d destroyed one device , and Byron was apparently working to destroy another , repeatedly hitting a fallen box with torrents of water .
But the enemy- we ’d bowled them over , bruised , abused , battered them .   
They kept coming .
Goddess hit the point where she was frustrated with these guys .   
In the broad abstract , she needed our help if she was going to break up Teacher ’s growing hold on things .   
In the more micro - abstract , we were struggling with this dynamic .
“ They ’ve got teleporters !   
That ’s how they ’re getting people !
”
“
The door you destroyed !
”
I heard Withdrawal ’s voice , his accent .   
“
It ’s not the only one !
”
Door .   
It had been a door .
I had to fly up to get a proper view of the scene .   
Up twenty feet , pausing , with only a few momentary movements ,
in case someone was trying to draw a bead on me .   
I could see other boxes .
He could drop a teleportation gate into things , bring in an army , and win whatever fight he wanted .   
Some of those boxes did n’t look like teleporters .
We needed a path to retreat , and that was harder for Byron than it was for me .   
We needed to get the Malfunctions out of here .
The Malfunctions seemed to hear my thoughts , because I saw Withdrawal enter the fray .   
He moved at high speeds , skidding on wet and icy road , and hefted his syringe that was n’t a syringe anymore .
The contents of the syringe sprayed over a wall .   
He skated to it , then skated up the slick of spray .   
He bounded off of it , then landed smack - dab in the middle of a large group .
“ Bam .   
Bam .   
Bambam , zaap !
”
Finale .   
She used her blaster power to less effect than even the tinker - one ray guns and rifles .   
The air distorted in front of her hands every time she fired-
with more distortion each time .   
The ‘ zap’ was characterized by a distant sound of a whipcrack or thunder .   
Her mouth moved and she made sounds as she used her abilities , even though there should have been zero need .   
It put me in mind of people who could read , but who moved their lips as they did .
Caryatid was protecting Finale and Byron .    
She was a walking statue in black and amber , hands outstretched and pulled back , ready for a strike or grab if anyone got in range .   
Few did .
Finale dropped as she took a shot .
“
I ’m
okay !
”
she shouted , as she got back to her feet .   
She swung her arm like she was throwing a fastball , then threw a sphere of distorted air .
I hit the other guys a little harder , my intent on getting to and into the house before they could unpack one of those boxes and get her away .
I hit a door , knocking it off its hinges , and strode inside .   
The walls were the same as the exterior , in that they were prefabricated , too neat and tidy .   
The woman who lived here had painted them crimson .
In the large room I entered , I saw the woman who had to be the lady - friend of the head of the prison
’s medical .   
She was sweeping prescription pill bottles and bags of orange - yellow powder into a black trash bag .   
Multiple thralls jumped up from their seats to face my direction .
Drugs and some kind of ploy .   
Prescription medications and … something foreign .
I took it in , trying to commit details to memory , who had been where .   
I did that at the same time I advanced on the woman .
She was their prize , their target , that they were willing to lose ten to twenty thralls for .   
Injuries or separation would cost Teacher .   
My mother had always told me to take away their prizes .   
If we could n’t take them out and arrest them , we would leave them with no wins of their own .
The woman ran from me , and I flew after her , hands gripping corners to help me navigate the narrow spaces while airborne .   
She reached the front door- facing off to the side of our impromptu battlefield , and found the statue - form Caryatid standing on the other side .
Purple flames erupted in the woman ’s hands .   
She hurled them at the elegant statue - cape , and the statue burned .   
Caryatid ’s voice rose in alarm , then a prolonged cry of pain .
“
No !
” I shouted .
Cornered , unable to get past Caryatid in the moment , the woman wheeled on me , one hand gripping a black trash bag of loot , the other bearing purple flame that could burn the invulnerable .
“
I know your clairaudients can hear , Teacher .   
I want my reinforcements now .
”
She ’d had thirty , fifty people dropped in .   
Some had been capable- minor thinker powers , shooting accurately in the gloom .   
Others had been equipped .








Instinct : throw up my defenses to protect myself against this purple fire .   
Charge in , and remove the threat .   
Wrong move , putting myself in harm ’s way .   
If Caryatid could be hurt , then so could I , theoretically .   
I had to hold myself back .
Plan ?   
Taking a second to think things through , remind myself of key points and moves , accounting for things , they took time .   
It was time that she had to throw out some purple flame , setting the middle of the house ’s living room on fire .   
It bought her space , as she moved in the direction of the window .
I ’d come in through the side door , Caryatid through the front .   
The woman -pale and thin with thick - frame rectangular glasses
, the sides of her head shaved and her hair tied into a messy bun at the back- had her trash bag of drugs in one hand and fire in the other .   
Jeans , sneakers , and a purple t - shirt with some new metal band advertised on the front , their logo surrounded by flame .
Her head turned from the flames , where a motion of her hand made the swiftly dwindling fire grow , to the window .   
She ’d need hands free to haul it open .
In the heat of the moment , trying to consider my options , I turned to process , to follow the laws , and if that was n’t possible , to do what was right-
I looked over in Caryatid ’s direction .   
She ’d crumpled over , and she looked like she was alternately trying to stop , drop , and roll and be very still while the flames licked her costume and skin .   
The skin I could see at her hand looked angry and red , her other hand gripping her arm at the elbow .
“
Talk to me , Caryatid !
”
“ I ca n’t put it out !
”
My heart broke at the composed , stylish young woman sounding so unlike she ’d sounded .
I could circle the flame in the center of the room-
it was swiftly dwindling .   
Edging around , I could keep relatively the same distance from the woman with the purple flame-
She moved her hand , and the flame swelled violently , barring my path .
“
Let me-
”
She moved her hand again .   
The flame billowed out in a slow moving explosion , though an explosion was the wrong word .   
It was though a balloon was swiftly expanding in the center of the flame ’s mass , and the existing flame was forced to ride the surface , moving out as a wall with nothing beneath it .
“ -help her !
”
I was left to retreat , and I flew in the direction of an armchair .   
I hit it , Wretch - strength , and sent the chunks careening toward the woman .
But it was n’t really possible to aim it , and I did n’t score any direct hits .   
One chunk hit her bag .   
Another rolled through the flame .   
A dismissive move of her hand extinguished it .
My heart pounding , breath coming hard , frustration welling up inside me , I had to force my thoughts back on track .   
Not instinct – plan , logic , law .   
My train of thought from before .   
My impulses still shaped my thought process .   
The first place my thoughts went was to Goddess-
she was a ruler , she had a system of laws , and she had some idea of what she was doing , because one did n’t rule a universe without knowing something .   
She studied powers , too .
No use , though , because I did n’t have her on speed - dial , and I did n’t know what she would say or do .
The second place my thoughts kept getting caught on was the master - stranger protocols , because I ’d been thinking about them so recently .   
What was the law , the rule , the textbook way to do this ?   
Other protocols , other rules or by - the - books procedures .
This , for all intents and purposes , was a trump power , because it affected or involved other powers .   
Penetrating supposed invulnerability ?
S.O.P. for trumps was to get the hell out of dodge , reassess , and step carefully .
I heard a pained noise from Caryatid .   
The flames were re - igniting at her sleeve and shoulder , perilously close to her face .
“ Put out the flames , I ’ll let you go !
”
I called out .
Bag still in hand , back to the window , she tried to lift it .   
Ignoring me .
“
Listen to me !
”
I screamed the words .   
Then , in anger , lashing out in much the same way I might have struck her across the face with the back of my hand , I used my aura .
This time the fire exploded .
Purple flames became purple - white and blindingly bright , filling my vision in the course of filling the room .   
I threw up my forcefield on reflex alone , and my thoughts followed a moment later , with a stark awareness of why that was a bad idea .
The light that had washed over me became heat .   
As the glare faded , the heat remained .   
Even after being active for only a moment , I could see the vague profile of the Wretch , coming to pieces in dribbles akin to burning oil and scraps like flaming paper .
The woman across the room was busy extinguishing flames that had ignited curtains near her , not looking nearly as bothered by it as she should have been .
“ Caryatid !   
Are you okay ! ?
”
“ What happened ! ?
” still a voice without confidence , tremulous , small and afraid , like it belonged to someone years younger .   
Hearing it was almost enough to make me forget what I ’d needed to say .
“
Do n’t use your power !   
The fire ignites powers !
”
I saw the woman at the other end of the room react to that .   
That observation was blunted by the more pressing fact that I was on fire and I could feel the heat .   
My costume had absorbed the worst of it .
Get away , I thought .   
The rule for the powered dealing with trumps – especially the ones that screwed with powers .   
I had to fight my instinct to get away faster by flying .
I ran , feeling like a coward , feeling worse because Caryatid was still on the ground .   
Head low and face turned away from all hints of flame , my movements stumbling as I almost bounced off of a wall in my not - quite straight run down the hall .
Purple flames that licked me turned orange as I left the house .   
I spotted a puddle where road met a dip at the edge of a lawn , and threw myself at it .   
I chanced a use of my flight to get myself to the right angle , limiting the impact as I rolled into it .   
The coldness of the water and the wet corner of my hood slapping my cheek was a shock to the system .
A high whine caught my attention .   
I turned my head and saw a man in a white coveralls , a black jacket and black winter boots pointing a janky wires - and - kid’s - building - set gun at me .
I raised my defenses , and then remembered it had burned .   
What did that mean ?   
I started to fly away , and he shot me .
The forcefield took the hit , sparks flying from the point of impact , visible flashes of light traveling between raindrops like lightning .   
Before he could line up another shot , I changed direction , to one side , flipping around to be right - side up , a spark of light passing just to my left , and then , planting my toes on the ground to help arrest myself and give myself a physical point to orient myself around in space ,    flew into his legs , rising once he started tipping over .
The result was that as his feet went up , his face went down with that much more emphasis .   
He had the weapon in his hands , and he was unwilling enough to let go of it that he only used one hand to brace himself in the fall .
He failed utterly , and more or less met the ground face - first , landing with half of his body in the puddle .
The gun fired in the moment of impact , or out of some reflexive action , the spark hitting the edge of the lawn , conducting through the water , and making his body convulse and jerk- which included a spasmodic pull of the trigger .   
The spark hit the same spot , more or less , conducted into the puddle , conducting into him , which made his finger jerk-
I kicked the gun away before it could happen again .
I could hear more guns-
there were enough people around and the light was bad enough that I could n’t see who was aiming at what .   
I could see the glows and crackles of guns as they reached the point of being charged enough to fire , the faint illumination giving me some sense of where guns were pointed , but that only gave me a moment to react to each .
The woman with the purple fire was either inside or leaving the other end of the house .   
And as for Caryatid-
I flew up , and much like the woman with the purple fire had divided her attention between me and the window
, I was left to divide my attention between laser beams flicking through the sky and a barrage of wildly aimed white spark - balls that were each surrounded by nimbuses of electricity , as they conducted to nearby rain .   
A red flare jumped up from near a fence that one of Teacher ’s goons was using for cover , and I gave it a wide berth .   
It detonated like a firework .
I chanced a glance down , and I saw Caryatid outside , slumped over on the ground .   
I had to help her .
At the same time , the others were being overwhelmed by sheer numbers .   
Outnumbered ten to one , with the ten being armed .   
Withdrawal leaped from one ancient tree to the roof of a house so prefabricated it looked like a dollhouse .   
His stilt - feet skidded across the roof , cutting and dislodging shingles , followed a moment after by a raking of a thin blue laser beam and a few haphazard shots of brilliant white sparks , like the weapon of the guy I ’d just taken down .
I used my aura , primarily to distract .   
Heads turned , shots were altered last - second .
Those guns seemed to be firing at very steady intervals , roughly one shot every second and a half , and they did n’t run out of ammunition .   
Where they hit a target , they crackled outward , arcs lancing out to the nearest conductive target .   
It was one of these shots that hit the ground beneath Withdrawal ’s stilt - legs , then arced up to shock the metal there .
Once I recognized that there was a pattern , I could adjust .   
Earlier , I ’d had to dismiss instinct .   
Here , old sparring matches against my extended family came into play .   
There had been brief skirmishes against thugs who were willing to pull a real gun on a teenage girl in costume , and even an intense skirmish against Fenja had its relevance .   
As I ’d moved in time with her giant - sized weapon ’s swipes , I flew in general circles while I found the cadence here and they divided themselves by focus .   
Three people who had turned my way had those guns .   
Two of them were firing almost together , one firing out of sync with them , their spark - gun being bigger .   
A fourth had a laser gun , like the one that had produced the blue laser .
Two shots , change direction by going to their flank , change direction again to account for the adjustment of the third man , going up .   
The laser gun glowed blue as it charged up for the next shot .
Two shots , change direction , dropping down , account for the late shot from man number three by flying up and to the right .   
The laser beam fired , and it hit the Wretch .   
The Wretch was better at handling sustained damage than a single good hit .   
The beam burned out before the Wretch did .
I closed the distance , grabbing one of them by their hair .   
The movement of my arm reminded me that I ’d been burned-
my skin felt tight .
Fingers gripping hair and coverall - shoulder , the top of my foot hooking in between the man ’s legs , I strained my entire body and used my flight to fly him into his buddy .
My aura was affecting others , as I was flying closer .   
They turned , ready to complicate what I was doing .   
Withdrawal bounded over their heads , moving as if in slow motion , while his fluid spurted out over them and their heads .   
Guns fizzed and popped , and people fell , sprawling messily in the luminescent bubblegum pink stuff .   
One or two people who fell in the thicker patches of the spurt spun in place by some invisible force , their legs failing to find traction .
Someone shot at the ground just below Withdrawal ’s landing point .   
Arcs jumped up to his legs and out to nearby puddles .   
His suit failed to make the final movements that would secure his landing , and he landed hard , tumbling .
“ Bam , blast , zap , bam , bam and fuck you !
”
I could hear Finale .
The peppering of shots saw the one who ’d knocked Withdrawal out get knocked onto his own ass .
A brief appearance of blue motes and a splash of water that covered face and weapon saw the man convulse as his weapons’ energy discharged into his body .
“ I have to go get Caryatid !
”
I called out , as I spotted Byron .   
“
You good ! ?
”
“ Go !
”
“
Do n’t try to put out any purple flames with your power !
”
I called out .
He responded , but I was already too high up and far away to hear .
Moving across was dangerous .   
Adding a healthy dose of up to my plane of movement let me see more of what was going on , kind of , and it let me complicate things for those wanting to shoot me .   
People were not generally that good at hitting human - sized targets a hundred or two hundred feet away from them in the heat of the moment .   
I had one bullet wound that told me that there were exceptions to the rule , but I also had years of experience telling me that being airborne , mobile , and far away made me pretty darn safe in a firefight .
I flew up , looked , and saw Caryatid still on the ground .   
A few houses down the way , there were people in white standing around a contraption –
they were setting up a tinker device .   
The woman with the purple flame still glowing at one of her hands waited .
As fast as I ’d flown up , I flew down and at an angle , moving in more of a gentle arc than a straight line , to confuse anyone trying to target me .
I ’d been the one that had involved these guys .   
If any ended up seriously hurt , permanently hurt ?   
I swallowed hard as I dropped to Caryatid ’s side .
“
Did you get her ?
” she asked .
Costume burned .   
Her right hand and arm were charred black from fingertip to shoulder , the charred bits surrounded by red flesh-
No .   
The black was scraps of costume .   
I could see yellow where the voluminous inside of the sleeve had stuck behind .
She reached up with her burned arm and gave me a shake .   
“
Did you get her ?
”
“
She ’s out there .   
They ’re prepping a tinker thing .   
Maybe evac .
”
“
Can you get her ?
” I glanced over .   
“ I can try .
”
“ The others are okay ?
”
“ Withdrawal fell badly , but I think so .   
Outnumbered badly .
”
“ Then go !   
Get her !   
Or help them !   
Help me stand ?
” I got her arm over my shoulder , then straightened to a standing position .   
As we drew to a standing position , Caryatid was letting her breaker power creep over her .   
I could see the pattern by which it took over her hand and costume and made the two extensions of each other- the same pattern that the burn had traced .   
Residual heat had led to the more polyester - like fabrics clinging to skin .
Her body and arm remained utterly still , but her eyes urged me in the moment before her face dissolved into a morass of butterfly wing movements .   
Then even those movements went still , finer details becoming harder ridged structures , collapsing into a telescope - shaped structure .
I turned toward the yard where the woman and the squad had been .   
Caryatid ’s head oriented , the ‘ telescope’ narrowing to a cone , the point facing them , before almost immediately breaking apart .
“
They ’re making a door .
”
Their exit .
There were others arriving .   
Crackles of electricity , rectangular apertures framing silhouettes , and those silhouettes became people .   
More in coveralls , moving in fours and fives .
Different guns this time .   
These ones had bands of teal encircling them .
I took flight , using the same evasive maneuvers as before .   
Around me , I could see the beams of the teal cannons , if they could be called beams .   
They stabbed out , glowing and became rigid , transparent and luminescent , not unlike the hard light forcefields my family could create .
Each had spokes , or spurs , like thorns on vines or spikes on barbed wire .   
Where the beams were close enough to one another , spokes extended , moving around to connect to nearby beams or spokes with a force and suddenness that I could feel in the air , with sounds like whipcracks .
As more beams filled the air- the space between me and my target in particular , I saw my paths steadily closing .   
There were gaps I could have dropped an eighteen wheeler through broad - side out , but it was a huge unknown , made worse by the suspicion that this had been deployed as an anti - flyer method .
He ’s a tinker , I thought .   
The principles are the same .   
The toolbox that evolves to answer problems , the need for resources .   
The only thing that hold him back , like any tinker , are time and resources .   
He ’s had two years of time , and Goddess had enlightened us about his resource - acquisition .   
Valefor , Mama Mathers .   
Others .
Like most tinkers , he has them make resources that help them acquire or refine their resources .   
And because one key factor in this network or engine of his are people … he gets the hypnotist to help him get more people .
I flew in a course that put me over the ‘ side’ of the growing webwork of glowing teal beams and bars that seemed to stab off into the stratosphere .   
I had to get to that door before they slipped away .   
More beams appeared high above , beside , and below me .   
The cross - bars that connected them slammed out , connecting them all into the solid mass .
Was n’t doable .   
There had to be twelve of those assholes down there , firing in batteries .
I did n’t have any routes to travel that were n’t to the sources of the beams- something I was n’t sure would work , traveling in the opposite direction , far enough away that maybe the beams terminated or got far enough apart that there were n’t cross - beams , or fly for a gap .
The first and second options meant I was n’t flying down , to get to the woman with the purple fire or the group that was building the door , and they had their own flaws- the fact I was flying into dense webwork and the sheer lack of guarantee , respectively .
I flew for one of the gaps
I could have rolled an eighteen wheeler through .   
Wretch out .
Teal webwork flared around me as I approached .   
It shrank around me , breaking from the larger structure .   
A lasso , securing itself around the Wretch with enough force that the Wretch broke .
I slipped the noose in the same way that someone could escape a pursuer by shedding the jacket the pursuer had grabbed .   
Being smaller , freer , not caring about that which had broke .
But there were more gaps .   
I was forced to judge distances and timing .   
The Wretch took time to reappear , but it was n’t too long .   
So long as I timed it
so I was moving through a gap as it came back up
… I disconnected my mask from my belt , and I hurled it ahead of me and down , toward the center mass of the device and the people clustered around it .   
My hopes that the mask ’s passage would activate the lasso - closures and clear my way were dashed .   
It landed in the midst of the work they were doing , and heads turned my way .
The ‘ dash’ became the sequence of movements through that webwork , as more lines and bars of forcefield - webbing filled the sky between me and my targets .   
The Wretch was broken as soon as it re - emerged , and I had calls close enough that I nearly lost a boot as the webwork closed .
I was losing this battle , but I could get closer .
There had to be an opportunity .
The webwork steadily closed around me , and theoretically possible escape routes became impossibilities .   
My focus remained on staying clear , sticking to more open areas , where no lasso could close around me .
Far below and behind , Byron climbed over a fence , making his way in my direction .   
I pointed .
People on the ground seemed to report my action , or they ’d sensed Byron through the use of a power .   
The ones who were n’t actively setting up the door prepared to deal with him .
Too many for him to reasonably deal with .   
Even if he drenched every single one of them now , if every single gun failed because of the thorough drenching with water , I was n’t sure he ’d win .   
Thirty people , easily .
I saw the nervousness of the woman with the trash bag in her hand .   
She backed up , putting some distance between Byron and herself , while her people lined up at the fence .   
Blue motes began to collect in the air , which did n’t help matters .
Come on , come on , I thought .
Then I could n’t watch .   
More beams were flying in close , and I had to use the Wretch while throwing myself into the densest patch .    
The rectangles and triangles of empty space closed , paused for only an instant as they seized the wretch , giving me only a second to figure out which direction I was flying in .
I was literally upside down as I saw it- a flash of purple .   
Her hand drawn back , flame ready .   
Byron ’s arrangement of motes included the air above him .
The webwork snapped closed around my upper body and one of my ankles .
I pushed out with my aura , for maximum range .   
I was n’t sure the power mattered , but I gave that my all too .   
I squeezed my eyes shut .
The aura reached the woman and reached the flame she held .   
The aura ignited- the woman ’s fire spread across powers like flame across oil , and I ’d filled the space within a hundred feet of me with ambient power .   
Gas .
Aerosol .
Too much to hope for that it would hit this forcefield webbing and destroy it .   
Too much to hope for that it would destroy the door .   
It had staggered that group , and distracted a few by setting them on fire .
Two individuals were burning with purple fire and they did n’t move or react .   
Their stares were vacant .
Byron looked up at me .
“ Drench them !
” I hollered .
“ You said- !
”
I moved my arm .   
Another lasso was prompted to snap closed , seizing my arm in a position where it was over my head .
I hoped the gesture had worked .   
I drew in a breath to shout again , but he was already using his power .
Blue motes became the shape of the water and the lines became the courses that water was to travel .   
The water pressure was still lacking , but it was a lot of water , and the frozen ground did n’t want to absorb it .   
It sloshed over and through the fence , across ankles , feet , and into the work area where a doorway was being constructed .   
People were knocked over .   
The tinker work was left awry .
He looked up at me , and there was something in his body language .   
Defeat .   
There was something imploring .
I knew what he would ’ve asked , if he could ’ve done it safely , with the distance between us , or if that was n’t a consideration , what he would ’ve asked if he ’d been able to summon up the courage .
Right now , if he used his other power , and gave control to Tristan , that water would become stone .   
It would impact the device and it would trap most of the people there , the woman with the purple fire included .   
He wanted my permission , which was the opposite of the way this was supposed to work .
And then ?   
Tristan would help , we ’d have the evidence , go back to Goddess , and work out a game plan that worked for both Gimel and Shin .   
We ’d screw over Teacher and we would organize against him .
Yes , it would be a win .
Yes , it was workable long - term .
Yes , in service of the law , fighting the lawless , in what felt right , and in turning to someone else for help if we were struggling as we were , yes .
In service to that kernel of warmth in my heart when I thought about Dean and the classifications , when I thought about the black text printed on white paper , that detailed the rules to be followed , the chain of command in times of crisis ?
I shook my head , dramatically enough he could see .   
No .
I was reeled in , ice sloughing off where it had formed on the beams .   
In the course of my forced trip back , as I used flight to try to resist or change my course , more of the webbing snapped closed around me .   
Byron peeked over fence at the collection of people around the door , then reversed direction , heading for the source of the beams that had me .
I had nothing besides the vantage point that let me see the tinkers return to the door - shaped aperture they ’d constructed , with its generators , engines , and other tech built up around the base and the sides .   
There were shouts from the woman , as she looked over her shoulder .
Switches were thrown .   
Electricity crackled , and a shimmer appeared in the doorway , before promptly bleeding out to the surrounding area , through and into one of the generator - like machines at the base , causing it to detonate .
The electric portal energy bled out like watercolor , crackling loudly enough that I could n’t hear the people on the ground .
I pushed out with my aura .   
Nothing .
I could n’t even summon the Wretch without it being canceled as my bindings continued to entrap me .   
More of me was covered than not- only my head and neck were left clear .
There was a pause .   
Then the woman ran , nearly slipping on wet ice that covered the backyard of the house , and she leaped for the center of the blurry mass , disappearing within .
A moment later , the energy of the electric portal ignited violently .   
The fire traveled to the sub - systems and engines , and they began to explode .   
The thralls that had been working on it scrambled to get away .   
A few did n’t manage to , and were close as visible shockwaves rippled out , through and past them .
Discarded like they were nothing .
In the other direction , Byron was focusing on the guys with the teal web - beams .   
His motes began to form .   
Men and women backed up , holding their guns , with the almost flexible beams almost all together , stretching out toward me , forming a single line that drew me in .   
Only four were positioned with their guns resting on the ground , pointed skyward .
And behind ?   
There were still people from the earlier confrontation , though Caryatid , Finale , and Withdrawal were facing them down .
Fifteen or so left able - bodied in the yard with the now - destroyed and burning portal , ten or twelve as part of the group the Malfunctions were dealing with , Finale and Withdrawal crouched behind a slow moving Caryatid , and then the team of six with the anti - aircraft force - webbing .
Not just anti - aircraft force webbing .   
One of the guys on that team was reaching for another weapon at his ankle , one hand still propping up the larger weapon .
“
Careful !
” I shouted .   
“ Gun ! ”
Byron broke into a run , the crampons giving his feet bite on the icier patches of road .   
Blue motes became water , washing over that squad .   
A drenching of cold water , in the midst of freezing rain .
“ Bam ! ”
Finale shouted .   
One of the men staggered , where he ’d been finding his footing , and fell .
“ Finale !
” I shouted .   
“
If you ’re building up to something , now ’s the time !
”
“ I do n’t want to if-
”   
she started .   
Then she shrieked as a group that had been huddled behind cover burst out , opening fire .   
Caryatid was slow to move , but Finale was quick to put Caryatid between herself and the attackers .
Behind her , another group was emerging , weapons ready .
“
Behind !
”
I called out .
No place to take cover .   
Withdrawal shielded her with his body , empty syringe - gun held out like a shield .   
Both groups fired in concert , from opposite directions .
I used my aura , aiming to break up the rhythm .   
It affected Caryatid ’s group , but it affected the attackers too .   
More , if I had to guess .
“
What ’s the catch ! ?
”
I called out .
“
Do it , ” I could hear Withdrawal ’s voice , muffled around the edges .   
I ’d been reeled in enough that non - shouts were barely audible .
Byron , meanwhile , was dealing with the group .   
He was taking cover by the back end of a car .   
The group could n’t move much , so they were continually drenched .   
One of the guns had stopped working .
“ If there are any more-
” Finale said .   
“ I do n’t want to use my power if there are more coming .
”
“ There are n’t !
” I shouted .   
“
They got what they wanted !
”
She looked at me , eyes wide beneath her brimmed cap and behind her mask .
Byron ’s water took out the guy who was lassoing me .   
The gun fell to the ground , the beam twisted into a thousand loops like a badly kinked hose , and then winked out with a sound like a titan clapping his hands together a single time .
And Finale was doing her thing , wheeling on one group .
A blue light shone at one of the thrall ’s shoulders , then detonated with a musical intonation , like a gong being struck .   
He was thrown to one side , as was everyone in his immediate proximity .   
The movement was slower than it should have been , glittering particles surrounding them .
More lights shone , one after another , with a rhyme and reason that likely only made sense to Finale .
Another detonation , throwing people in another direction , toward the group that Byron was working on incapacitating .   
One of those people was illuminated with an imminent explosion .   
As the flying bodies drew into range , the detonation that was waiting for them came down , a higher sound , a faster roll - out , sending them the opposite way .
Juggling them .   
Herding them together , so people crashed into each other , were thrown into waiting explosions .
Not perfect- people fell free of the cascading effect , of detonations synced out to sound like a drum solo writ out in gongs , bells , and cymbals , complete with a soft destructive effect .
I flew down to take out one of the guys who had fallen free of the chain reaction , who was fleeing for cover .   
I kicked him to the ground and then landed on him with added force , before stepping on his hand and driving my weight down with my flight .   
My eyes roved for other strays .
It seemed Byron and Withdrawal had them .
The explosions were n’t true heat , fire , shockwave - that - liquefies - organs kind of detonation .   
They got sloppier toward the end , as more people fell free and some landed far enough away that their own detonations affected only them , making them flop once or twice like fish on dry land .
The metaphorical dust settled .
“ Patrol block is on its way , ” Byron said .   
“
Called them pretty early on .
”
“
Thanks , Capricorn , ” I said .    
That would complicate things with Goddess , but-
I kept my mouth shut .
“ I did n’t do that right , ” Finale said .   
“
I took too long to set up
and I did n’t finish it right .
”
“ You did good , ” I said .
“ I practiced on balls and sandbags , but humans fall in weird ways .
”
“ They absolutely do , ” I said .   
“
You did good .
”
She did n’t respond , to either agree or deny .   
Her teeth simply chattered .   
That would be adrenaline as much as the cold .
“ They got away ?
” Byron asked .
I nodded .   
“ The one did .
”
“ Shit , ” Withdrawal said .
On the ground , one of the people in white smiled .
I bent down over them , my eyes searching for anyone who was up to more fighting or attempted running .   
There were too many here .
“ Care to share with the class ?
”
I asked him .
The thrall shook his head .
“
Not worth it , ” Byron told me .
“ I know , ” I said .   
“
Brainwashed .
”
“ These guys are scary , ” Withdrawal said .   
He was more unsteady on his stilt - like limbs than before .   
One of his shoulders was venting a thin , steady stream of smoke .
“
Teacher ’s .   
He ’s a major player .   
The fact we made it through this unscathed is … it ’s going to have to be good enough .
”
“
I ’m going to call the team , ” Byron said .   
“ Is there anything I need to tell them ?
”
“ We ’ll have to figure out where the woman with the pills went .   
Maybe if we get the destroyed tech to Lookout ?
”
“
The woman from the house ?   
Our target ?
” Caryatid asked .   
She was still gripping her arm with one hand .   
Her skin looked red , even in the meager light .   
“
That ’s what she had in the bag ?
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
Can you remember who she was ?   
We gave you a list , and she was number-
”
“ Number two , ” Caryatid said .
My brain was so tired .   
I shook my head a bit .   
“
Can you remember her job ?
”
“ The prison pharmacist , ” Caryatid said .   
“ High risk because of her access and criminal history .
”
The serious look that Byron and I shared communicated a hell of a lot , but for the benefit of our novice Malfunctions , it needed to be said .
“
What if she was n’t taking those drugs out of the prison ?
” I asked .   
“
It ’s their overwhelming focus .
”
“ I ’ll call , ” Byron said , all seriousness .
Poisoned supply ?   
Something more sinister or obscure ?   
Whatever it was , it was serious enough that Teacher had been willing to sacrifice …
I looked around the neighborhood , still drenched in continuous freezing rain .   
People were looking out of windows and standing in open doors , now that it had all gone quiet , all rounded off with an explosive musical solo .
Easily forty thralls that had n’t slipped away or escaped by some other means .








“ Reality is on fire , ” Jester said it in a very matter of fact way , before adding ,    “ purple fire .
”
“ Is it spreading ?
” I asked .
He shook his head .   
“ Shrinking , but slowly , and it looks ominous .
”
“
It ’s around the door thing ?
”
“ Is that what that was ?   
A door ?   
Yeah , it ’s mostly around some tech stuff at the base .
”
“
Then it ’s fine .   
Get people to stand back , in case it blows .
”
“ We already did , ” Jester said .   
He did n’t move from his spot underneath the shelter of the bus stop .
The street was now crowded with police cars that did n’t match each other , Jester ’s patrol bus , and two ambulances .   
My hand was bandaged , and the Malfunctions were being looked after .   
The patrol had done its work , and Jester was keeping me company , under the guise of getting updates on the situation .   
That had taken two minutes , really , he ’d stepped away to report to others , and he ’d just come back .
As for the rest-
it was only in the wake of the event that I could really take stock of just how much of a battlefield
this neighborhood had become in a very short span of time .   
There were a lot of combatants , disabled or otherwise not putting up a fight , who were being put in the patrol bus .
“
Are you okay ?   
Really okay ?
”
Jester asked me .   
“
I know we ’re not close , and that ’s a very personal question , but
… ” “
We worked together .
”
“ For a bit over a year , and even this week , I was going into work and thinking I could bug you about some power classification thing or something I saw online .   
I forget what .
”
“ You miss me ?
”
I asked , raising an eyebrow .
He shrugged , shoulders straining against the straps of his vest- the stripped - down PRT armor with the identifying marks scraped off .   
In the cold weather , he was wearing a jacket over the vest .   
His tattoo was n’t visible beneath the long sleeves .
“ I kind of miss you guys too ,
” I said .
“
That ’s a very nice generic , ‘ you guys’ .   
A deft deflection from saying you miss me in particular , Miss Dallon .
” I smiled .
“ Is that your way of saying you ’re not okay ?   
You miss when things were simpler ?
” he asked .   
“
Because holy shit , um , I told Gil to wake me up or pull me in if your team ever needs anything , and I keep getting brought in for really messed up shit .
”
“ You do n’t have to , ” I said .
“ I like it !   
Do n’t get me wrong .   
Not the messed up stuff- ”
“
You ’re losing me .   
You like it
but you do n’t like it ?
”
“ I like you , ” he said , before his eyes registered the words , and he gave a fraction - of - a - second - late , “ -guys .
”
“
Deft . ”
He spoke with more energy and verve , as if he could stampede all over that exchange , leaving it behind him .   
“
I did this whole Patrol thing because powers kick ass
and I thought if I did n’t have powers , I could still be the guy in uniform that the big goddamn hero turns to and says , ‘
Hey , guy with the cool callsign , are you going to have our backs?’
and I could say yes .
”
“
Cool callsign , huh ?   
That ’s an integral part of this fantasy ?
”
“
It ’s not a fantasy .   
It ’s a mission .   
I ’m going to become an instructor and team leader one day , and it ’ll be mandatory .   
No gun until you have a decent nick .   
Exceptions if you have a badass last name and you go by that name .
”
“ I feel sorry for your students .
”
“
Quiet , you , ” he said .
Another patrol bus drove up .   
Jester raised his hand , and behind the glare of the headlights and the windshield with ice at the edges , the driver raised    a hand in response .
I punched Jester in the arm .   
“
Thanks .   
For backing us up .   
You were there at the Fallen thing , you were there for Swansong .
”
“
You ’re welcome , ” Jester said .   
“
It ’s nothing big .   
Trying to help out when I can , help the people who are doing the big stuff … like tearing through seventy - five jerks with tinker guns .
”
He indicated the neighborhood street .   
The road was low quality beneath puddles and ice , already cracking less than a year after it had been laid down , and the wet surface reflected the flashing blue and red light of emergency vehicles .
“ Fifty at most ,
” I said .
“
How ’s Swansong ?
” he asked .
I raised my eyebrows .
“
I guarded her , kept watch , like you said .   
Spent enough time doing it
I ’m invested , and she ’s cool .
”
I had no idea how she was .   
The question was enough to get me to check my phone for any status updates .
“
I ’m going to see her shortly , ” I spoke slowly as I scrolled .   
“
Last I heard ,
yeah ,
she was okay .   
But with everything going on-
” I stopped myself .
“
She ’s in prison , though .   
How would she be involved ?
”
Damn it , Jester , why did you catch on to that ?
“
Nah .   
She feels like her hands are tied , ” I covered .   
“
And that ’s hard .
” Jester nodded .
Byron was at the periphery .   
A cop had stopped him , but a moment later , was calling out to someone else .   
Getting backup , since it was no doubt intimidating to have a guy in armor show up at the edge of the battlefield .
“ I should go , ” I said .   
“
Good luck with dealing with that patch of reality being on fire .
”
“
It ’s really cool , if you have n’t seen .   
It ’s like if they froze lightning and then set it on fire .
”
“ I got a close - up taste of it , ” I said , raising my hand , where I ’d pulled my glove on over bandages , the bandages peeking out the end , and tapped the bandage .   
“
And you guys should keep your distance until it burns out , to be safe .
”
“ We will .
”
I headed in Byron ’s direction .   
He was still held up with police , but they did n’t seem as bothered .   
He indicated me , and I gave them a wave and thumbs - up .
The Major Malfunctions broke away from the paramedics , hurrying to my side .   
I paused , letting them catch up , while keeping an eye on Byron to make sure he was alright .
“
Are you going after the pharmacist ?
”
Withdrawal asked .
“
Not sure yet .   
We ’re rendezvousing with the rest of the team .   
Once we know what we ’re doing , we ’ll be in touch with everyone .   
You guys should rest , resupply ,
if you feel like you ’re done , that ’s perfectly okay .   
If not , let us know that you ’re game , and we ’ll let you know as soon as we know more .
”
“
I ’m out of accelerant , ” Withdrawal said .   
“
And my exoskeleton took a beating .
”
“
It should be go - goo or speedslime or something , ” Finale murmured .   
“
And if you ’re going to call it that , your suit should be a go - suit .
”
I had the impression this was a discussion they ’d had before .
“ You guys are battered , burned , and bruised .   
You did more than your fair share-
you did great .   
I totally did not mean to get you involved in something that intense .   
If you want to sit out , I will absolutely not think less of you for it .
”
“ I was gon na say , ” Withdrawal said .   
“ Accelerant is gone , Finale is spent , and Caryatid got burned- ”
“
It ’s not a big deal , ” Caryatid said .   
“ Antares got burned too .
”
“
-and , ” Withdrawal pressed on , voice muffled by mask , insistent as he fought against getting sidetracked , “
I think I speak for everyone when I say we found out
the pharmacist was up to something , we started this , and it would be satisfying to be involved when it wraps up .   
I want to get her .
”
“
Yes , ” Caryatid said .
I looked at Finale .
“ I want what they want , ” she mumbled , evading eye contact .
“ Sit back , recover , reload your slime , heal .   
We will be in touch , ” I said .   
“ We have to step carefully when it involves the prison .   
They ’re wary of us , and they wo n’t believe us if we try convincing them that their staff member is a problem .
”
“ Alright , ” Withdrawal said , his head turning , attention between Finale and me .   
I saw him take a deep breath , halfway through which he seemed to notice something about the frame he was wearing
, his hand going to one shoulder to touch the metal there .   
It stayed there as he exhaled .   
“
We ’ll hang back for now .   
Thanks .
”
I could see the tension release in Finale ’s shoulders .
“
Thank you , ” I said .
Byron opened the car door as I approached .   
He ’d apparently fended off the police .   
I waved for him to get back in , glancing at the cops to make sure he had n’t complicated things by setting them against Goddess .
“
Did n’t you get permission to take the box ?
” he asked .
“
Yeah .   
I ’ll get it .
”
“
It ’s heavy , and you ’re injured , ” he said .   
“ I ’ll help .
”
I wanted to protest .   
I shut my mouth .   
Master - stranger protocols .   
They did n’t really apply here , since this had nothing to do with Goddess , but maybe it was better to get used to letting him give the orders .
The box was roughly the size of a coffin , and it did take the both of us to get it into the trunk , the back seats folded down .   
Byron slammed the back closed .
“
No injuries ?
” I asked .
“ Benefit of being long - ranged .   
I got zapped a few times , nothing too bad .   
Weak guns .
”
“
Nonlethal , ”
I said , my voice quieter .   
“ Just about all of it , as far as I could tell .   
Pharmacist excepted .   
I think it might be part of how they get recruits , now .
”
Byron ’s breath fogged , a lingering aftermath of a sharp , sudden exhalation .   
A swear expressed unspoken .
I did n’t miss the sideways look he gave me .   
His train of thought was easy enough to follow .   
Recruits .   
Altered mental states .   
‘ Quote - Brainwashing - unquote’ .
The second patrol bus was picking up the wounded and disabled .   
It had come stocked with blankets , tending to those who ’d been splashed or left lying against cold ground .   
The thralls did n’t fight or argue much .
“
Thanks for having my back , ” I said .
“ I felt stuck , looking after the Majors , I saw you needed help , but getting there was tough .
”
“
It ’s fine , ” I said .   
“
He ’s …
he has an answer to anything , and I was the threat that stuck out .   
They brought out the anti - air brute - binding measure , that ’s on me .   
I could have been more strategic .   
We ’ll figure something out .   
We have other teams , we have Goddess …
”
“
And-
” Byron started .   
“ Sit with me ?   
I wo n’t go fast .   
We ’re not rushing .
” I nodded .
We both climbed into the car , and I was glad for the warmth that was blowing in noisily from the fans .   
Byron had to work a bit to get in , with the weight and less comfortable aspects of having armor on .   
For me , it was just the breastplate , and I could use my unburned hand to loosen it .
“
We have an issue , ” Byron said , as he pulled the car around in a u - turn .   
“
It means things might not go that smoothly .
”
“
The changing powers ?
” I guessed .   
“
The ebb and flow between you two is n’t favoring you as much .
”
“
Not that , ” Byron said .   
We were approaching a turn , and he turned to look over one shoulder .   
“ Is my left side clear ?   
Wearing a helmet while driving is not good for the peripheral vision .
”
I twisted around to look .   
“ Clear . ”
He turned , moving more slowly than usual .   
More emergency vehicles were coming in the opposite direction , heading to the site we ’d just left .
“ Tristan and I made arrangements .   
I ’m getting calls .   
They ’re impatient , and Tristan did n’t pick them because they were easygoing .
”
I could hear the friction of Byron ’s glove on the material of the steering wheel as he gripped it tighter .
“
The people from Lord of Loss’ territory ?
”
“
Ah , you caught that .
” When we ’d gone to the other Earth to track down the Fallen sypmpathizers from Cheit , there had been a group of people who Tristan had paid attention to .   
They were in Lord of Loss and Marquis’ orbit , which suggested things .
Professional , off the grid .
“
Hit men ?
” I asked .
“ Is there a term for people worse than hit men ?
”
“
How does that work ?   
Hit men are generally pretty bad , they ’re professional , they ’re about as criminal as you get .   
How do you get more extreme than that ?
”
“ They do n’t kill , ” Byron said .
I set my jaw .   
Too many complicated thoughts were stirred up by that line of thinking .   
My first , almost hopeful thought was that he meant they were worse as in less - effective .   
The summary thoughts led me down a trail that made me think about my sister .
“
An end worse than death , ” Byron clarified , unhelpfully .
“ I got it , ” I said , my voice tense .
The car
’s tires cut through the wet , icy roads .   
It was far from being good hero transportation .   
Only the fact that license plates did n’t mean anything kept it somewhat anonymous .   
If anyone cared to pay attention , it ’d be a problem .
Fates worse than death .   
As an idea , it was too close , too fresh .
Fuck , my burned hand hurt .
“ Why in the upside - down fuck would you pick people worse than hit men ?
” I asked .
“ I did n’t , ” Byron said .
“
It was Tristan ?
”
“
He decided on it and moved forward .   
He does this thing where things get bad , and he sees a possible solution-
he gets all gung - ho for it .
”
“
So he hires a fate - worse - than - death hitman ?
”
“
He said it was extreme enough that he ’d have to stay in line .   
I was witness to it , as I am to all things Tristan .   
Then it was done with .
”
“
And you ’re okay with that ?
”
“ I ’m resigned to it , ” Byron said .   
“
It happened , and by the time I wrapped my mind around it and did my own research , it was done .   
Too hard to revoke , and things were better .   
They were almost good for the first time in years .
”
“
Things go wrong , Byron .   
This exact situation , it ’s one of those things .
”
“ I know .
”
“
What the hell are the particulars , here ?   
Who are these guys ?
”
“ Barcode .   
Most of the time they deal in death .   
But they have contacts , the sort of people who might be out in one of Marquis’ cabins in the middle of nowhere , not wanting to be bothered .   
I do n’t know for sure where those contacts are , though .
”
“
And ?
”
“
And one of those is a striker .   
A dealer in human parts .   
They take people apart with physical blows as if they ’re dolls .   
Takes an arm and a leg , literally , takes kidneys , hearts , genitals , whatever people are willing or desperate to buy .
”
“
No , ” I said .
“ If one of us steps out of line or try to game the system , he makes being swapped in just as miserable or worse than being inside- ” “ No , Byron .   
Just- stop ?   
Please .   
No details .
”
“ Mm .
”
The car sped along a road , down a street that , even with the periodic streetlight , was mostly too dark to see .   
The city was n’t that bright around us , with lights in windows easily confused with the light catching on the edges of raindrops and flecks of frost .
“
What ’s the procedure ?
” I asked .   
“
Forget the consequence-
it ’s bad .   
I get it .   
How do you do it ?
”
“
We meet up every few days .   
We confirm we ’re okay , we swap .   
There are two or three people who show up , sometimes with backup , whoever they ’re working with at the time .   
One is usually a thinker .   
They can read people .   
Read us .
”
My phone lit up , brighter in my lap than any light outside or on the dash .   
It was Lookout .   
They were close to our destination .
“ They read people .   
For altered mental states ?
”
“
Yep .   
Drugs .   
Amnesia .   
Brainwashing .
”
He put emphasis on that last point .
“
So you would go .   
You ’d swap over to Tristan-
”
“
And whether he cooperates or not , he ’s under her influence .   
They come after me .
”
I closed my eyes .   
“
What if the thinker does n’t show ?
”
“
And Tristan does n’t sound the alarm ?   
There ’s no guarantee he switches back to me , for one thing .
”
“ And the deadline ?
”
“
Last night , ” Byron spoke in the kind of monotone reserved for those trying very hard to keep their voices level .   
At my look of surprise , he elaborated , “ We had the TV show .   
They were willing to delay .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .
“ Tight time limit , ” Byron said , and his voice was tense .   
“
I can maybe fend them off for tonight , we did say we were busy .   
I ’ve been thinking about other options since after you and I had our skirmish .
”
It was hard to think of the skirmish and not find the doubts welling
, my mind immediately going to the perspective of how Byron was a problem first .   
The protocols did n’t jump immediately to mind .
“
How did he even find these guys ?
”
“
Ha , ” Byron said the word , humorless .   
The car swerved a bit on what looked like normal , not - icy ground , and he corrected .   
“
I saw it happen
and I do n’t even know .   
I smile and
it ’s …
it ’s an expression .   
He smiles and people like him .   
He gets online and finds people we used to fight , people we threw in jail , asks how they ’re doing , finds common ground in the world ending , fishes .   
A couple weeks later , somehow he has these guys , with a clandestine system for getting in touch .   
I did n’t even think it would happen , so I just let him do his thing , focused on my own things , and … surprise , it all came together , am I willing to shell out some of my own cash
so it ’s not one party paying the scary mercenaries ?   
I should know not to underestimate him when he sets his mind to something .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .   
“
Then we have a time limit .   
Goddess , prison , pharmacist , make sure Rain and Ashley are okay .   
Tonight ?
”
“
Tonight , yeah .   
All of that tonight .   
Then if we ca n’t fix it by then , you ’re going to need to put me into a coma .   
Say I was hurt in the field .
”
“ If they have that thinker , and if I ’m actually brainwashed , then they ’ll catch on .
”
“
A neutral third party then , ” Byron said .
“
And we lose our one unaffected person in the chain of command for the master - stranger protocol .
”
“
Yeah .
”
I folded my arms , being careful with my burned hand , and stared out the window , thinking .   
I had to anticipate what the others would say and do
, I had to second - guess Byron while at the same time supporting him , and I needed to think about Teacher and his motives and goals .   
Even simpler things were made that much more problematic by the things in their orbit , like Amy ’s proximity to Goddess .
We drove in silence .   
There was no radio , and our only soundtrack was the noise of the wheels through wet ice and the patter against the car roof .   
I ’d spent relatively little time in cars and vehicles for the past seven or so years , even during my stint with the patrol block , and my awareness of the individual noises was harder to block out .
Not that I minded .   
White noise was a good grounding for contemplation , and the sounds were alien enough that I was n’t reminded of anything particular .
I checked my phone and found it marked with the ‘ no service’ icon .   
No internet waypoints , no cell .
I wanted to have neat and tidy answers and excuses like I had with Kenzie before we ’d left , where I ’d been able to keep her from going off and doing her thing to try and be helpful .   
Or so I was hoping .   
I did n’t have much of anything .
That left the battle plan .   
In twisting ideas around in my head , trying to think of how we might help Goddess in a way that Byron might approve of , or deal with a prison with a massive red button , where our enemy could run roughshod and we could n’t …
It was all backward .
All backward .
The most un - superhero hatchback found its parking space at the desolate parking garage .   
Natalie ’s bug was already parked in a spot .   
It was startling , on a level , to recognize how small that car was , that Natalie had to be the person driving it , and the rest of the team had fit in it .
The answer , of course , was that two of our members were in jail .   
A third was in Goddess’ company , no doubt enjoying how very simple and clear life was .
We were seven , eight if we included our tertiary member Natalie .   
Three were gone .   
That left three for the car , Byron and myself .
Capricorn and I got out of the car .   
The others were waiting .   
Natalie was fidgeting , her eyes wide .
Was it a good thing or a bad thing that they had n’t been able to keep her in the dark ?
“
Swansong and Precipice are sitting out .   
No holograms for right now .   
They ’re more focused on immediate happenings in the prison , ” Sveta said .
“ Sounds good , ” I said .
“
Can I see the tech ?
”
Lookout asked .
“
Sure .   
As soon as we unload it .   
Can you give us a hand , Nat ?
”
Capricorn asked , popping the trunk open .
I saw Natalie studying us , wary like she thought I ’d suddenly grab her or something .   
I saw Sveta studying Capricorn in particular , suspicious .   
Still , Natalie helped , and we slid the box out of the back of the car and down to the floor of the parking garage .   
Sveta snatched up a few things on the ground that we might have tripped on .
The lights of the garage were only half - illuminated , and the half that were illuminated were dim , the glows orange and diffuse .   
There were n’t many cars , and the cars looked like they had been there for a while , with rust and dust creeping over their exteriors .   
For a couple , it looked like people might have been living in them .
“
So cool , ” Lookout said .   
“
It ’s not every day that I get to look at a tinker
’s stuff .
”
“
There ’s a time limit , ” I said .   
“ If we move , we need to move tonight .
”
“ I remember you guys talking about not wanting to overwork K- Lookout , ” Natalie said .
Still wary , even as she protested .
“
I ’m conserving my energy for the times and nights when it really matters and my talents are needed , ” Lookout said , kneeling beside the now - open box .   
“
And everything ’s intact !
”
“
I smashed one box , ” I said .   
“ They unpacked and activated one .   
This was one of two others .
” Natalie looked downright desperate to figure out what was going on , suppressed alarm clear on her face .   
She could n’t ask , though , not without signifying that something was wrong .
“
We ’re going forward with Chris ’s disconnected cells idea , ” Sveta said .
I approached her , reaching out .   
She put her hand in mine , and I gave it a waggle .
Tension across her face seemed to ease slightly with that .   
The smaller signs of anxiety like free tendrils finding their perch or the rustle of movement inside her shell of a body were muted in a similar way .
“
Disconnected cells , ” I echoed , confirming I ’d heard .
“
She has two other groups .   
We ’ll move in coordination once we know for sure what we ’re doing .
”
Natalie touched her phone , which was in her jacket pocket .   
The layers she wore seemed overly warm for even this shitty weather , but I could see that she ’d gone easy on the top beneath the sweatshirt and jacket .   
No doubt choosing clothes that did n’t press on her cut .
She did n’t draw out the phone , though , or tamper with it in a way that made me think she ’d opened a call to emergency services , holding a button too long or tapping one area of the screen while the phone was still in a pocket .
I let myself relax .
“
What ’s the verdict ?
” I asked .
“
Still studying it , but … ”
Lookout pulled out her phone , held it out , and clicked a button .   
A little square robot face with hearts for eyes pirouetted across the screen , providing the object of focus for a side - wipe screen transition .   
What was left in its wake was gibberish data .   
“ Portal to another world , obviously .   
You mentioned that already , over the phone .
” I nodded .   
I was hyperaware of everyone ’s state at this point .   
Natalie ’s anxiety was creeping up .   
Capricorn was quiet , lost in thought .   
Lookout was lost in her work , naturally .   
And Sveta …
She did n’t look like she was wholly in control of herself .   
More tendrils snaked out here and there , finding gaps and crevices , or old damage .   
They were n’t the long tendrils-
those were managed .   
It was only the shortest , narrowest ones .
It sucked that she could accept the hand - waggle , but she gave me a look with doubt in her eyes when she did n’t think I was paying attention .
Lookout was humming .   
“ Hmm .   
Okay .   
Can you get my laptop ?   
Oh , and the projector disc .   
I ’ll image it .
”
I got the computer .   
Kenzie tinkered , plugging projector disc and phone into the laptop , while holding the phone out near the door in a box .
“ I ca n’t get the teleporter working , I do n’t think , ” Lookout said .   
The bun - encasement at the back of her head opened up , making eye contact with me , while she hunched over her work .   
“
But I know space and coordinates , and these things were made with coordinates built in .
”
It took three tries before it worked-
a three - dimensional map , incomplete , with some rooms and areas simply in blocked - out estimations of building dimensions , other areas hyperdetailed .   
The route we ’d traveled was as clear as day .
“ There .
” Everything about the three - dimensional replication was cast aside as the image zoomed in on the pharmacist ’s destination point .   
The image was supplemented by more rectangles that had video feeds .
“
This is pretty awful work , ” Lookout said .
“
It looks good , ”
I replied , but I was lost in my observations .   
The pharmacist was in the room I had to assume was the pharmacy .   
The black trash bag was emptied , pill bottles put on a shelf with other bottles .   
I pointed at her .
“
Can we get video of the area when she would have been leaving the scene ?
” Capricorn asked .
“
Maybe .   
I use the cell networks , and they ’re hinky right now .   
Some of this is old or out of sync .
”
“
Is that accident or intention ?
”
Capricorn asked .   
“
The towers being down ?
”
“
I do n’t know , ”
Lookout replied , even though I suspected he had n’t really been asking for her verdict .
What is the pharmacist doing , and how does it factor into Teacher ’s agenda ?
“
Can you get eyes on security , while you ’re at it ?
” I asked .   
“
I ’m curious
who was watching the monitors when a woman with punk hair and a purple metal shirt waltzed through a door made of lightning .
”
“
On it .
”
Natalie shifted her weight from foot to foot .
Capricorn checked his phone , which was gripped in one gloved hand .   
“ Feeling the time limit .
”
Another call from the guys ?
“
Working as fast as I can , ” Lookout said .
There .   
It hitched and glitched here and there , but the image split into two rectangular screens .   
In one , the electrical door appeared .   
The pharmacist came through with the latter portion of a leap .   
In the other , we had a view of one of the security guards reach out and change the image on the screen away from the violently flickering image .
“
We want to know who he is , ” Capricorn said .
“
Already on it .
”
I got to watch the pharmacist get settled , torch the portal from her end of it , and then set to work , pulling things from the bag and organizing them in a painstaking way … then getting the baggie of orange-
I presumed orange because the image was n’t great enough quality to contrast the warm colors and it was close - powder .
That was the main attraction in our little theater here , enacted in a neutral location that put us closer to the portal .   
On the sidelines , Lookout ’s system was pulling out schedules and images .   
We had one pharmacist and one security guard confirmed as Thralls
– or whatever it was when they were n’t outright brainwashed .
It was like dominoes falling .   
Security guard confirmed compromised .   
Schedule came up , as did address .   
Then there were the images , from prison video , from online , and from traffic lights that recorded those who passed through intersections .   
On a map , routes he regularly traveled were highlighted .
From that guy , another guy , tracking destinations and more , the system clearly inferred other moles in the prison staff .   
As portraits lined up , they became brighter or darker as new information came to light .
“ Victoria ?   
Can I talk with you ?
” Natalie asked .
Right fucking now ?   
The dominoes are falling .   
We ’re getting a sense of what we ’re fighting here .
“
Can you give me a minute ?
” I asked .
“
I ’m kind of freaking out .
”
“
Okay .   
As soon as we make sure everyone is contributing .   
Tress , try to communicate to Precipice and Swansong that they should absolutely not take their medication of the day .   
We still do n’t know what that woman is doing .   
Lookout , where are you at ?
”
“ I do n’t know .   
I ’m trying to figure out this door .   
I might be able to open it , but it ’s going to mean taking this stuff back to my workshop , where I was fiddling with the teleporter project .   
I can kludge them together and give us a way to move to where the woman with the purple shirt went .
”
“ How long ?
”
Capricorn asked .   
Byron was concerned about the time .
“
Four , five hours ?   
Closer to four if I have someone helping .
” I looked at Capricorn .   
We could n’t afford four or five hours .
“
No .   
We ’ll go with another tack .   
We do this backwards .
”
“ Backwards ?
” Sveta asked .
“ Cryptid thinks Teacher ’s plan is to get them to close off access to that world .   
If Goddess is baited into going in there
and they close the gate behind her , or worse , catch her between realities .
”
“ Why do you- ?
” Natalie started .   
She stopped as Capricorn moved slightly .   
A nudge or small wave , easily missed .
For all that he ’d talked about his brother , he did
okay when it came to convincing others .
I went on ,
“ If he closes off that reality , especially with another person at the helm , then he can raid it continually , gathering thralls at his leisure .   
So let ’s get ahead of him , start from his win condition .
”
“
That sounds like a thing your mom would say , ” Natalie murmured .   
Her earlier insistence on talking to me was forgotten .   
She had stars in her eyes as emotions that clearly mingled with the worried curiosity , the fixed stares , and the nervousness .
“
It very much is , ”
I said , agreeing .   
“ If they ’re running with cash in hand , take that cash .   
At best , if we can do that , we force a draw .   
Teacher wants to lock off the area and loot it ?   
We beat him to the punch and close it off first .
”
I looked Lookout
’s way as I finished saying that .
“
Do you want me to rig that ?
” she asked .
“
Can you ?   
Use the data you have from that door , and figure out a way to scramble coordinates so they do n’t let people in , or so they do n’t let people out ?
”
“ I can make it so they ca n’t leave , ” Lookout said .
“ Perfect , ” I said , smiling .   
As an option , it fit with timeframes Byron had outlined , and it helped to sway an otherwise untenable situation to our favor .
It made a kind of sense that Lookout ’s toolkit would point in that direction .   
It was easier to destroy or distort than it was to create .   
Here , in the midst of it all , when so many other things were tainted with doubts and small betrayals , it was good to know that we could potentially be the ones with the keys .
It made too much sense .   
I was n’t supposed to be following my instincts like this .   
I had to stop myself , and look to Byron .
“
Yes , ” he said .   
“ Sealing him in there or sealing him away will be very good plays , if timed right .   
For now , we should inform the other teams we were talking to , see if anyone can do something about the bombs that are strapped to our teammates’ ankles , and while we ’re doing it , we should be very , very careful to keep the cells discrete .
”
Keep them away from Goddess ?
“
What about the medication ?
” Sveta asked .   
“
I think they give those out around mealtimes , and as dark as it is outside-
”
“
It ’s only the evening now , ” I finished .   
“ Meals are n’t that far off .
”
“
Do we roll the dice ?
” Capricorn asked .   
“
We have some sense of who is compromised .   
If we reach out to prison staff and get them to stall-
”
It was n’t so easy as that .   
Too risky .
I shook my head , and he did n’t press for it .
“
We tap other sources for help , we see what they have to say , and we see if they ’re game for this , ” I suggested .   
“
Bigger powers .   
Maybe ones that can disable the bomb threat .
”
“
The Wardens ? ”
Natalie asked .








“ I ’m going to need fifty different explanations , ” Natalie ’s eyes were wide .   
“ Goddess ?
”
“
It ’s complicated , ” I said .   
“
And it ’s not really a question of the law , exactly .   
I-
”
“ I think Natalie should be heard , ” Byron cut in , his voice firm .
Master - stranger .   
If she was untainted … did she qualify as the next person in the chain , should Byron be occupied ?   
There was a possibility that we ’d have to put him in a coma or something like it if we could n’t get all of this handled by tonight .   
Did that mean Natalie would be taking point , somehow ?   
What would that even look like ?
“ Natalie , ” Sveta said .   
“
We owe you a lot for looking after Kenzie .
”
“
Mm hmm , ” Kenzie made an affirmative sound .
“
But Victoria ’s right .   
This is complicated .   
Before Victoria and Byron left to check on the Majors , Byron attacked her .   
We ’re really only letting it slide because she has the strength to keep him in line , and I ’m not
that convinced it ’s right to do that .
”
“
That ’s not entirely accurate , ” Byron said .
“ Um , ” Natalie said .   
“
I can mediate , then .   
But I need more information .
”
“
No , ” Sveta said .
“
Yes , ” I countered .   
It was n’t easy to do , to go against every instinct and rational thought and put something forward .
Sveta turned , her expression hardening .   
Harder still to see that .   
My friend .
“
We lose nothing by doing it , ” I said .
“ We lose time .   
Teacher is making his moves and we ’re two steps behind .   
The woman on the screen right there is preparing drugs for reasons we do n’t know .   
We ca n’t take time to catch someone up when they ’re about to be distributed , and we definitely ca n’t fracture the team and let things go to pieces with infighting !
”
“
Kenzie ’s
work wo n’t be instantaneous .   
It ’s worth bringing more trusted people in , giving them information , and letting them have a voice .
”
“ I do n’t trust them !
”
Sveta retorted .   
“
I ’m sorry .   
I ’m really sorry ,
I ’m grateful for what you two do , Byron , Natalie , for what you three do , if I include you , Victoria .   
But I feel like conversations are happening in the background , like you guys talked a lot while I was stuck here , and I do n’t like the direction things are going .   
It feels wrong .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
I glanced at Kenzie .   
She was behind Sveta , hugging one knee against her chest , the other dangling , a small smile on her face .
“
I was trying to figure it out , ” Sveta said .   
“
And the only thing that makes sense to me is if Byron drugged you while you were dealing with him .
”
“
Drugs do n’t work that way , ” I said .   
“
Kenzie would have video of him applying the drugs .
”
“ I would , I do .
”
“
Something in the water ?
”
Sveta tried , almost plaintive .   
“
His power has changed before , and with things this warped …
it ’s not impossible that it ’s not pure water , now .
”
“
It ’s a bit of a reach , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I think simpler drugs are more likely .   
I can check my video .
”
“ I would really like to see that video , ” Natalie said .
“
I can show you , ” Kenzie said , spinning around .
“
Careful , ” I said .
Natalie stopped in her tracks .   
Sveta ’s expression did n’t change an inch , but the tendrils I could see moved with more energy now .   
She seemed to notice that I ’d noticed , and broke eye contact .
“ We do n’t know if it would work across recorded video .
”
“
The Lady in Blue has the ability to influence parahumans , ” Byron said .   
“ Natalie is n’t one .
”
“
That ’s our line of thinking , ” I said .   
“
But I do n’t think anyone in this room is going to say that they ’re super happy with the way things have gone in the last couple of hours …
”
“
I ’m not super happy , but I ’m happy we ’re hanging out and doing something together , ” Kenzie said .
“ …
And it started because she surprised us with what she ’s capable of .   
However major , minor , or insignificant the influence might be , let ’s avoid future surprises .   
Capes keep tricks in their back pockets .   
Especially ones as effective and powerful as she is .
”
“ Noted , ” Natalie said .
“ If she could affect regular people , she would have , ” Sveta said .   
“
She would have a population under her thumb .   
From what we ’ve heard reported about her and her world , that ’s not the case .   
It ’s something she has to struggle against .   
That ’s our reality : people do n’t like parahumans , even when the parahumans did n’t do anything to deserve that dislike .   
I think all of us here have seen that in some form .
”
“
Okay , ” I said .   
“
Very probable , but
yes , while there are powers that discriminate to be parahuman only , there are rare cases where people with the potential to get powers can be included in that group .
”
“ If I could have triggered , I think I might have last night .
”   
Natalie ’s voice was quiet .   
She touched her shoulder .   
“
I think I ’m safe , but thank you , Victoria .
”
I opened my mouth to say something about how triggers did n’t necessarily work that way- that the popular thinking was that the reason they were so hard to provoke was that the trigger event needed to match the power that the person was primed to get .   
That someone could have a trigger of abject loss and heartbreak and not get a power , only to get one a few days later because they were threatened with bodily harm , or because their agent was waiting for a trigger event involving fire .
But I was grasping at straws , clinging to the science and the chances of danger .   
Was the risk really that great , that Goddess’ power included those with potential , that Natalie had that potential but mercifully had n’t realized it , and that Goddess’ influence would also work through a recorded video ?
“
What ’s going on with you , Victoria ?
” Sveta asked .   
Her face showed something closer to pity or disappointment .
My eyes dropped to the ground .   
“
I do n’t like this .
”
“ I do n’t like this either .   
I wish we could be on the same page about why we did n’t like this .
” I nodded .
“ Sveta , ” Byron said .
“
Hey , ” Sveta said , still in that small , sad voice , as she looked at him .   
“
I do n’t want you as an enemy either , Byron .   
I feel like I have n’t even gotten to know you .
”
He pulled off his helmet , clasping it in front of his stomach with both hands .   
Droplets of moisture from the rain still beaded some of his cheekbone , nose , and chin , and he had a spot of redness around one eyelid that had white edges in its midst , like skin peeling from a slight burn .
“
I ’m not totally on board with this , but Victoria and Chris were right .   
There are things we can all agree on , and being careful is one .   
That Teacher is dangerous and dangerous to our teammates is another .
”
Tension did n’t show in Sveta ’s body , but it showed in the details that wriggled around the edges and gaps , at her prosthetic neck that her head was perched on , and around her wig , almost indistinguishable from the locks of hair .   
It showed in the lines of her face , in features I would have called Eastern European .
Byron seemed to take Sveta ’s silence as reluctant agreement .   
“ Kenzie , when you ’re done with showing Natalie the video , can you talk us through what you ’re doing ?   
In the interest of being careful , I ’d like to make sure we ’re not making any missteps when it comes to this …
what is it we ’re doing , Victoria ?   
Shutting the door so Teacher ca n’t ?
”
“
Something like that , ” I said .
“ I ’ll show you in a sec , ” Kenzie said .
“
Let ’s make sure we have a good game plan , ” he said .   
“
And … Sveta , you and I stand at different sides on this , but we can balance each other out .   
We each justify where we ’re coming from , that keeps us level .
”
She remained silent .
“ I get where you ’re coming from , ” he said .   
“
Your past experiences-
” She shook her head .
“
But that was heated , irrational , driven by anger and emotion .
”
“ Communication is better , ” I added .
“
Speaking of staying level , or of balance , ” Sveta said the words slowly , almost dangerously , in a way that made me unsure if the words themselves were dangerous , or if she was implying threat .   
“
Are you going to release Tristan ?
”
“
No , ” Byron said .   
“ Not like this .
”
Sveta pursed her lips .
“ We took measures to ensure neither of us could go too far .   
Tristan is n’t a stupid guy , Sveta .   
Trust in that .
”
“
Let ’s focus on helping Ashley and Rain , ” I jumped in , before an argument could start .
“
Okay !
”
Kenzie said , clapping her hands together .   
“
My time to shine .
” Sveta walked over , her gait less even than usual , before stiffly placing a hand on Kenzie ’s shoulder .
“
So , based on what my scanner is picking up -I built one into my phone ’s camera to read any computer ’s data on the sly-
these gates cross dimensions , and they have to see where they ’re going .   
That ’s where I come in .   
Because machines see with … anyone ?
”
“ Cameras , ” Byron said .   
His eyes were n’t on Kenzie , but on the video footage of the fight .   
Natalie crouched by the table , watching .   
She glanced at me over one shoulder .
“ Cameras !   
Well , there are other ways for machines to see , and this is closer to feeling than to seeing , but I wo n’t get bogged down .   
It ’s close enough , and it ’s not that different from what I was experimenting with , when I was making a camera that might see Byron when Tristan is out , or vice - versus .
”
“ Versa .
”
“ Versa !   
Yes .   
So !   
A couple of ways I can do this .   
To use an analogy , I could take the camera ’s flash and crank it to always - on .   
Other gates trying to look in would see an overexposed image and they would n’t have a clear picture .
”
“
Would the prison notice ?
” I asked .
“
Flickering cameras and lights , maybe .   
Hair standing on end if you ’re in the right place for long enough .
”
“
And would it be traceable to the source ?   
To us ?
”
“ After a little while .   
But Goddess only needs a little while to do her thing , right ?   
So we could turn ours off just long enough to let her in and let her out , while not letting the other ones start up .   
That would leave the exit portal intact , which would be best for her .
”
“ I do n’t like that it could draw attention .   
What other options are there ?
”
“
Um .   
The way these gates work , they warm up and map out the surrounding area .   
It ’s a slow boil and it takes time , and I think they use multiple cameras to get a clearer picture .   
Then they flash , pulsing , to make sure there is n’t anything new in the area , like a person walking through the space at that time .   
Because that would skew the signal , I think .   
That part of it is a kind of mapping program , but it ’s instantaneous or spontaneous .
”
“
Can this camera be one of the multiple cameras ?
” I asked .   
“ Giving the other ones wrong info ?
”
“ It could .   
I think they could decipher that this one is the culprit and block it out , especially if they ’re already warmed up with their mapping done .   
And you asked about tracing the signal –
I think that would be a pretty big red alert for them , with a huge ‘ we are here’ sign above us .
”
“
That ’s a no , then .
”
“
It ’s good that you ’re thinking along those lines , though !
”
Kenzie said , like an instructor applauding her student for trying .   
“
And I do n’t blame you for not thinking of what I ’m thinking of , because the answer is more abstract and it ’s harder to make an analogy for .   
The best analogy I can think of is … our camera flash is white light and white light is centered , but if we tint the light from one camera ’s flash blue and green , which is up , then any other cameras are going to adjust more red because the image is skewed , which slants everything down .
”
“
What does that mean ?
” Sveta asked .
“
It means everything looks right for them until they try to make their electro - gate , it goes zap , and it tries to put a gate down , only it puts it in the ground .   
And it ’s subtle enough it wo n’t make people ’s hair stand up or make cameras flicker .
”
“ And the regular portal that lets them walk in ?
” I asked .
“
Well , that ’s sort of the thing .   
Because it ’s not light
, it ’s dimensions ,   so it would still skew with the signal and block it off .   
So that might tip people off if they try to use it .
”
“
Do they ?
” I asked .
“
Um .   
Not often .   
From surveillance , it ’s usually when work ends or when new prisoners come in , and nobody ’s acting like they ’re bringing anyone in .   
No prep , no prepared apartments .   
I think we ’re clear .
”
“ Surprises happen , ” I murmured .
Kenzie nodded , very enthusiastically .
“
That ’s good , though .   
It ’s a shame
we ca n’t keep the front door open just to make sure that everything does n’t go to hell the moment one employee tries to leave because they have an upset stomach , then close it later , if we have to .
”
“ Maybe we could ?
” Kenzie asked .   
She made a bit of a face , scrunching everything up .
“ You do n’t sound sure , ” Byron said .
“ If I situated our blue - green light right , maybe we could put it far enough away that the , um , the front door would n’t close .   
Except I ’m making an educated guess at that point .
”
“
And if we need to close the front door , we take the blue - green dimensional light this gate is making and move it closer ?
”
“
Turn it off , cool down for a few minutes , then turn it back on , situated closer .   
Yeah .
”
“
Are those few minutes long enough for them to do something ?
”
She scrunched up her face again , shrugging slightly .
“ We should contact Goddess , ” Sveta said .   
“
Let her know what we ’re doing .
”
“ And talk to the other teams ?
” I suggested .   
“
The Major Malfunctions wanted to know , and we could use help .
”
“ Chris wanted to keep things discrete , ” Byron said .   
“
Each group as a cell .   
We share info and maintain contact in a limited way .
”
“
She ’s our network hub , she can lead , ” Kenzie said .
“ We do n’t have a way of getting in touch with her .
”
“ We have a way of getting in touch with Chris , and Chris is with her , ” Sveta said .
“ I ’ll call him !
” Kenzie said .
“ Don’t- just … ” Byron started .   
He trailed off , looking to me for help .
I was n’t sure what to give him .   
I was aware of Sveta ’s stare .
“ …
I ’m going to step outside , ” he said .
“
Can I talk to you ?   
I ’d really appreciate your perspective on things , ” Natalie said .
Sveta ’s eyes bored into me .
But just as he could n’t really argue for a reason to not call Goddess , we could n’t give a reason for him not to step outside .   
Not without fights breaking out , one way or another .
The phone rang .   
Natalie hurried to get her coat on , flipping up her hood , before following Byron outside .
“
Who is this?”a
strange voice asked , voice amplified by the speakers .
“
It ’s Breakthrough , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Is Chris there ?
”
“
He is , ” the voice came through .   
It was male .   
“
He ’s not human right now .   
He gave me the phone .
”
“
Show us ?
” Kenzie asked .
“ I ’ll take a video ?
”
“ Please .
”
There was a pause .   
Then Kenzie brought up a video on the wall .   
It was an image taken from the ground , looking up .   
A tall figure , feathered , looked like a vulture might look if it had been rolled over with a truck .   
The neck twisted around and bent backward , the head lolling back and hanging with curved beak extending down , one yellow eye staring .   
Along the inside of arms , black eyes that were nearly invisible in the black and gray plumage blinked .   
It moved its head , raising one arm with taloned fingers at the end , and gestured in the affirmative , blinking slowly .
“
He ’s scratching something on the ground .   
He … did n’t give you his number ?
” Kenzie snorted .   
“
We ’re in the middle of something big .   
We wanted to talk strategy .   
Can you get her on the line ?
”
“
She ’s close .   
Let me get her , and I ’ll put you guys on speaker .
”
There was a moment ’s pause , the only sounds in the room being the sound of the rain outside , a torrent of water flowing from a gutter that was ajar , and the noises on the other side .   
As wrong as everything felt , my little betrayals of Sveta , my complicating things when they could be so simple , the idea of having Goddess decide on a course of action was awfully tempting .
I could hear the noise of Goddess arriving , with a rush of air , a rustling of the phone .
“ Breakthrough .
”
“ We were raided by Teacher when we checked on one of his pawns .   
She ’s the prison pharmacist , and she has laced drugs or something like it .   
She made it back to the prison .
”
“ Disappointing .   
What happened ?
”
“
It was what you described .   
A whole army .   
Not exactly marksmen , and not quite as coordinated as you described , but …
it was a lot , very suddenly , and we had rookies to protect .   
We did come away with some stuff we can use and a lot of thoughts .
”
In the background , Natalie stepped back inside .
“
There were n’t marksmen or coordinated strikes because his focus was and is on me .   
Even now , those assholes move against us .   
I ’ve tapped other resources .   
What thoughts or things that we can use do you have ?
”
“ Antares thinks we should lock off the prison , ” Kenzie volunteered .
“
Why ?
”
“ Pre - emptively , ” I answered Goddess .   
“ If we do it , then teacher ca n’t , and the people running the prison might not try to do it themselves .   
Why try to seal the door shut if it ’s already sealed ?
”
“
And we could still get you in , ” Kenzie said , all cheer and enthusiasm .
“
This is good .
”
I glanced back at Natalie .   
She had a very serious look on her face .
“
It goes a step further , ” I said .   
“ Teacher ’s a tricky guy because of his criminal history .   
He went from being a near complete unknown to being a top - tier player to getting arrested .   
It means that his records and the records I had in my files went from barren to high - tier confidential .
”
“ You looked at his files ?
”
“ After he first came up in relation to Earth Cheit .   
There was n’t much .   
But , ” I stressed the word ‘ but’ .   
“
There was some stuff on his thralls .   
Based on what we ’re seeing and what the PRT noted about them just in case they had to worry about infiltration in their own ranks , I think we can come up with strategies .
”
“
This is good .   
Explain for me .
”
“
His degree of control comes from his subjects having less volition .   
Less ability to make their own decisions , react quickly , problem solve .   
I was reminded when I saw some of them outside the pharmacist ’s house .   
They were practically zombies … ” ⊙ Within the prison , a red - haired correctional officer with a receding hairline sat with his share of monitors in view .   
The monitors showed several camera feeds each .
“ Sending low - risk inmates to dinner in fifteen , ” a man at the center of the room said .   
“
Kitchens will have meals going out to high - risk buildings in twenty - five , once the cafeteria doors are shut .   
Start - shift ready ?
”
“ Lagging in change .
”
“ Tell them to get a move on .   
I want more bodies on the ground .   
Exit - shift ?
”
“ They ’re at posts .
”
“ Meds ? ”
“ Coming out of the pharmacy .   
Betty and her escort .   
They ’ll make it to the caf and back with time to spare .
”
“ Red , remind us of any incidents today .
”
“ Johnny in building C , room four ate his own hands for bio - material .   
He ’s locked up and in quarantine .   
Supposed low - risk inmate Screwdriver attacked her roommate this morning .   
Screwdriver is off - site and staying that way for the day , her roommate Gosling is recovering from surgery .   
Damsel One and Damsel Two are being quiet-
mostly keeping to the internet .   
No sign of agitation , but we ’re watching closely after a Damsel Three allegedly appeared on television twenty - four hours ago .
”
“ If only we got television here , ” one correctional officer said .
“ If you did , you would n’t watch the screens , ” the superior said .   
“
Stay the course , people .   
I want tonight to be quiet .
”
As the superior walked around the room , checking on things , including screens with low - res images of various icons moving across a map , the officer with the receding hairline saw words on his screen .
Radio silence from here on out .   
Avoid phones . 

Phones and computers are monitored . 

-Teacher
He looked around , making sure the coast was clear .
Communicate all points to others .   
Nod if understood .
The officer looked over his shoulder at the camera .   
He nodded .
Bomb anklets must be deactivated ASAP . 

Prisoner population must be preserved .
He glanced back , then nodded slightly once again .
The screen went clear .
My heart pounded in my chest as I watched him lean over to the correctional officer next to him , whispering in her ear .
Goddess had said that her danger sense was n’t flaring from this , and it was apparently nuanced enough to tell her if this was a horribly bad idea .   
We were good to go , at least in the initial stages of this juncture .
“ … got ta run to the washroom , ” the officer said .
“
Now ?
” the supervisor asked .   
“ Thirteen minutes until we serve them their third square .
”
“ I wo n’t be long .
”
“ Aaron , take the console from Nick .
”
Someone else took over .   
Our officer strode from the room , using his keycard to get through the door and to the hallway .
Teacher ’s influence turned them more and more into zombies as he asserted more control , but there was no fine mind control .   
They were n’t puppets , and they had to be told what to do .
The lack of volition and the weaker problem solving meant they were more gullible .
“
Should I message someone else ?
” Kenzie asked .
“
Let ’s not test our luck , ” I murmured .
The guard headed straight to a guard who was at one T - shaped intersection of hallways .   
He leaned close to say something .   
On Kenzie ’s projected image , lines traced his lips and mouth movements .   
A line of gibberish appeared , then was deleted .
“ Could n’t read his lips .   
The program might work after a few tries with the right camera angles , ” Kenzie said .
“ Three factions have the power to win , lose , or decide the course of this game , ”
I said , to Sveta .   
“
Us , Teacher , and the prison .   
There are others- the prisoners notably among them .
”
“ They ca n’t win or lose .   
They ’re just-
”
“
Part of this .   
Except for a select few , like Precipice , Swansong , Monokeros , and Crystalclear .
”
“ Crystalclear is onboard , ” Byron said .   
he was at his laptop , hunched over it .   
“ Foresight just emailed me .   
They ’re ready when we are .
”
“
And the teams we put on people related to the prison and around the prison are on standby , ” I said .   
Kenzie ’s arm pointed up and waved around , less focused on the specific target than it was indicating a series of overlapping maps .   
The teams were represented by icons .   
All of the ones who ’d been planted in nearby areas of the Megalopolis were now stationed within a few blocks of the first of the two portals .
We ’d identified our correctional officer because he knew the pharmacist well enough to be one of the first people she ’d communicated with once through the portal .   
Now , through him and the course he traveled , with information backed up from our series of ‘ dominoes’ , people we ’d already noted as likely Teacher - compromised , because of their contact with those confirmed as compromised , we were able to confirm our suspicions on most counts .   
Each person was marked with a ‘ T’ in a silvery - blue circle over their heads .
“ Phones ?
” I asked .
“ Still blocked .   
Only a few people have noticed but they ’re treating it
like it ’s an ordinary thing , ” Kenzie said .   
“ None of them are our targets .
” Byron fidgeted .   
Natalie was beside him , and she looked even more nervous .
I was nervous , and I could n’t even imagine how they felt .
Unspoken in this equation was Goddess .   
We were working on the Teacher issue , and we were all on the same page with it .   
When Goddess stepped in … I was n’t even sure .
“
Things are going to get messy soon , ” Kenzie said .
My head turned .
On the screen , it was Ashley on one side , and Rain on the other .   
She was telling them , so they could be ready .
“ We ’ll do what little we can to keep the peace , ” Rain said .
“
Or if it comes to it , we take out the people who insist on taking advantage of any lack of peace , ” Ashley said .
The officer was walking briskly toward a stairwell , taking them two at a time on his way up to the top floor of the admin building .
“ Is Foresight ready ?
”
“ I think so , ” Byron said .
The prison had administration like any business did , though the ranks sounded like military ones , they were closer to being a business in reality .   
The warden was like the C.E.O. , the deputy warden like the vice president , and in this case , the assistant warden was their equivalent to their chief financial officer , with some added responsibilities .
Our red - haired correctional officer with the receding hairline and the worry lines across his forehead walked past the assistant warden ’s office , where the man within was doing paperwork , glancing up for only a moment .   
He went straight to the deputy warden ’s office , knocking on her open door .
Stop there , come on .   
Come on .
He held a finger to his mouth , then indicated the office next door .   
Not the office of the assistant warden , but of the warden himself .
My heart sank a bit at that .   
It could n’t be easy .
The heavyset deputy and officer both headed into the warden ’s office .
The officer said something we could n’t make out , his face not at an angle where the camera could see his lips .
“
That makes no sense at all , ” the warden said .   
“
You left your post for this ?
”
“ I ’m doing as instructed .
”
“
Are you sure you saw this ?   
Your eyes or imagination were n’t playing tricks on you ?
”
“
No . ”
“
I ’m letting Foresight know now , ” Byron whispered , so as not to hamper our eavesdropping too much .   
I gave him a nod of confirmation .
“
What did it say , explicitly ?
”
“
To not trust phones , to make sure the bombs were disabled .
”
“ We could abort , ” the deputy murmured the words to the warden .   
The camera did catch her lips , providing sharp text to clarify the muddy ‘ could’ and ‘ abort’ , which the crummy microphone on the security camera did n’t pick up .
“
The anklets ?
”
“
Hold off , ” the warden said .
Okay , not the biggest surprise in the world .   
Both warden and deputy warden were Teacher
’s .   
Being Teacher
’s , they were invested in what he was invested in .   
And Teacher , as far as we could figure , had every interest in using Cheit , his thralls , and his manipulation of the prison to capture Goddess and turn the entire prison into a barrel of fish he could then repeatedly shoot .   
A large number of high - priority targets with powers , with nobody able to interrupt or gainsay him .
There were situations where the ankle bombs factored in , ones where they eliminated target individuals or tried to get control of a failing situation with threats , but it made next to no sense for them to simply wipe prisoners out en masse , even now that things were sliding into chaos .   
I ’d observed that there were three critical teams here .   
Two of them did n’t want to see prisoners blow up –
Teacher ’s and ours .
As for the third , on another camera , the assistant warden was picking up his phone .   
Foresight was on the other end , and they would be explaining their situation .   
They had two people in the prison .   
If our alliance with them counted , they had four total .   
Hopefully they would be convincing , because as the third person in the hierarchy of the prison , the assistant warden was number three- a man with a nice suit and tie , tousled hair , and eyelashes and eyebrows so thin that it looked like he had none at all .
Foresight would be outlining the situation and explaining priorities to him .
And Breakthrough would be dealing with the leaders of the thralls .
“
This is n’t right , ” the head warden said .   
He turned to his computer , circling the desk to get to it .
Kenzie hit a key .
Nothing happened .
She smashed the keyboard with her fist .
Again , nothing happened .
“
Umm .
”
The lights went out in the building .   
After a moment ’s delay , red lights in the ceiling came on .
“ Time delay , ” Kenzie said .   
“
He did n’t make it past the login screen .   
We ’re clear .
”
In his office , the assistant warden was on the phone .   
Going by the script , Foresight should be telling him to pretend like the phone was n’t working .   
In the tension of the moment , he took it a step too far , banging the phone against his desk .   
Everyone in the room winced .
On the cameras , a world of prison administration under stark red emergency lighting , we could see the deputy , head warden , and the correctional officer all leaving .   
The officer broke from the group to check on the assistant warden , who was in his office , phone on his desk .
A shake of the head and of the phone confirmed suspicions .
“
Stay , Toby , ” the head warden instructed , leaning past the officer .   
“ Watch the office and be ready if we get power again .
”
Toby the assistant warden hesitated .   
Was he weighing his trust for Foresight against his trust for coworkers ?
He stayed .   
The moment his two seniors were gone with the officer , he had the phone to his ear , listening .
“ If they get near a computer , black them out , ” I said .   
Needlessly , we ’d already established the plan .   
It made me feel better to spell it out .
“
On it .
”
It was a situation defined by chaos , and we had some modicum of control .   
Teacher had an army at his disposal , it seemed , but that army had been paid for with his power , and that power had its price .
He would make his play , but we had our own .   
It was a question of keeping an eye out and timing everything right .   
I ’d thought of Teacher like a tinker , his human resources simply parts of a broader system he ’d designed .   
Tinkers were most dangerous when they could anticipate their threats , and they were least dangerous when surprised .
We would strive to surprise .
“
Assistant warden ’s cleared by Foresight .   
We can tell him everything ?
” Byron asked .
I nodded .
“ So far so good , ” Sveta whispered .
I did n’t want to jinx it by agreeing , but the two of us were on shaky ground .
“
Yeah , ” I responded .   
“ Except-
”
“
Except ? ”
Byron asked .
Goddess .   
She had n’t made her move .   
There was a point she was supposed to enter the prison and take her prisoners .   
It was a big reason for why Byron , Natalie and I were so tense .
The moment that happened , everything else was up in the air .
My hope was that by having Goddess there , we could seal her in and scramble the signal .   
We had people on the inside we could reach out to , but my real hope was that her power would be of the wide - reaching sort that did n’t reach through dimensions .   
If we could cut off the flow and close the doors … maybe this alleged influence would slip away .   
Breakthrough would be free .
Dinner was being canceled relatively quietly .   
Relatively because the prisoners were complaining , balking .   
They wanted their grub .   
But Foresight had the assistant warden in their corner , and he ’d made the calls necessary .
“ Computer screens at one end of the prison are flickering , ” Kenzie reported .   
She hit buttons .   
The super - low - res copies of the security screens in question were blown up large on one wall .   
They showed what had to be at least third - hand video feeds .   
Computer screens caught on one security camera above them , viewed through another daisy chain of security apparatuses , and then displayed on our wall .
Sure enough , one computer monitor blacked out , fritzed , and then went normal .   
A moment later , an entire row flickered , one by one , left to right .
“
He ’s sending his army in .   
They know something ’s wrong , ” Kenzie remarked .
“ We do n’t have eyes on them ?
”
She shook her head .   
“
I think … they ’re out on the outskirts of the prison .
”
“
Alright , ” I said .
We did n’t have Goddess in our net .   
As wrong as that felt … I glanced over at Byron .   
He met my eyes .
“ Shut the door , ” I said .   
“
He ’s got just enough of an army in there to lose all plausible deniability .
”
“ Shutting the door ,    blue - green tint .   
We ’ll see how fast his hornet ’s nest of underlings figure out what we did .
”
Door shut .   
Ankle - bombs disabled for now and with nobody really in a position to want to use them , provided things stayed peaceful .   
Teacher ’s forces were caught with their pants down and no communication or way back to their leadership .   
Hero teams were on the periphery , with eyes on the suspicious , primed to join in if they needed to quell riots .
This did n’t feel over .
The door opened , and my first thought was Cryptid .   
Our messenger .
It was n’t him .   
Everyone in the room stood up a little straighter .   
Natalie backed up a step .
Goddess was as dry as a bone as she stepped into our headquarters .   
Amy was a step behind her , looking less confident than I ’d seen her yet , before or after everything .
“
I ’ve been told it ’s done .   
Everything ’s ready for my arrival ?
”
“
Yeah , ” Byron said .   
“
I guess it is .
”
“ You ’ll all come to the prison , then , ” she said .   
“
You .   
You have no powers ?
”
“
N - no , ” Natalie stuttered .
“ You ’ll come as well .   
Witness .
”
“ But-
”
“
It ’s not a fucking request .   
Do n’t try my patience .
”
“ Okay , ” Natalie said , not sounding happy about it .
“ Why are we going ?
” I asked .   
I met Amy ’s eyes .   
She looked away .
“
Because I was told most of you were there to talk to me , and most is n’t good enough .   
You ’ll all stay with me until I ’m sure I do n’t need to be concerned about any of you .
”
“ I do n’t think you need to worry anymore , ” Byron said .   
He sighed .
He switched to Tristan , without a second thought .
I could see Tristan ’s expression change as he realized he was free .   
It started somewhere in the neighborhood of anger , and it became something closer to fury .
It froze and became momentary confusion as Goddess set her hand on his shoulder .   
Coming back to reality .
“ Save that anger for our enemies , ” she said .   
“
We have plenty of them waiting for us . ”








For those who missed it , there was a Thursday update .   
See the prior chapter .
⊙ Sveta was smiling , her face more relaxed than it had been when she had been challenging Byron and I.    Things were balanced out .   
Kenzie was content enough .
Yet somehow , with whatever effect Goddess was supposed to have , more people in the room were upset than content .   
Me .   
Natalie .
Amy .   
I did n’t want to think about or focus on Amy .   
I did n’t want to think about the fact that she was here , invading my space yet again .   
I could still recognize that she was n’t happy with the current dynamic .
Tristan .
For all the advice , the good advice , that Tristan was supposed to calm down and focus his efforts on our number one enemies here , he was as angry as I ’d ever seen him .   
He ’d taken off the bulk of his armor before switching out to Byron , and I had a full view of his face and neck .   
I could see his eyes .
He turned those eyes toward me .   
The look was dark , the tilt of his head and the overhead lights casting the sockets in shadow , with the shadows branching out through the lines along the nose and between the eyebrows .   
His fist was clenched .
A study in contrasts .   
In the moment before he had disappeared , Byron had looked okay .   
Less tense than I ’d known him to be in a long time .
“
Enough , ” Goddess told him .   
“ I ca n’t stand infighting .
”
He did n’t back down , and he did n’t break eye contact .
“
I ’ve talked to some of my contacts .   
They claim they ’re ready .   
Tell me what you ’ve done .
”
“ We had a skirmish with Teacher , ” I said .   
“
The team that helped us with that should sit this one out .     
They ’re depleted and as eager as they are , they ’re also inexperienced .   
Tiredness combined with being spent is a recipe for disaster .
”
“ You have others ?
”
“
Plenty of others , ”
I told her .
“
When you said ‘ the team that helped us’ , who was ‘ us’ .   
Everyone went ?
”
“
Capricorn and myself , ” I said .   
“ Capricorn blue , to be specific .
”
She looked at Tristan .   
Seeing him still staring me down , she touched his shoulder .   
He turned away from me to look at her .
“ They ran into a cape , ” Tristan said .   
“
Set powers and interdimensional doors on fire .
”
“
I know her .   
Teacher will send her after me sometimes .
”
“
She ’s the prison pharmacist .   
She ’ll be there .
”
Goddess did n’t seem to be too bothered by that .
“
Where ’s Cryptid ?
” Kenzie asked .
“ Assisting me .   
He ’s with the team that ’s looking for the girl who has my power .
”
“
Oh , cool .   
He ’ll be good at that .
”
“
Can you give us more information on that ?
” I asked .   
“
I ’ve studied powers in the past .
”
“
On the day of the final confrontation against the alien , I was pulled away from my world .   
Many of my lieutenants and parahuman inhabitants of my world were as well .   
When everything ended , Several of my lieutenants slipped from my reach .   
I ’ve found all but one .   
The craven bitch was one of the five others who got powers when I did .
”
“
One of your other enemies has mentioned your background , and that you … somehow took the powers from the group , ” I said .
“ Tattletale ?   
Yes .   
She ’s similar to the woman with the fire .   
She shows up at very inconvenient times .   
Sometimes because she ’s an unwitting pawn moved by Teacher .   
Right now she ’s busy keeping her area of this mega - city from collapsing .   
A cursed place , Amy says .
” I flinched at the name .   
I ’d almost been able to pretend she was n’t here .
“
It ’s probably because of the fact that she ’s busy that Teacher is doing what he ’s doing now , ” Amy said .
“ I want to ask , why are you here , Amy ?
” Sveta asked .
“
Um .   
I ’m kind of uniquely situated to get a lot of this .   
I knew Teacher , I knew Valkyrie , I ’ve talked to Tattletale a few times , I had a sense of what was happening with Gold Morning before some others .
”
I folded my arms .
“
What I was asking is why are you here ?
” Sveta said .   
“
In this headquarters .
”
“
Because I wanted to make sure that everyone is okay .
”
“
Your being here makes things less
okay , ” Sveta said .   
“
I ’m speaking for your sister here , because I ’m sure she ’s trying to avoid causing issues .
”
My arms still folded , I nodded emphatically , my eyes averted to the ground .
“
You ’re causing problems , ” Sveta said .
“
I ’m trying to take care of everyone , including the people important to me .
”
“
Enough of this ,
” Goddess spoke , her voice sharp .
Sveta shut up .   
Amy went silent .
“ Antares , ” Goddess said .   
“
My power testing labs are very good and thorough .   
I ca n’t imagine you have any new information for me .
”
“
Can I ask what her power is ?   
I might not know things that are better than what you learned from your labs , but I keep track of capes , as much as it ’s possible , with clandestine groups and cults coming out of the woodwork .
”
“
A power battery .   
She has five very minor powers , scraps of powers , but she has the ability to charge one , extending its range out dramatically in a straight line , usable once every long while .
”
“
And with this power back , you ’d extend your range ?
”
“ In a sense , ” she said .   
She made eye contact , and there was something searching in her gaze .   
“
Not straight lines .
”
“ Including the brainwashing ?
” Natalie asked .
“
Nothing is washed , ” Goddess said , her voice hard .
“ It is aligned .
” Natalie nodded , ducking her head down .
Her answer to Natalie ’s question had n’t been a no .
“ If you ’re done interrogating me , tell me about the prison .
”
“ I lensed the energy the gates put out to throw Teacher
’s attempts to get in or out out of whack .   
Teacher ’s pawns are stupid-
”
“ They lack volition , ” I said .
“
And they ’re gullible , which means they ’re stupid .   
We tricked them into talking to each other and we have most of them identified .
”
“ Including the people in charge that Teacher got to , ” Tristan said .
He did n’t look any calmer .   
It was an uncharacteristically cold kind of anger , though , one that left his voice level even as it stood out across his face , neck , and arms .
I could sympathize , on a level , but my anger was n’t hot or cold .   
It just felt sick .   
It carried forward from the sick feeling that had come from being at odds with Sveta .   
I was thankful that she was defending me and that she was n’t causing issues , because I was n’t sure if I could have managed if she did n’t have my back right now .
“
We control the access for now , ” Kenzie said .   
“
He ’s trying to figure it out , but … I ’m looking at data , and it looks like he keeps trying to open the portals a hundred feet below the prison .   
The energy diffuses out into the ground .   
He did four tries almost right away , and …
it ’s been a little while since then .   
He made one try , still down there .   
I think he might be out of energy .
”
“
Good , ” Goddess said .   
She smiled .   
“ Good work .
”
Kenzie ’s legs kicked , as she wiggled .
“ Get ready .   
We ’ll go now , ” Goddess said .
“ We have one more play that ’s in the works , ” I said .   
“
An ally is going to make a move , and we should watch what happens
so we know where people are .
”
“
Get ready in the meantime , then .
” I met Tristan ’s eyes briefly as he turned toward the corner where he ’d left his armor .   
Still angry , in an inexplicable way .
There was too much to keep a handle on , and telling myself master - stranger protocols felt like it was about as substantial as shouting ‘ Santa is real!’ when I knew he
wasn’t- and Byron had been compromised .
My option now was Natalie , who I could maybe trust but could n’t rely on , because so much of this cape stuff went over her head .
Or … or Amy .   
Who maybe knew the cape stuff , but who I could n’t ever trust .
Natalie .   
I could n’t reach out to her now .
And the others … compromised , by the rules and guidelines stipulated in black and white , outlined in tests that tens of thousands of PRT employees had to take and perfect , even the desk jockeys .
I checked my phone .   
My phone was safe , covering distant territory .   
No messages had been sent by Rain or Ashley before all communications had been shut off .   
I looked at the monitors- also safe .
People were heading toward the cafeteria , and in that group , I could see Crystalclear and Rain .   
It was good .   
Coalbelcher was in the group with some of his lieutenants .   
Less good .
In her apartment , Ashley stood with her back to the kitchen counter , her head bowed , her arms folded .   
The Damsel , for lack of a better description , sat on a chair , one arm draped over the back , the other along the table , by the laptop that was now closed .   
It was n’t much use to them , now that the internet was cut off as well .
Another screen showed the video feed from Ashley ’s eye - cam .   
Once we were inside , if for any reason she was n’t still in her apartment , then chances were good that we ’d have to deduce her location .
Goddess walked over to look at the screens .   
Kenzie , organizing her stuff and unplugging things from the computer , looked up .
Amy moved in my peripheral vision .   
I shifted my stance .   
My aura was on and off in such a short period of time it barely rippled past my skin .
She was n’t focusing on me .   
She ’d taken a step toward Sveta , who was attaching her armor , her mask on the table next to her .
“
Hello , ” the small creature on Amy ’s shoulder said , voice high .   
A few people glanced over .
“
Hello , ” Sveta said , before returning to what she was doing .   
She kept Amy in the corner of her eye .
“ Dot , meet Tress , ” Amy said .   
“
My mother told me a lot about her , and I make- made small talk with her boyfriend when I ran into him at the Wardens headquarters .
”
“ You have a machine body , and you do n’t smell much like flesh or blood .
”
“ Be polite , ” Amy said .
“
It ’s good !
”
Dot exclaimed .   
“ So special , to have something made like that .   
A lot of love and care .
”
“
There was , ” Sveta said .   
“
The most important person in the world had to work hard to make it even possible , and someone had to study very hard to learn how to make it , and that ’s a kind of love too .
”
Lookout , helmet on , gear gathered , approached to get a better look at Dot .   
I opened my mouth to express a warning , but Lookout stepped back as Amy turned to look at her .
Good , I thought .
Dot did n’t seem to care , instead adjusting her perch on Amy ’s shoulder .
“
My Red Queen does good work with a lot of love too , ” Dot said .
“
I ’ve seen the work she does , ” Sveta said .
I could feel a weight pressing in on me .   
Amy looking my way made it worse .
Tristan , on the other end of the room , was getting his armor on .   
He watched intently , still silent , but for a few of the strategic comments he ’d dropped for Goddess .
“ Natalie , ” I said .   
I was desperate for an out .   
“
Can we talk organization ?
”
“ Please , ” she said .
“ We can step outside , ”
I said , “ If you do n’t mind your jacket getting wet .   
Give these guys some elbow room .
” Natalie nodded .
“ Stay inside , ” Goddess said .
There went that plan .
Why did this have to be so hard ?   
One person standing in the center of the room while her squirrel - like companion made small talk was harder to deal with than just about anything .
“
My Red Queen has fixed a few of my kind .   
Big ones , weird ones .   
She could fix you .   
She can make you just as wonderful in shape and strong enough you do n’t need the body .
”
“
Do n’t volunteer me , ” Amy said .   
“
Things are more complicated than that .
”
“
But you can !   
You can make her any shape at all , and then she wo n’t need that machine anymore !   
Then I can take a hand or take an arm !   
It ’s all so colorful !
”
“
That ’s enough .   
I ’m sorry , Sveta .
”
Sveta did n’t respond , only giving Amy a cold look that , ten minutes ago , she ’d been directing at me .
“
But I want- ” Dot started .   
Amy brought up a hand , and stroked Dot like Dot was a cat .   
I saw the contact , and revulsion gripped my entire body .
Natalie looked between Amy and me , and then stepped closer to me , hand moving as if she was going to touch me .   
I flinched , and she stopped .
I nodded , and she touched my upper arm , just below the ornamentation of spires there .   
She moved between Amy and me , blocking my view , and the gratitude that rolled through me could have stopped a moving vehicle .
I hated feeling weak and powerless in front of people like this- in front of Lookout , who could n’t understand .   
In front of Sveta , Tristan , and Goddess .
I looked away , tried to swallow and it got stuck , caught somewhere between up and down , in a position that paralyzed , too ominous for me to figure out how to breathe again .   
I really truly felt like forcing it would leave me either choking , if I moved one way , or outright coughing out a mouthful of vomit .
Fuck her .   
Fuck her for being here .   
Fuck her for intruding , for not getting it .   
Fuck her for her selfishness .
In anger , disgust receded .   
I could swallow , the motion hard enough it hurt .
“
What ’s going on ?
” Natalie whispered .   
“
This is Goddess’ mind control effect ?   
And you ’re resisting it ?
”
“ I ’m not resisting it , ” I murmured .   
“
Every iota of my being is telling me that it ’s not a problem
, it ’s minor ,
I ’m making the sensible calls .   
But Byron said I ’m affected .
”
“
Byron is-
”
she turned to look in Tristan ’s direction .
“
He ’s affected now .   
Swansong and Precipice too .
”
“
Oh , ” she said .   
“
What do I do ?
”
“ If you ask me , we ride this out , treat Teacher as the bigger threat , and we deal with that first .   
We resolve the prison situation and we let Goddess go rule her world as she sees fit .   
If she asks , we go with , we switch our focus … a lot could be done if we do our part there and use that work and accomplishments there to help Gimel .
”
“
And if she says she wants to destroy Gimel ?
”
“ My first instinct would be to evacuate everyone and then destroy it .
”
“
And if she did n’t want to evacuate ?   
Kill everyone ?
”
“ I could n’t do that , ” I said .
“ Just like in the video , then , ” Natalie said .
She ’d seen Byron fighting me , had apparently heard the audio .
“ I can get away and call people , ” she murmured .   
“
The Wardens ?
”
“ I think you trying would set off her danger sense , ” I said .   
And as I said it , I turned my head .
Goddess stood by the computer terminal .   
Lookout was standing by her again , chattering away .   
Goddess was n’t listening , though .   
She was watching Natalie and I. “ Be safe , ” I said .   
“
We ’ll figure something out .
” Natalie nodded .
I was pretty sure I was lying .
“
Do you know master - stranger protocols ?
”
I asked her , my voice a dire whisper .
As expected , she shook her head .
“ You ’re not compromised .   
If you say to do something , anything , I ’m going to put my trust in you .   
Byron might .   
I do n’t know .
”
Natalie opened her mouth to reply .   
She was interrupted by a change in the lighting .   
A whole wall of projected images flicked over to being a single image from a surveillance camera .   
It was in color , and the sky on the other side was lit by hues ranging from blue to pink and orange .   
The shadows of the people in the image were long .
Rain was a step behind Crystalclear .
On another wall , in another panel of projected image , Ashley had moved to the balcony .   
Damsel stood beside her , claws wrapped around the railing .   
Others were watching too .
“ Audio , ” Tristan said .
“ … this with full knowledge of the consequences , ” Crystalclear said .   
He ’d been close to the head of the group of prisoners that were going to the cafeteria to eat , and now he stopped , arms out to the sides .   
Guards were moving to flank , weapons drawn .
“
Do n’t be stupid , Crystalclear .   
Your record is good , you have n’t had problems yet !
”
“
Yeh , do n’t be stupid , ” Coalbelcher ’s voice was accented , with nasal intonation that did n’t fit him .   
“
I was looking forward to my dinner , and I get cranky when something or someone gets in the way of that .
”
“ I have it on good authority that this prison is under attack as we speak .   
Part of that attack involves the drugs they intend to hand out at the cafeteria .   
I ’m
asking you to put a lockdown in effect and put everything on hold , medication included .
”
“
I ’m seconding this , ” Rain said .
“
You ’re delaying our dinner , boys ?
” Coalbelcher asked .
“
Yes sir , sorry sir , ” Rain said .
“ Not smart .
”
“
Stand down , everyone else , kneel !   
I do n’t want funny business !
”
The other prisoners in Rain and Crystalclear ’s group were dropping to their knees .
“
If a few hours pass and nothing happens , feel free to come after us , Coal , but we ’re pretty sure on this , ” Crystalclear said .
“
Us , ” Rain said .   
“ Put me out there , feel free .
”
“
Sorry , ” Crystalclear added .
“
I ’m going to make you sorry if these guards do n’t .   
Getting between me and my motherfucking meal .
” Coalbelcher growled .   
From a distance , through the speaker , it sounded more like a child trying to sound menacing .   
I wondered if he was more dangerous - sounding in person , backed by reputation , in a Brando - as - Godfather way .
“ Down on the ground !
”
a guard called , indicating Crystalclear .
“
I ’m already kneeling .
”
“ Chin to dirt !
”
“
Again , requesting facility - wide lockdown .
”
“ Chin to the fucking dirt !
”
“
Figured it would n’t work , ” Rain said .
Crystalclear dropped , hands at the back of his head .
“
We ’re going to cuff you , and then we ’re going to take you two back-
”
An explosion .
Lookout hit keys .   
Our view shifted to surveillance camera footage of the cafeteria .   
The detonation had wrecked the door and surrounding brickwork .
“
By the look and sound of that , it seems like Crystalclear ’s power , ” I said , my voice quieter than I ’d meant it to be .
“
At least they do n’t realize it ’s him , ” Sveta said .
“
Yeah .   
They had to take the guy who can grow explosive crystals on his head and send them through solid surfaces face - first against the ground , huh ?
”
The guards were focusing on getting the prisoners away from the site of the blast .   
Crystalclear and Rain were pulled to their feet .   
They did n’t seem to realize that it had been Crystalclear .   
It was possible they knew what he did on paper , but recognizing it in the field was something else entirely .
“ Over there , ” Rain said , turning his head .
Crystalclear stumbled as he turned partially around , while the guard had a hand at the back of his prison - issue jacket .   
As part of the stumble , he brought his leg back and kicked , scuffing the ground .
A moment ’s delay , and- an explosion , off - screen .
“
Can you get that for us , Lookout ?
”
Amy had moved closer to me in her effort to see what was going on in the video .   
Natalie positioned herself , guarding me .   
Sveta , too , had moved to another point .
Goddess was watching but not intervening .   
I knew she meant well , but
… Lookout ’s voice cut through my thoughts .   
“
Going back ten seconds .   
Play .
”
Video footage .   
People running from the cafeteria .   
One of them was the pharmacist , marked with an icon over her head , courtesy of Lookout ’s tech .
Crystalclear had to have put a crystal in his shoe , because he ’d sent something forward when he ’d scuffed the dirt with his toe .   
The explosion was the usual Crystalclear sort , but as it hit the pharmacist , she flinched , reacting , and the explosion unfolded into something more dramatic , with rolling waves of purple flame .
The shoe - crystal would ’ve been his plan for if they had n’t had him put his head to the ground .
The smoke was clearing away .   
Our pharmacist was fine in the wake of it .   
Of fucking course .
“
That ’s our cue , ” Tristan said .   
“ We ’ll have to trust they ’ve got this figured out .   
Rain and Crystal know what the pharmacist can do .
”
Goddess turned toward the door .   
With a power , she bid it to open .   
Wind and flecks of moisture came in , beading the first few feet of floorboards .   
As she approached , however , wind and rain stopped .
The group headed for the fire escape , Goddess lifting herself up to the railing , then floating down .   
Tristan was behind her .
My thoughts were on Crystalclear and Rain , on the pharmacist , and how we ’d travel to get there .   
To my right , a supporting hand reached for my shoulder .
It was a colorful hand in my peripheral vision .   
My first thought was that it was Sveta .   
Then , after processing color , that Natalie had pulled on gloves .
A hand of mostly red , black secondary , with lines of gold running through it for highlights .
I had n’t even fully processed the thought , or the warning shout of , “ No !
” before I was flying .   
Forcefield out-
I swung to strike her pre - emptively , before she could make contact .
The swing came at a downward angle .   
Floorboards became splinters , and I could hear Lookout shriek off to the side .   
I saw Amy ’s eyes wide , her stumbling steps back as the floor shifted subtly under her feet .   
Dot went from under her jacket to her shoulder , then bounded off .
Floating , I had no reason to move a hair .   
I ’d spent so long trying to avoid thinking about her , trying to find my equilibrium , to deal .   
Even swallowing or breathing could be made hard .   
Wearing skin could be hard , when the idea of her was close .
But if I did n’t move a hair , if I was a statue , all bridled fury and potential energy , I could stare her down , and hope that there was something that I could convey here .
My aura was still active .   
I was probably disturbing the neighbors .   
Just like with the swallowing , I could n’t bring myself to do more than hold it in uncomfortable , bad - for - me limbo .
“ Victoria , ” Sveta said .
“
Sorry about the floorboards , ” I said .   
I did n’t look , but it was hard to miss , even in peripheral vision .   
“
That ’s probably the security deposit and then some .
”
Amy ’s lips parted .   
Anger flared in my chest .   
She got out just the two and a half words , “ I ’ll pay-
” I flew in , Wretch up .   
She hurled herself back and away , and it was like she was moving in slow motion .   
My flight was faster than her running .
Something connected with my forcefield .   
With it , the paradigm shifted .   
I could n’t be close , could n’t risk being touched .   
I changed the direction of my flight , placing myself near the wall .
It had been Sveta .   
As I turned around , she was reeling in her arm .
Amy had to circumnavigate the hole I ’d put in the floor to get to the door .   
Dot jumped from Lookout ’s arms to Amy ’s shoulder as she passed .
“ You ’ll be happier if you stop here , ” Sveta said .   
“
We have a mission .
”
The mission .
Do what ’s lawful , do what ’s right , when neither are clear , reach out for help .
The law and right are n’t in the prison right now .   
They needed help .
“
Okay , ” I said .   
“
Absolutely .
”
I headed for the door .   
Sveta reached out , extending an arm to my shoulder .   
I stopped .
“ Give her a second to leave .   
Some distance will be good , ” Sveta said .
“
She wo n’t leave , ” I said .   
“
Because leaving would be the right thing to do .   
I have to make her .
”
Sveta ’s expression shifted , a frown .
“
Sorry , Lookout , ” I said .   
“
I probably spooked you .
”
She laughed .   
I imagined a smile on her face , on the other side of her mask .
I floated past the hole and through the door .   
I had to lower my head a little
so I did n’t get a faceful of freezing rain .
On the ground beside the fire escape , Amy stood beside Goddess .   
She had n’t left .
“
Sorry , Natalie , ” I said , as I passed her .   
She was standing on the uppermost stair that was n’t the landing at the top of the fire escape .
“
No , ” she said , her voice small .   
“ I get it .
”
I wondered if she actually did , now .
Goddess was staring me down , looking utterly unbothered , beyond maybe some impatience about getting to the prison .   
Amy stood a little ways back , in her civilian clothes , her jacket ’s hood up , her eyes not visible .
And I was-
I was shaking , like the cold had gotten to me .
It had n’t , but close enough .
As I drew nearer , I brought the Wretch out .   
I let the rain outline it .
Goddess did n’t flinch .   
Amy-
I saw Amy take a step back .   
She said something I could n’t make out over the drum of the rain .
I flew around the pair- put myself in front of her , instead .   
I touched down on the surface of the parking lot , and the Wretch scratched at it , scrabbled at it with multiple fingernails of a multitude of hands .
She turned away , and I put myself in her field of view again , my expression like stone because anything else would have broken in a second .   
My fists were clenched , and I was acutely aware of the burn … yet I did n’t feel pain .   
Even the old bullet wound in my upper arm did n’t hurt in this moment , which made me realize it usually did , just a bit .   
A tightness that was n’t there in this moment .
Because I did n’t feel pain , I felt like I could do this .   
I could manage this because that almost - contact had shocked my system and my senses were altered in the now .   
That allowed me to show Amy .   
I could show Goddess because I trusted her .   
The others-
they knew or they ’d seen .
Well .   
Maybe they ’d seen , but it might have taken the damage to the floorboards to show them .
Adrenaline surged through me to impel , drive me forward , in a moment I was stiller than even a person standing could be .   
A person that stood needed to make micro - adjustments to their position , to keep their balance .   
Weight shifted from foot to foot .
Not so , for me .   
I could have been a corpse .
I saw moisture on her face that was n’t rain .   
Like the two and a half words she ’d spoken , it was almost enough to provoke me again .   
I felt outrage , seeing that .
I knew I was n’t being rational .   
I knew I was in shock .
Like with the master - stranger protocols , I had to recognize where I was , and what I needed to do .   
Things divorced from instinct , biological impulses , and baser needs , like fight or flight .
“
Did you get your closure ?
”
Goddess asked .
Amy turned her head to look at the woman , and I could see her eyes .   
Bewildered , haunted .   
Hurt .
Amy was n’t under Goddess’ influence .   
She was a lieutenant who had connections to key players like Tattletale , Marquis , and Teacher .
I ’d seen those eyes before too .   
Around the edges of memories that had been wiped away .
“
Amy , ” Goddess said .
Amy was n’t up to speaking any more than I was .
“ Go to Cryptid .   
You ’re useless to me here .
”
Amy nodded slowly .   
She backed away .
I had no idea if she planned to catch a ride somehow , run , walk , or do something else .   
I did n’t really care .   
She was leaving .   
She was gone .
She ’d tried to touch me .
What to call it when someone I was n’t prepared to forgive did something unforgivable ?
I was n’t sure .   
But I could cuss at myself in my head , for letting things get this far , for letting my guard down .   
A ‘ fool me once … ’ thing .
As the rush lost its hold on me , the shaking got a bit worse .
“ Natalie , ” Tristan said .   
“
Can you lock up ?   
Tress has trouble with things like keys , I do n’t think Lookout keeps keys readily available-
she has other things to do with her belt pouches .
”
“
Yeah , ” Lookout said .   
“
It ’s in my satchel .
”
The satchel was more like a fanny pack , worn at the back , strap extending diagonally over the right shoulder and around the left side of her ribcage .
“
And I do n’t want to go up and down the stairs in armor , ” Tristan said .
“
Okay , ” Natalie said .   
Tristan threw his keys to her- a small object thrown in the dark .   
By his accuracy more than anything , Natalie caught the keys .
And just like that , things were close to normal again .   
The shaking in my hands did n’t quite go away .
I saw Goddess raise one hand .   
The surface of the parking lot cracked , and in the lighting , streetlights and lights from the nearby building hitting the icy ground at an angle , it made the shift in the ground and the breaks in the ground stand out that much more .
She used her telekinesis to lift up a disc of ground from the parking lot , and as she did it , it was clear that the telekinesis had its own shape to it .   
Something geometric .
I ’d have to keep that in mind , like I had to keep Sveta ’s suit or Lookout
’s facial expressions in mind .   
Quirks and weaknesses .
Tristan approached .   
I could still see glimmers of that earlier anger .   
I was n’t sure exactly what was coming of it , though .   
To be that angry
and-
what ?   
No focus ?   
Was he burning it off or eating that anger and digesting it into some other form ?
It was too many question marks in a row , coinciding with the shaking of my hands .   
I hated feeling weak .   
I liked being the declarative sort , the one who could list off bullet points and elaborate on them , not get caught up in wonderings and doubts .
“ I get it , ” Tristan spoke .   
His voice was n’t his usual .   
“
The sibling thing .   
Wrestling with … with wrongs .
” I nodded .   
I could believe it .
“ Difference is , I was the wrongdoer , ” he said .   
“
The blood was on my hands .
”
He held out a gauntleted hand , where it could catch the light .   
Amy had tattoos .   
Tristan had metal that had been tinted orange - red , with a wash that let the tint collect in crevices and cracks .
“
I ’m going to need you to keep me in check , ” Tristan said .
“ Check ?
”
“
There are n’t many things that get to me , but we managed to press a few of those buttons tonight , ” Tristan murmured .   
“
The last few times I felt like this , I did things I was n’t proud of .
”
“
Got it .
”
“ Keep me from doing something stupid , and I ’ll have your back .   
Yeah ?
” I nodded .
Goddess lifted up her disc .   
With a gesture , she picked up Lookout by the satchel , then deposited her on the disc .   
Sveta accepted a hand of help from Tristan and I.
While we waited for Natalie , Tristan stood with his eyes on the group .   
Quiet , he stated a simple pass phrase .
“ Master - stranger ?
”
“
Yes , ” I said , barely audible .
“
Okay .   
I think I remember the rules .   
Who ’s our person ?
”
“ Natalie , ” I whispered .   
“ Until replaced .
”
“ Replaced ?
”
“ Byron was affected .
”
“ I felt it .   
Yes .
”
“
Then the first untainted , trustworthy cape we can find .   
We should keep them unaffected where possible , ” I whispered .
“ Crystalclear ?
”
“
Maybe .
”
The disc was ready .   
Tristan stepped up onto it , and then he offered a hand to Natalie , lifting her up with no apparent difficulty at all .
The disc levitated- a chunk of ground fifteen feet across
that rained a bit of gravel down on the ground far beneath .
I flew .   
Goddess landed at the midway point of the disc , and she lifted it , carrying herself with the rest .
Another thing to file away .   
She could lift herself , and she could lift a lot of weight , but in the here and now , she was using that power one at a time .
The rain did n’t let up , and being airborne did n’t help .   
There were less buildings to break up the flow of the wind , less sources of heat that could warm us up .   
My costume was covered in a thin sheet of ice before we were halfway to our destination .
Five minutes after that halfway point , my armor began to crack .   
The weight of the ice was its own downfall , and it came away in Victoria shapes , cascading down to empty streets below .
We reached the first portal and passed through .
The weather was different .   
The lighting from the now expired sunset , the sky bright even though it was night and it had been raining .
Eerily tranquil .
We approached the second portal in the airlock - like arrangement .   
Lookout deactivated the scrambler , and we had a clear shot through , the ability to see through the gate to the other side .
With that clear shot , we had a view as well .
The guards , their guns , and apparently prisoners that they ’d released to assist them .   
Capes standing at the edges of the group of correctional officers , ready to back them up .
The wave of telekinetic force that reached out struck at them one by one .
It had its own pattern , like a series of numbers that matched to the earlier pattern we ’d seen .   
It swiped over guards and it disarmed them of their weapons .
A moment later , like a fractal pattern cracking the wall before the shape took its form -a pattern not too unlike Tristan and Byron ’s power-
Goddess tore an entire wall out of the side of the building .   
People who had been standing ready to defend this place now scrambled to get clear .








When we were children and we were feeling insecure , we clung to the powerful authority figures in our lives .   
Mine had just torn down an interior wall of a prison .
It would be so easy to stop fighting .   
I was walking into a headwind , swimming upstream , alienating myself from my friend , doubts welling up inside me .   
Somewhere in all of this , I ’d almost killed someone I ’d grown up
with-
and I had less apprehension or regret about that near - murder than I did about momentarily meeting Capricorn ’s eyes , seeing him give me a small nod , as we flew and jogged forward .
We were the frontliners , each of us taking cover at different sides of the same hallway .    
Goddess walked down the center .   
She indicated one direction , and without words , Capricorn acted .   
Orange lights appeared in a swirl , and someone that was sprinting forward nearly stumbled into them .   
They scrambled back , ducking out of view .
Capricorn shouted a warning to them , and I barely heard it .
That I did n’t hear it told me a lot about how well I was processing things right now .
I could tell myself that for right now we would go after the one threat we felt unambiguous about , but thought and feeling both told me that I would feel just as wrong about betraying Goddess later on .
Goddess indicated my side .   
I pulsed out with my aura .   
I saw her react-
and I heard the people who ’d been approaching stop what they were doing , backing off .
I opened my mouth to apologize , and no words came out .
“
Do it again , ” Goddess’ voice cut through the noise .
Sure , I thought .   
I found my voice .   
“
Yes .
”
I hit her with my aura , soft at first , like a taste of fear in the mouth or a flash of something amazing in the eyes .
Her head moved , as if she was getting a sense for it .   
When I tapered it off , she moved her fingers in an almost absent beckoning gesture , like she wanted more .
She nodded all at once , definitive .
“
It wo n’t affect me now , ” she said .
I was n’t in a good place , and I could recognize that the inexplicable gratitude that welled up in me at hearing that was n’t good .
Focus , I thought .
We ’d been in this building before .   
It was shaped like a plus sign , with the intersection in the center being the place we ’d been held up , a heavily reinforced desk , including the gates we had to pass through .   
We ’d entered from the one corridor , and the corridor opposite opened into the prison itself .
Opened more since Goddess had taken that wall out .
Our current issue was the corridors off to the sides .   
They were apparently for staff , and prison employees had retreated off to either side .   
I looked back at Goddess , who had n’t advanced .
“
Deal with it , ” she said , without stepping forward .
She ’d have her reasons .
On our past visit , I ’d noted the shutters .   
The shutters were meant to be brought down from the other side , but … Capricorn was crouched in the corner by the wall that framed the metal detector and gate .   
Just past that short wall was the corner and the left turn to the corridor where staff had retreated .   
Prison officers , security .   
People with guns .   
I got his attention , then indicated the shutters , moving my hand to emulate the shutter coming down .
He gave me a nod of confirmation .   
I saw orange lights start to move along the ceiling .
I was crouched by the same wall on my side of the hallway .   
Behind me , Sveta , Natalie and Lookout were all gathered against the wall .   
Lookout was ignoring the situation and focusing on her phone .   
Her primary goal right now was in keeping the Warden and his deputy from accessing any computers to start detonating ankle bombs .   
Her secondary goal would be to keep an eye on what was going on .
She looked laser - focused on her task .   
I felt less like a cape than I had on my first night out in costume .
“ Tress , ” Goddess said .   
“
At the desk .   
Someone with a gun .
”
I barely had time to turn my head before Tress had sent her arms forward .   
She grabbed the sides of the metal detector , then slingshotted herself through it , straight at the window of the desk .   
The scrape that followed was sharp , suggesting she ’d scraped away some paint .   
The red light and the buzz of the metal detector was immediate , but she moved fast enough that it seemed like it followed too late .
I did n’t stay to watch .   
As off as I felt , I had to act .   
I flew up , hands and feet going up and back as I landed with my back to the ceiling , my extremities catching the impact and minimizing the sound .   
I flew while keeping as close to the ceiling as possible , cloth skimming across painted ceiling .   
I had a glimpse of the people in the hallway , crouched by short walls and benches like I ’d been crouched by the wall .   
The shutter and its mechanism provided some limited cover .   
The fact that the fluorescent lights focused on lighting the lower half of the room more than they focused on covering the ceiling helped .   
If anyone saw me and reacted , they did n’t shoot .
The Wretch struck the locking mechanism , disappearing an instant after it had appeared-
A violent image , the Wretch visible to me like it had been in the hospital room , except ghostly , existing only in the form of streaked raindroplets and rain breaking against an invisible surface .   
And beyond it-
Amy .   
Focus .
I worried I ’d have to haul it shut .   
I did n’t .   
The shutter
’s own weight brought it down , with my destruction of the mechanism serving much the same function as hauling down on any release lever or pressing any button would have .   
It was built like a garage door , but it was heavier , double or three times the thickness , and it was raucous , metal striking against the metal seat with a sound that would be heard next door .   
Most likely the intent .
Capricorn materialized his power , bringing down the other shutter , rock cracking as the metal moved and the individual slats bent .   
The impact was n’t as much of a metal on metal sound as it came down to its housing .   
He glanced at my shutter , then stood straighter for a better view .   
Orange lights began to move along the shutters , covering each surface .
Sveta .   
I flew down to the window , to check that she was fine .   
She was already at the window , peeking out .
“
It ’s fine , ” Goddess said .
I extended a hand for Sveta to take .   
Too late , as her prosthetic hands seized my wrist , I realized it was the burned one .   
It hurt , but I ignored it , pushing through it , as I helped pull her through .   
She found the positioning for her legs after they were through .
My arm buzzed and prickled with the pain even after Sveta let go .
Stupid mistake , and a mistake that bad could get us hurt .   
Focus , Victoria !
Goddess pushed down the additional barriers and barred walls that we would have had to be buzzed through .   
The group fell into step around her , the staff in the two side hallways effectively bunkered in .   
Capricorn made a gesture of his hand for effect .   
The orange motes became an additional wall of stone , flush against the metal shutters .   
It was very possible that it would make the shutters impossible to open until … Until after .
It was a cold shock to think about how we had to handle the after .   
We ’d just interfered with law enforcement , and the law was supposed to be one of my go - tos .
Follow the law , if that was n’t possible , do what was right .   
If that was n’t possible , we were supposed to reach out .
If I set that law aside- and I did n’t want to , but the situation was complicated , then I had other laws .   
In the morass of doubts and concerns , I had to get centered and focus again .   
I needed to put the events of twenty minutes ago behind me .   
Now that we were here , I could n’t be numb and unthinking like I ’d been on the flight in .
Black and white text .   
Protocols .   
Rules to be followed .   
Take all of the feelings and bottle them up , except those warm feelings of Dean , that give those protocols and stark letters their life .
Challenging each other , being competitive and trying to get the higher score .   
Getting in actual arguments over it , where we were both pissy the next day .   
Making up .   
Dean telling me , as we cuddled , that competitive was hard for him , because his dad expected so much , and he could sense his father ’s disappointment when he did n’t do his best .   
I ’d had such a distinct mental picture of Dean ’s dad standing in the doorway , because so often when I went over there with Dean , there would be that kind of distance .   
As if Dean and I being in one of their living rooms watching a show together meant the room was ours and his dad could n’t or would n’t intrude .   
I ’d been so able to imagine the disappointment and distance both .
My mind jumped from that to an image of Amy standing in a doorway in the same way .   
It-
My heart had already dropped .   
The warm memory was wiped away and replaced with a chilled , ugly feeling .   
I tried to reason my way through it , think around it .
It had n’t been when Dean and I were cuddling , but we ’d been together .   
Another time .   
Why had I connected that image to Amy ?   
The distance ?   
She had n’t been disappointed- or , no .   
Maybe she had , but I had n’t known it then .
The ugly feeling persisted .
Had I known ?   
Had there been some glimmer of a suspicion ?
It was n’t a rhetorical question or a revelation .   
Just … a very real question , where both answers were bad in their own way .
The ugly feeling got worse , as I dwelt on it .
I could n’t cling to that for strength , so long as other memories attached themselves .   
Both the times she ’d been there when I was with Dean and the times she had n’t been there when I ’d been with him were mucked in together , muddled and muddied , shat on by her proximity to them .   
That he ’d had to have known .   
That she could have saved him and she had n’t .
I could n’t .   
The kernel of love I felt for him was too hard to reach for .
Then-
then the other direction .   
Reaching for that other direction meant getting close , meant walking through a corridor of memories and ignoring the person who kept on peering in through the windows and stood off to the side , punctuating so , so much of my early life .
What was n’t hers ?
In the hospital room , studying like I ’d studied the master - stranger protocols .   
Being the powers geek with the patrol .   
Yes .   
It was an identity I could and had wrapped around myself like a security blanket .
Never hers .   
Untainted , but for a few intrusions looking in on Dean and I.
I was n’t moving any faster , walking in line with the others , my jaw set , but I felt like I was .
There was another identity , one from another world that had never been hers .    
It was a world that ’d had-
it had had its problems , but it was n’t hers .   
She ’d defied it , as a matter of fact .   
Where I ’d longed for it , thrown myself into that world
, she ’d run from it .   
She ’d wanted love and acceptance from our family , but she had n’t been able to bring herself to join in .
I reached for my mask , where it lay at my upper thigh , the curvature of the mask making for a neat fit .   
I slipped it on , hooking it to the metalwork where my hood met my hairline , a band of chain going around the back , securing it in place .   
It clicked in a satisfying way .
I wore a face , my face , but it was cast in alloy , untouchable , unmoving .
My breath was warm against my face as we stepped beyond the corridor , through the wholly unnecessary if impressive opening Goddess had made .
The sky was so bright , and it was warm .   
There was only a sliver of sun , but after the darkness and the rain , the harsh coldness , the setting was eerie .   
Less of a crossing over to another Earth and more of a crossing over to another world .
And there were guards .   
The long distances and the open spaces with only chain link blocking off access meant that getting from A to B was more time consuming , and that was a dangerous thing when anyone with a gun had an open shot , often with next to nothing on the far side of us , the targets .
Capricorn began drawing out orange - red motes , clearly intending to give us some cover .
Goddess beat him to it .   
With a sweep of her arm , she used her telekinesis to carve a great furrow into the earth .   
Dust and dirt was sent flying , and there was a great opaque cloud .   
Again , in the moment I saw the earth react , before the dust cloud covered it , I saw the pattern by which Goddess’ telekinesis touched the world , like a hand used to push would leave a handprint .   
A line that zig - zagged out , back into itself , out .   
The first gunshots erupted , the sounds louder because they could skip off the flat ground like a stone could skip on water .   
Our group ducked down , and I put the Wretch out , shielding Sveta , Kenzie , and Natalie .
The dust was clearing , however .   
Goddess had pushed out the earth , and where it had piled up , it formed a loose general barrier , thick with stones .
Goddess’ head snapped around .   
She reached out , and part of her barrier exploded outward , stones and dirt flying .
“
Do n’t hurt them !
” I said .   
My voice was almost drowned out by the follow - up strike .   
Something more localized .   
Taking out one person who was still after her , following the initial strike .
“
Hurt-
you hurt the guards ?
” Sveta asked .
“ Maybe they were bad people , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Right ?
”
“
Would you rather be shot by them ?
”
Goddess asked , ignoring Kenzie .
“ We have to live with the consequences after , ” I said .   
“
We can do this in a good way .
”
“ One moment , ” she said .   
She paused .
I clenched my teeth , lips pressed together behind my mask .
Four hundred feet away , at one corner of a building , brick and glass shattered , a window and balcony coming to pieces .   
From what I could see of the follow - up , a series of blasts and destruction within the room she had targeted , she was removing the floor from the room .
“
That-
” I started .
“
A moment , ” she interrupted , firmer .   
Her focus was wholly on that spot .   
There was a pause .   
“
One fucking moment .
” I remained silent , letting her do what she needed to do .   
She turned her head slowly , looking around .
“
There was a sniper .   
There ’s one more on the other side of the complex .   
They ’re not taking a shot .   
They ’re too far .
”
With a finger , she indicated a building .
“ Girls’ side , ” Kenzie said .
“ The men and women have fled .   
Retreating to a fortified position .
”
“
I could spot them on my phone , ” Lookout offered , helpfully .
“
No , ” Goddess said .   
“
It ’s not a question .   
I ’m saying it because I know it .
”
“
Oh , cool , ” Lookout said .
Goddess indicated the nearest building on the boy ’s side .   
“
You ’ll escort me .   
Teacher ’s pawns are close , and they were picked to stop me .
”
“ Is that the plan ?
” I asked .   
“ Visiting each building in turn ?   
Rounding up the capes , dispatch the guards and anyone Teacher set up ?
”
“
Why does it sound like you ’re questioning me ?
” I hesitated .
I am Antares .   
I am a scholar of powers , I was born to capes and raised to be a cape .   
I- I reached , grasping for the strength to push through my doubts .   
Me with my mom and dad .   
A weird scene , because I had been young , and I ’d had a debate with my parents while we ’d been out in costume , and I ’d been thrown off balance .
I did n’t have time to replay the whole memory in my head .
“
Yes , ” I said .   
The fuller answer found me as I grasped the rest of the memory .   
The debate with my parents had thrown me off because they ’d talked to me like equals , had considered my opinion valid , conceded points , or defended them .   
“
You wanted people close to you who were n’t just yes men .   
It ’s why you had-
you had Amy , who you were n’t
…
” I trailed off .   
Bringing up Amy had slowed my momentum .   
Trying to find a word to encapsulate this killed it .
“ Aligning ? ”
Lookout offered .   
“
Inviting to the coolest cool kids club ?   
Except we ’re not all kids , um- ”
“
Aligning , ” I said .   
“ Thank you for the word , Lookout .
”
“ Anytime .
”
“ I did , ” Goddess told me .   
She turned her head , looking for something .   
“ I do n’t like standing in this open field , when we do n’t know what Teacher has prepared .   
We ’ll walk to our destination .
” I nodded .
Capricorn created barriers to one side of us , as Goddess watched over her shoulder in the same direction .   
Natalie looked scared-
it might have been the passing mention of a sniper .
“
You wanted people who debate with you , offer differing points of view .   
You listened to Cryptid , so … is it okay if I bring up some points ?
”
“ Cryptid may not be your best example , Antares , ” Goddess said .
There was something ominous in her voice as she said it , even though she looked at me and smiled like there was almost a joke in there .
“ I do n’t understand .
”
“ He came to me with a form prepared to counter me .   
And that is , as far as I detected , only one of three levels of deception that boy was putting into practice .   
You do n’t want to tell me that you ’re following his suit .
”
I was n’t sure most members of the team were n’t shocked at that .   
Looks were exchanged .   
Of alarm , concern .
“
But he ’s helping you , ” Lookout said .
“ He is .   
He ’s clever enough that I want to work with him .   
Antares , little Lookout , is a little more blunt about questioning me and making me wonder about her , and she already attacked one of my new lieutenants .   
Did you have an actual argument , Antares , or are we going to talk about him ?   
Because if you did n’t have a problem to raise , I wo n’t be happy you questioned me .
”
“
Actual argument , ” I said .   
It took me a half - second to refocus myself , taking my thoughts away from Chris and back into thinking like a cape , the kind of cape that could debate approaches with my parents .   
“
The assistant warden of this prison is on our side , and he ’s holding off on detonating the ankle bombs because Foresight convinced him .   
He ’s presumably watching through surveillance cameras- ”
“ He is , ” Lookout said , looking around .   
She sounded alarmed as she said ,    “
Nobody said I should stop him from doing it .
”
“
It ’s good ,
” I told her , reassuring .   
“
It ’s good .   
If you stopped him , he might start panicking and doubting Foresight .   
But if this group with a strange person in it starts assaulting his guards and collecting his prisoners …
”
“
He ’s going to shit a brick , use that brick to break the glass , and hit the big red button that blows up those prisoners , ” Capricorn supplied .
“
Can you block him like you ’re blocking the warden ?
”
Goddess asked Lookout .   
“
Do n’t actually do it .   
I had a feeling as I asked .
”
“ I could , ” Lookout said .   
“
But it ’d be hard .   
I ’m already splitting my focus , and unless I want to shut off all power across the complex … ”
“ Leaving us in the dark , ” Sveta murmured .   
Her pale face turned to look in the direction of the sun .   
No longer a sliver-
it was a glow across the sky .   
The ‘ slivers’ were now only the crimson - purple linings around some of the rare clouds at that end of the sky .
We ’d reached the building .   
It was the same one the sniper had been in .   
It was less like a proper apartment building and more like six cargo containers organized so it was two side by side ,
another two stacked facing a different direction , and then two stacked at the top , with the original orientation .   
Staircases that led down or through were exposed .
Rain and Ashley
’s buildings had four people per .   
This is a six .   
It ’s almost like a threat rating , but the buildings with six have the easiest prisoners to manage .
We were n’t going inside just yet .   
Goddess was hesitating .
“ I think I know why .   
If she does that then we become the bad guys , ” I said .   
“ Foresight will find out or think something ’s going on-
they have good thinkers .   
Right now they ’re telling him that his staff and superiors are compromised , something dangerous is going on .   
He ’s listening .   
We do n’t want to give him a reason to think he ’s being played .
”
“ Then we go after him .   
Tress , if I tell you to go to him and keep him quiet and cooperative , can you do that ?
”
“ I do n’t know if I ’m that convincing .
”
“ You might not be , but a knife to the throat is , ” Goddess said .
I saw Tress’ expression shift .   
Hesitation .
“
Is anyone else capable ?
”
“ I could try , ” Lookout offered .
“
You could n’t be older than twelve , and I need better than try , ” Goddess said .   
She looked in the direction of the entry - building .   
“ Trouble ’s coming .   
It feels like Teacher .
”
“ It might be , ” Lookout said .   
“
Let me look .
”
She turned to her phone .   
I turned my focus to the immediate problem .   
We had to protect the leadership .
“ If we grab everyone , they ’ll panic and you ’ll get nobody , ” I said .   
“
We told Foresight we ’d reach out to our team members and their undercovers .   
They ’ll let the guy in admin know .   
Let ’s get our forces together .
”
“
Teacher realized he ca n’t get in , ” Lookout reported .   
“
He could ’ve figured it out if he ’d tried to make a portal a hundred feet in the air , but I guess he ’s not that smart .   
Like , helloo …
”
“
He ’s attacking the front door , ” Goddess interrupted .
“
Yes , ” Lookout said .   
“ I was getting around to that .
”
“
Our guys ?
” I asked .
“ The teams we pulled together are going to be holding him off .   
Fume Hood , A.G. , Auzure , ” Lookout said .   
“ And others .
”
“ They wo n’t succeed , ” Goddess said .   
“ I would n’t be aware of the imminent danger if he was going to be scared away .
”
“
Then tell them , Lookout , ” I said .   
“
Let ’s not have them commit to a fight they ca n’t win .
”
“ I ’ll tell them .
”
“
Get your people , ” Goddess said .   
“
Lookout and the unpowered girl stay with me .   
The rest of you- gather your forces .   
I do n’t care how you do it , but do it fast .   
You know Teacher ’s key players ?
”
“
Yes , ” Capricorn said .
“ We ’re doing what I did when I claimed my Earth .   
Start from the top .   
A prison warden has to be easier than a collection of world leaders .   
You can manage this ?   
Remove Teacher ’s pawns , that would give him control .
”
“ Would help , ” Lookout said , her attention back on her phone .   
“
I ’m spending half my time
keeping these guys hemmed in , now that they ’ve split up .   
They ’re gathering guards too .
”
We do n’t know what Teacher ’s people are going to do .   
They could blow up everyone not on his shortlist , and that could include Ashley and Rain .   
It could include Crystalclear and Foresight ’s other people .   
Or they might do something that is n’t using the ankle bombs .
“
We can manage , ” I said .
“
Um , here , ” Lookout said .   
She had her bag slung over her back , and she retrieved one of the projection discs .   
“
It ’s kind of broken since last time .   
But it has enough charge to draw lines .   
It ’s hooked up to the computer at home ,
the surveillance- ”
“
Short version , ” Goddess sounded testy .
“ Points at people !
”
Lookout said .
“
Good ! ”
Capricorn answered her , before bumping her shoulder with one fist .   
She laughed in response , but we were already heading away .   
Further into the prison complex .
I did glance over my shoulder at Natalie though .
She ’d been silent , quiet .   
What was she thinking or doing ?   
Did she have a plan ?
If she just looked after Lookout ’s welfare , I would be happy .   
But there was a chance that would n’t be enough .   
There was a good chance that we needed more than that .   
Master - stranger protocols .   
We needed one level head in our group .
Fifty or sixty eyes were at windows , staring down at us .   
We were in the sixes , the buildings with six ‘ apartments’ each , where the minimum risk prisoners were .   
There were n’t many .   
The fours were more numerous .   
More dangerous prisoners who were deemed cooperative enough to have full privileges .
Sveta , Capricorn and I jogged .
“ Rain and Crystalclear first , ” Capricorn said .   
The disc he held had lines extending from it , and some of those lines lit up .
“
Yes , ” I said .
“
I ca n’t figure you out , Victoria , ” Sveta murmured .
“ Master - stranger protocols , ” Capricorn said .
Sveta looked at him , “
What ? ”
“ Master - stranger , ” I said .   
“
We ’re under the influence of a power .   
We ca n’t trust our own judgment .
”
“
And you ’re on board with this , Capricorn ?
” she asked .   
“
You ’re okay with this ?
”
“
Do you trust me ?
” he asked .
“ Not like this !
” she exclaimed , stopping in her tracks .
“
Do you trust me ?
” he asked again .   
“ Forgetting this specific situation
, do you trust me ?
”
“
It ’s more nuanced than that .
”
“
Do you trust me ?
”
“
Stop that .   
Do n’t play your games with me , Capricorn .
”
“ Do you-
”
“
Yes !
” she shouted .   
There was a pause as she gathered her composure .
In that pause , the jeering and shouts from prisoners was audible .   
Catcalling , threats .   
Offers to get us money if we let them out .
“
Most of the time , ” Sveta added , more subdued .
“
Do you trust Antares ?
”
“
Most of the time , ” Sveta said .   
She looked at me .   
“
Yes .
”
“
Do you trust Weld ?
”
“ What does Weld have to do with this ?
”
“
The protocols we ’re talking about are Ward and Protectorate protocols .   
If Weld was here he would be following the rules too .   
Do you trust Weld ?   
Do you believe in the Weld fan club ?
”
“
That is the most manipulative shit , Capricorn .
”
“ If you do n’t answer with a resounding
yes , I think I win .
”
“
Fuck you , no you do n’t , and yes , of course I believe in my boyfriend , but bringing him up is a stretch .
”
“
Sometimes our feelings get screwed up .   
I ’ve had to deal with it before , ” I said .   
“
You know that .
”
“
Yes , ” Sveta said .
“
The rules for the protocols are simple .   
We listen to the people we can be sure are n’t affected .
”
“
And you are n’t affected ?
”
“ We ’re all affected , ” Capricorn said .   
“
Me , my brother , Antares , the kids .
”
“ Only Natalie ?
” Sveta asked .   
“
She did n’t say anything .
”
“ I think she thinks that if she ’s quiet she could get an opportunity to make a phone call or reach out , ” Capricorn said .   
“
And I do n’t think Goddess is that stupid , to let her .
”
“ I do n’t know , ” Sveta said .
“ Trust us , trust in the rules Weld would have followed .   
Because they ’re the guidelines of effective heroes .
”
“ Do the guidelines say how we handle this situation ?
” Sveta asked .   
“ Teacher ’s attacking , he ’s focusing his efforts on the front door .   
Goddess is … she wants to fight him here , and we ’re supposed to help her .   
This is going to become a battlefield , and … ” “
And a single mistake could mean our friends lose their lives , or dangerous prisoners get free ,
” I finished .
“ Or
Teacher wins , ” Capricorn said .   
“ If he forces us into a retreat or captures us-
”
There was a sharp whistle nearby that stood out from the lecherous ones one guy in particular seemed to be doing .   
I turned my head , searching for the source .
A prisoner , standing at a balcony , where he had to look around the corner and along the length of a building to see us .   
He was a black guy , with tattoos outlined across his face and arms that looked like they had been put on his skin with white - out .   
He pointed down , and he held up his hand .
I could n’t tell if his thumb was out , at that distance , but it sure looked like he had all four fingers up .
I saluted him .
“ We ’ve got company .   
Officers , I ’m guessing , ” I said .
“ We run , instead of fighting , ” Capricorn decided .   
I nodded my agreement .
Capricorn created cover , orange motes tracing out walls , which appeared just as we reached them .   
I flew alongside , the Wretch active .   
What the walls did n’t cover , I hoped Capricorn ’s setup would .
Which was fine , so long as we just had the one squadron of officers coming from around the back corner of the building .   
One squadron , one direction to watch , all good .
But there were others .   
We approached the building that Lookout ’s compass was pointing us to , and I could see the broken window on the ground floor , with no less than four officers lined up along it , guns pointed out .
I had to push hard to fly out in front , my arms outstretched wide and Wretch stretched out wider .   
A momentary stop , working on the assumption the bullets would be accurate , turning to face one direction while flying the opposite , in an effort to confuse-
The Wretch caught a bullet .   
In the moment the Wretch was gone , so soon after that I imagined it would have been blocked by the Wretch had it been a tenth of a second faster , Sveta grabbed me by the cloth at the small of my back .   
She was already pulling herself to a destination , and in the process , she pulled me too .
I went high , because I could , and because I knew the people shooting at us would n’t be aiming that high with their initial battery .   
For a moment , I was kind of Sveta ’s kite .
We did n’t get away unscathed .   
Each of those four officers fired off multiple shots .   
I saw bullets hit my teammates .   
I saw Capricorn fall in the wake of one shot .
Metal prosthetic body- not all that durable , with the lightweight metals .   
As Sveta collapsed into a heap , the three of us stopping at the base of one building .   
In the moment we passed through some of the light that reached down past the rectangle of a balcony , I could see the groove in Sveta ’s body .   
It looked more like someone had buried a hatchet in her side than anything .
And Capricorn- he crawled to the base of the wall , sitting up , before twisting his leg around .   
It looked like his armor was up to snuff .   
Whatever it was made of was denser , and it had n’t parted or let the bullet through when it had taken the grazing shot .   
Maybe a deflection , maybe a graze .
“
All good ?
”
I asked Sveta .   
“
No damage ?
”
“
Nothing I can tell , ” she murmured .   
“
Get me a patch ?   
At my back , actually only a short distance from the damage done .   
I ’ll try not to grab you .
”
I found the patch .   
I had to fumble with it , finding the way it attached .   
There was a part that went inside the armor , inside the damaged portion- Sveta grabbed it from within , pulling it flush against the armor .   
“
I think I ’ve got it .   
Thanks .
” I nodded .
Capricorn leaned out to peer around the corner .   
There was a gunshot , and he pulled his head back .
“ Night vision goggles or something , ” Capricorn said .   
He looked around .   
“
It ’s too dark for them to see me , normally .
”
I glanced up at the sky .   
The sun had set .   
No light from above that was n’t from the moon , and we were n’t near any cities .   
The only light pollution was from the prison complex .
“
Guys who were behind us are going to catch up with us , ” I said .   
“ If I was willing to hurt these guys , I would .
”
“ Patched , ” Sveta said .   
“
So long as I do n’t pick at the wires .
”
Capricorn looked out .   
Another bullet made him pull his head in .
“
Stop doing that , you ’re making me nervous , ” Sveta said .
“ I guess our assistant warden is n’t telling all his men to stand down , ” Capricorn said .   
“ Antares , you ’ve got-
”
Something landed on the ground near us .
Trash ?
No , not just trash .   
An adult diaper .   
Used .
I craned my head up to look , saw a wide - mouthed , wild - haired face peering down , and took flight , flying up toward them .
They shrieked , and then slammed their balcony door closed .
I lowered myself to the ground .   
Capricorn had already dealt with the diaper , burying it in a pyramid of stone .
“
Get my phone ?
”
Capricorn asked .   
“
I ’m wearing gauntlets .
”
He indicated where , and I reached for it .
He moved it to the edge of the building , so that only the camera peeked out , and looked at the screen .   
The night - vision mode was n’t great , but even looking over Capricorn ’s shoulder , I could see the general shape of the building .
I could also see the bright spots that were his sparks .   
He was using the camera to help place them .
I kept an eye out for our pursuers at our rear .   
In a prison complex that was inconsistently lit , we were now sitting in the shadows just beside the illumination that came down from diaper - man ’s balcony light .
No , nothing was that easy .   
I could see the first hints of flashlights mounted on guns .
“
Hey Lookout , ” I murmured .   
“ Since you ’re messing around with power and systems , if you happened to want to throw these guys for a loop … ” The lights went out around the pursuers .
“
Uh , ” I said .
“
Coincidence , ” Sveta said .
“
Blocking the window , ” Capricorn whispered .   
“
We blitz .   
Go in three , two , one !
”
We rounded the corner .   
A wall of rock blocked the window .
The door near them opened .   
Sveta reached out , missed the knob , threw out another hand , and caught it .   
She shifted her stance and hauled the door shut .
A gun fired from within .   
The door handle came away .
Sveta , halfway to reeling her arm in , whipped it .   
It reversed direction , extending in the direction of the hole .
She grabbed someone or something on the other side and yanked .   
They collided with the edge of the opening door , which promptly slammed .   
It was only a moment later , and after seeing Sveta ’s expression , that I remembered the height that the usual doorknob was at , and what she might have grabbed .
The guards shot out the hinges , and at that point , there was no keeping the door up .   
I flew to intercept , and as I saw their movements as they turned to track me , I shifted course , flying up .   
With the Wretch active , I hit the ceiling just above the door , where the light was .
We still have pursuers from behind .
“ We ’ve got two red lines from the compass !
”
Capricorn called out .
Red line ?
I flew back and away , so I ’d have a second to think .   
I was in the middle of evasive maneuvers when a bullet hit the Wretch .
Changing course , I put myself close to the building , so the overhang above the door would provide some cover from the shooter .
They shot elsewhere .
“
Stop shooting my body !
”
Sveta called out , arms up in front of her face .
I flew straight down .   
Wretch out , flat out , all out .   
A full speed descent , a downward swipe of the Wretch aimed at the concrete pad that the building was seated on .
The pad shattered .   
People all around me stumbled- shadowy silhouettes in more shadow .
I swung backhanded , aiming a punch with no enhanced strength active , but with my aura going from zero to ten .
A hand deflected my swing .   
The woman stepped in close , with an underhanded punch .   
The first hit my breastplate .   
The second , same hand , hit my side , where the breastplate did n’t protect me .
People were cowering , backing up , but this person did n’t flinch .
And the one with the gun was n’t either .   
They brought their weapon around , aimed at my head .
I ducked right , relying on flight to keep me moving , when otherwise it would have been me landing on my side .   
At the same instant , Sveta had a grip on the gunman and pulled them away , hauling back on the torso , not the gun - arm .   
And , still also in the same moment , they fired .
With me moving one way , and Sveta pulling the gunman the other way , the bullet still clipped the edge of my mask just by the left eyehole .   
My head was twisted to the left , pain singing in my neck in a way that promised I ’d ache tomorrow .
And the martial artist woman in the prison guard uniform was after me .   
Her body was a blur of grays and blacks against a black background , and I barely saw her leg come around .   
A kick aimed at my neck , while I was still reeling .
Teacher thrall , I realized .   
I brought the Wretch out .   
She kicked the Wretch , and the Wretch might have been lashing out or growing out in her direction , because I saw and felt her leg break .
She landed on the three intact limbs , centered herself , and then pounced at me .
“
The hell ?
” another officer asked .
“ You ’ve got moles !
” I shouted .   
“
It ’s why we ’re here !
”
The gunman was maneuvering to get a shot , his focus on Sveta again .   
The second teacher thrall .   
The night vision sniper Capricorn had remarked on was n’t using night vision .   
They had something else going on , courtesy of Teacher
’s gifts .
And they were dead inside enough that my emotion power was n’t affecting them .
Capricorn closed the distance with the gunman .   
Sveta grabbed the pouncer .
The Wretch ’s first hit was deflected , but only barely- the woman was hit hard enough that she was pulled from Sveta ’s grip .   
She did n’t have a second leg to catch herself on , so she wobbled unsteadily as she dropped to a one - legged squat , put her hands out to either side , and then sprung forward at me yet again .
I ducked low , using flight to orient myself , and kicked out .   
She was ready for it , pulling her leg up out of the way-
but the broken leg that dangled was n’t so adroit .   
I ’d kicked it , hard , and as dead as she was inside , she seemed to feel sufficient pain or shock .   
She landed hard across broken concrete .
“
Hey !   
Stop !
” one guard shouted .
Capricorn had been punching the gunman , his gauntleted fist coming back from what could n’t have been the first hit , starting to move in for a third or fourth .
He stopped himself .   
When he let the guy fall , the guy fell limp , unconscious .
His head lowered , fists clenching .
“
Ca n’t stop , ” I said .   
“ We ’ve got more coming .
”
There were others in the incoming squad .   
Capricorn looked down at the compass .   
I saw two more red lines .
Teachered people that Lookout had noted and marked in her system .
Fuck me .
“
Two of these guys are compromised too ,
” Capricorn said , more for the benefit of the other guards .
There was an eruption .   
The incoming squad was scattered , various members thrown in every theoretical direction .
Rain and Crystalclear leaped from a higher point .   
Rain stopped them mid - fall , then let them fall the rest of the way .
“ We ’re clear ?   
I ’m not going to blow up ?
”
Rain asked .
“
You ’re clear , ” I said , before raising my voice .   
“
The rest of you who ’re listening are n’t , by the way !
”
“
What the fuck ! ?
” a guy on a balcony shouted down .   
“
What ’s going on ! ?
”
We ignored him .   
My phone was buzzing , and the ‘ compass’ that was the projector disc showing headings of various threats that surveillance had spotted was lighting up .   
One big magenta line , then another , and another .   
Red lines were converging .
“
I ’m really hoping we can close the portal if we need to , ” I said , because I ’m going to guess that those magenta lines are … bigger threats .
”
“
The people at the gates , ” Sveta said .   
She was working on patching her body where she ’d taken bullets .   
“ Powered people .
”
“
No sweat .   
We ’ve got the Lady in Blue , ” Rain said , smiling .
“
Yeahhhh , ” Crystalclear said , sounding very unsure .   
“
Hey , how are we feeling about that ?   
Because things are looking odd to me here , cracks in places there should n’t be cracks .
”
His vision .
“
We ’re feeling master - stranger protocols ?
”
I tried , with a note of hope , wincing a little at the same time .
“
I ’m not up to date on my protocols , ” Crystalclear said .
I sighed .
“ Things are screwed up , ” Sveta said .
“
Okay , it ’s not just me then , ” Crystalclear said , sounding relieved .   
I was n’t sure he ’d sound as relieved if he had the full story .
I pulled my phone free .   
My side hurt like a bitch where I ’d been punched .   
Hit - in - the - organs hurt .
But that hurt was almost welcome .   
Hurt was part and parcel of wearing the costume , being in that zone of being a cape .   
It was me not being Victoria , for just a little while .
A different headspace .   
One of two safe refuges .
And … looking at my phone , I could see that I might need to tap the other- the powers scholar .
Kenzie had surveillance footage , looping between a few isolated clips because the people entering the prison now were destroying the cameras as they came across them , and one of those people was making cameras twist on their mounts to look away .
That would be Blindside .   
I was pretty sure that another one was Kingdom Come .   
The same guy I ’d seen blow up … he must have reconstituted .
And they had a leader .   
These squads liked to have a big bad brute in charge , and these guys had picked one I knew well .   
Hometown brute , already growing in metal scales that punched through tattooed skin .
Fucking Lung .   
Fuck him .
They were n’t alone .
I showed Tristan and Sveta , before turning the camera around for Crystalclear and Rain to see .
As the focus shifted away , my vision remained on Capricorn .   
He ’d wrapped up ‘ cuffing’ the compass - marked threats .   
His hand was shaking , and he seemed to be trying to settle down .   
There was still blood on the gauntlet .
“
Let ’s get moving .   
We ’ve got to get Swansong and whoever Foresight sent to that side .
”
“
Ah geez , ” Crystalclear said .








A droplet of blood fell from Capricorn ’s gauntlet .   
Amid the patchwork of glare and deep shadow that illuminated the prison , this droplet fell while he jogged through the light .   
I was hyperalert enough that it caught my eye , and it struck enough nerves to stay with me for far too long after the fact .
I was flying , which gave me some ability to twist around and rotate in the air .   
I ’d been glancing to one side , checking our flank , but in the aftermath of seeing that droplet , I found myself flying backward , looking back toward the group rather than out ahead of us .   
It took Sveta meeting my eyes and a few simultaneous glances from the others to bring me back to reality .
Weird that she was talking to Rain like she was .   
Did I need to worry ?   
I felt like Capricorn
and I were more on the same page- Worrisome given the blood and the flare of temper .   
Me back at the hideout .   
Him just now , with that Teachered Officer .
-But
Rain and Sveta seemed a lot cooler about Goddess , and the protocols of proper caping were far less ingrained in them .
Tristan was talking to them about Goddess .   
About trusting protocols .   
The blind led the blind .
I wanted my own blind self to join in , but I did n’t trust myself to string coherent thoughts together .
Battle mode , Victoria .
Thinking about the ingrained things helped .
How many nights had the teenaged me gone out in costume ?   
White costume with the dress and the skintight shorts beneath for modesty , gloves , knee - high boots , short cape , my tiara with its spikes radiating out .   
That was physical .   
I ’d stretch , check on any injuries from the night before , adjusting my costume to cover any hints that I was n’t invulnerable , and then I ’d be out the door , running first and then flying .   
All of that was the physical , the external .
Internally , it was excitement , anticipation , reminding myself of all of Mom ’s little tricks about how to present oneself when out in costume .   
I would be thinking about the recent crime maps , the online listings of last known sightings by villains , and
mom and dad ’s rules for my costumed activities .
The lines blurred at times , but it was very much a role I wrapped around myself , past and present .   
A mode .
It had n’t been that long ago that hands tattooed in red , black , and gold reached out for me in a place I ’d thought safe and mine .   
I was shaken .   
I remained shaken enough that a droplet of red threatened to bring me back to that wretched place where Sveta had been forced to grab me and stop me .
But routine left its- its scars , I supposed , even though I did n’t think of them as bad scars .   
It was n’t just the bad experiences that left their mark .   
A route walked through the wilderness enough times became a dirt path , a scar through nature .   
Cities were harder to alter , but a cape or team of capes making an area part of their regular routine changed that area .   
A pair of gloves and knee - high boots could be washed and worn enough times that they came to fit perfectly .   
Scars and marks , impressions .   
Impressions had been the idea I ’d been searching for , and I was glad to have it .
I had to be able to do this .   
I had to find that worn path , that image that I could wear as comfortably as any pair of gloves .   
I had to be able to settle into that mindset .
Any alternative to being functional was not okay .   
Not for right this moment , with so many people counting on us .   
Not for the long term , when it meant I might have nothing at all in the aftermath .
There were too many Welds , Crystals , Vistas and Major Malfunctions out there .   
Too many Jaspers , Gilpatricks , Yamadas , Natalies , and Darnalls .
A droplet of red , blood red fingers .
I pushed the image out of my head .   
There was a desperate edge to my thoughts as I forced myself back on track .   
Into that well - trodden mindset .
The head office of the prison and many of the administration buildings were toward the south end of the complex , with the yard situated at the middle - south , minimizing travel time from any of the cell block apartments .   
Those in the higher security cells to the north had to walk further , but I had to imagine they did n’t get yard time or they got less .   
Either way , we had two options , only one of which was a good option .   
The bad option was to head south , loop around the bottom , and make our way to the women ’s half of the prison .   
That route put us closer to the prison entrance , where Lung currently was .
We would have to deal with that , with   him , but not now .   
I was happy procrastinating on that particular encounter .
“ Rain !
”
I heard the voice .   
It was higher , but it was from the guy ’s side of the prison .   
“ Crystalclear .
”
The voice came from one of the apartment buildings near Rain ’s .   
I flew up for a better view , and saw the man at the window .   
He was heavy , with the kind of double chin that hung over his collarbone .   
He had wiry stubble , and there was n’t much helping to distinguish the end of the facial hair and the start of body hair .   
His hair was short and uneven , and it was greasy , which made the uneven spikes that much more noticeable .
Most notable was his mouth .   
He looked like he had chewed on an ink packet .   
His teeth were yellow - white , but the spaces between them , the lines around his mouth and his tongue were all black .
Coalbelcher .
“ … and a villainess ?   
Heroine ?
”
“ Heroine .
”
He gave me an up - down look that made my skin crawl .   
Still staring at me , he called down .   
“
How are you out , boys ?   
What ’s this commotion about ?   
I ’m
offended you interrupted my motherfucking meal , and I ’m more offended you ’re running around with two legs .
”
“ Special dispensation , since we used to be heroes , ” Rain said .   
“
Two masters are fighting over who gets to take over the prison , deactivate the ankle bombs and recruit everyone inside .
”
“
Yeah ?   
Are we hoping they win ?
”
“ One of them , maybe , ” Rain said .
“
Neither of them , ” Crystalclear said , loud enough to be heard from the second floor .   
At a more regular volume , he said , “ I think your judgment is n’t that good right now , Rain .
”
“
Neither , ” I echoed Crystalclear , not sure I sounded like I believed it .
Crystalclear moved his arm , pointing , and Coalbelcher leaned over the railing to see him better .   
While the prison boss was n’t looking , I gave Cyrstalclear a slight nod .
The others hurried on their way .   
I saw Coalbelcher practically twitch , seeing them leave without a goodbye .   
He was the boss of the men ’s side , and he ’d been ignored .
I could afford to stay .   
I had to think about the future , consider options .   
If we pissed this guy off , we could win today and see Rain suffer for it tomorrow .   
“ They have to run .   
Time ’s critical , and the guards are coming .   
We do n’t know which of them we can trust .
”
“
Hm .   
I could be useful there .   
What do ya think about getting me some of that special dispensation ?
”
Coalbelcher asked .   
He licked his fingers , then smudged the black spit around one eye .   
It looked more like grainy black paint than anything .
“ I have trouble believing you were a hero , ” I said .
His fingers dragged slowly down one cheek , smearing black there .   
Between the black eye socket and the cheek , it was the initial steps toward a skull face .
“
A lot of trouble , ” I said .   
“ If you try to leave , they ’ll take your leg .   
Sorry .
”
“
You sure ?   
I said I can be useful , and I see fires over there , ” he said .   
He pointed in the direction of the prison entrance .   
There was a diffuse orange glow .   
“
I love fire .   
Maybe I save lives if that gets out of control .
”
With guys like this , it was all about respect .   
It was hard , though , when nothing about his appearance merited it , and his vaguely lecherous approach shattered what little I was able to sum up .   
Still …
“
Our old teammate talked you up .   
He said you were the guy in charge , and we could use some of that to keep the prisoners under control if things get hairy .   
Would if I could , Coalbelcher .
”
“
Find a way , yeh ?
”
That kind of order felt vaguely like a threat .   
I was n’t sure how to respond , so I simply nodded , then flew after the others .
A part of me had hoped for reasonable from the guy .   
I was n’t sure if I ’d made anything better , but I was n’t sure I ’d made it any worse either .   
Rain and Crystalclear running without saying goodbye had put the guy in a worse mood , but I was n’t sure anything short of being part of the action would have put him in a good mood .   
I ’d tried , I ’d left a door open .
It would have to do .
Rain had used his blades to cut through the fence and the wall separating the two halves of the prison , and the group was through .   
Halogen lights were on and being manually operated , and the lights roved across the prison complex .   
I saw one start to move in the direction of the group and the hole in the wall , and I flew in that direction to intercept .   
If they had rifles-
The light stopped moving , then turned in the direction of the front gate , panning over the empty yard , over a group of officers who were hunkered down by a building , and then casting a light on the distant scene where , presumably , Lung was engaged in a fight .
I flew closer , just to double check it would n’t spin around , and I saw Sveta perched on the fence by the light .   
I stopped short when I saw the disjointed tentacles poised around her .
“
It ’s okay , ” she said .   
My eyes were adjusting to the gloom , but the adjustment to seeing her face was helped by the fact her face was as pale as it was .   
I could see the black tendrils at her face and around her battle damage .   
“
These are courtesy of Rain .
”
It was what he ’d been talking to her about on the ground .
The ‘ tentacles’ were arm segments , repeated over and over .   
Black tendrils snaked through the connecting mesh , but did n’t snake out , which was the important part .
“
Is it fragile ?
” I asked .
“
No .   
Maybe .
”
“
Are you okay with it ?
”
“ I want to be useful .   
I do n’t have to be human - shaped .
”
“ You want to be human shaped .
”
“
Yeah .   
I guess that ’s something Sveta gets , but Tress will have to put it off if she wants to operate at her best , ” she said .   
She stood up straighter , moving the prosthetic tentacles in the weird , stilted way that I ’d seen her walk when I ’d first seen her at the group therapy session .   
She braced herself against the platform , then moved the tentacle down to the catwalk at the searchlight tower ’s edge .   
She grabbed an officer and pulled him along the grating that was the catwalk floor , where the glow from the spotlight illuminated him .   
He was as young as either Tress or I , black , wearing a uniform .   
An earring glinted at his ear .   
“
Can you check his cuffs for me ?
” I did .   
One was loose .   
I tightened it .
“
You ’re unhurt ?
”
I asked the officer .
I could see his nostrils flare , his lips pressed into a line .   
He glared up at me .
“
Situation normal
’s all fucked up .   
We ’re here to help , really .
”
No response .
This was n’t being a hero in a neighborhood , even a hostile neighborhood like Hollow Point or the worst areas of Brockton Bay .   
We were invaders , people who did n’t belong .   
Whether it was guard or prisoner , we had few people we could count as true allies .
I met Tress’ eyes .   
She nodded .
We left the tower , heading in the direction the others had gone .   
Capricorn was leading the way to Ashley ’s cell , the projector compass in hand .
Not that it was necessary .   
I ’d been before .
As I flew closer , I could see the pair of Swansong and Damsel at the balcony .   
both wore the prison - provided coveralls , but Swansong wore a white undershirt or camisole under hers , the front left open .   
Damsel wore only a black sleeveless top , her coveralls tied at the waist .   
Fitting those claws through the sleeves would be very difficult .   
They gripped the railing , metal blades long enough for her to scratch her toes without bending over , a thin , ripped webwork of skin stretched over them .
It was only Swansong who hopped down from the balcony .   
Her blast interrupted her descent , and interrupted many of the shouts and calls from the woman inmates at the other doorways and balconies .
Swansong was as elegant as her raw , crude detonations of darkness and warped space were violent .   
At the same time , I could see the tension in Damsel as she looked down at us , claws gripping metal railing , her eyes wild .   
She looked like she could barely resist jumping down as well .
Capricorn and I were the first at the scene , as Tress dropped down to Rain ’s side , touching one of her new parts .
It was Tristan and Byron , Swansong with Damsel looking down , and then myself .   
Our halves removed by one step , one way or another .
“
Your … sister ?
” Capricorn asked .
“
She ’s stuck where she is , ” Damsel said , referring to herself in the third person .   
She did n’t look like she could sit still , her claws moving , metal scraping metal .
“ I could come .   
We ’re on the same side , ” Damsel made it sound like she was being intentionally insincere .
I met Swansong
’s eyes .
“
She watched the meeting with Goddess , ” Swansong said , as if that summed it up .   
She tilted her head to one side .   
“
Where are Cryptid and Lookout ?
”
“
Lookout is with Goddess , ” I said .
Swansong ’s stare was level .   
Again , that curious stillness .
“ Your little friend is in good hands , ” Damsel commented from above .   
She smiled .
Everything in her micro - expressions was different .   
The degree to which she fractionally widened and narrowed her eyes in the course of a single sentence , the slight movements of her bladed hands , as if to create implications as she said ‘ hands’ , the intonations .   
All of it was keyed in a way that suggested an implicit threat or imminent action , like she was coiled up and ready to … blast with her power or lash out .
This was n’t the Ashley
I ’d come to know .   
This was the Ashley I could imagine working with the Slaughterhouse Nine .
“
Is she safe ?
”
Swansong asked .
“
She’s- ” I started to answer .   
“
She ’s with Goddess .
”
Swansong nodded , “ And Cryptid ?
”
“ Cryptid left .   
On an errand for Goddess with my sister .
”
“
He ’s being more Cryptid - like than usual today , ” Tristan observed .
“
Of course he is , ” Swansong said .   
She glanced at me .   
“
Your sister ?
”
All around us , prisoners were noticing the scene .   
Women ’s voices were raised .   
Pleading to be let out , threatening , commenting .   
Less lewd than the guys’ side had been , but there was still lewdness .
My skin crawled at the thought of Amy .   
My heart raced like I was only a step away from attacking Amy again , yet she was n’t anywhere near here , and I was n’t that angry in the moment .
“
The less said the better , ”
I answered her , as diplomatically as I could .
“
Then I wo n’t say anything .
”
Rain and Tress caught up .
“
Those are my arms , ” Swansong said .
“
What ? ”
Tristan asked .
She pointed at Tress
’s
new addition .   
The black wire mesh connected individual cylinders … pale shells that would have once been parts of Swansong
’s arms .
“
Uh , yeah , ” Rain said .   
“
I wanted to do something more practical when we thought things were getting bad .   
I made a few prototype versions of your arms .   
With levers , switches , and wires inside , like the snapshots Lookout took of the inside of Tress’ suit .
”
“ Sneaky , ” Damsel called out , smiling .
“
There ’s a limit to what I can do with your hands without leaving you worse off , ” Rain sounded apologetic as he explained to Swansong .   
“
And I had a few days where my tinker power was working better .   
Not that that is very tinkered up .   
Half and half .
”
“
It ’s fine , ” Swansong said .   
“ If you ’re going to use anyone
’s arms as a model , you at least used tasteful ones .
”
“
I appreciate the thought , ” Tress said .
“ And
thank you , Swansong , for being okay with the use of your arms .
”
“
Your hands are okay ?
”
he asked Swansong .   
“
They ’re working fine ?
”
“ They ’re sufficient for tonight , thank you .   
Let ’s focus on Lookout and the prison , not me .
”
“ We have one more person to grab , ” Crystalclear said .
Tristan held up the compass .
“
I ’ll get her , ” Crystalclear said .   
“
You catch your teammate up .
”
He wants to tell her that we ’re Goddessed .    
That was fine .
Capricorn clapped his gauntlets together .   
I did n’t miss the flash of dark red across the back of one gauntlet .   
He spoke with authority and confidence , “
Then let ’s talk goals .   
Goddess , Lookout and Natalie are after the assistant Warden and the Wardens Teacher co - opted .   
Lung and Teacher ’s soldiers are at the front and are presumably after Goddess .   
Prisoners are staying put , but we ’re in a weird place right now .
”
“
Weird
how ?
” Rain asked .
“
It ’s about confidence and doubt , ” I said .   
“
Prisoners could riot or test their ankle bombs if they get too agitated or overconfident , and that leads to either casualties or an unsalvageable situation .   
They could betray us if they think this situation does n’t work out for them
, you never know with all the powers we have around us .   
Officers do n’t know who to trust , but they could start shooting people or people with the power could start detonating bombs if they panic .
”
“
That ’s without getting into Teacher and Goddess , ” Capricorn said .
“ Or us , ” Tress said .
“ Or us , ” he conceded .
I looked away , back toward where the fighting was worst .   
The fires extended from the hole Goddess had put in the wall to a nearby administration building .
“ We support Goddess first , ” Swansong said .   
“
Get Lookout , get Natalie , get control of the situation .   
All four of those things are tied into one another .
”
“ I do n’t entirely disagree , ” Capricorn said , “ But Goddess is complicated .   
Do you know what master - stranger protocols are ?
”
“
No , ” Swansong said .
“
It sounds like the kind of thing the annoying Protectorate mooks would use , ” Damsel threw out her remark from a distance , as if it was an extension of Swansong ’s ‘ no’ .
“
It is , ”
I said , my voice firm .   
“
But let ’s settle for saying that the situation is complicated .   
The nicest way I can think of framing it is that if we help her too blatantly , we hurt ourselves in the long run .
”
“ Why do we care ?   
Deal with tomorrow when it comes .   
I know at least two of us are clever enough to come up with something , ” Damsel remarked .
I wondered if we could or should just walk away .   
If we were n’t waiting for Crystalclear to catch up with us again …
“
Maybe we think of it as a question of reputation , ” Swansong said .   
“
If we appear to be too subservient …
”
“ Mm , ” Damsel made a sound .
“
Mm , ” Swansong echoed her .   
She glanced at me and rolled her eyes slightly .
“ I do n’t really care about status , ” Rain said .   
“
I want people to be okay , and … I want us to be okay too .   
I ’m here for a reason , and I do n’t want that to get flipped upside - down or screwed up along the way .   
I know that ’s a crummy thing to prioritize when there are higher priorities , like people ’s safety , Goddess , keeping the peace , and keeping Teacher from becoming the most powerful man on all the earths .
”
“ If he is n’t already , ” Tress ’s expression and tone were dark .
“
It makes sense to go to Goddess , ” Swansong said .
“
It makes sense to split up , ” Crystalclear said , as he rejoined us .   
“
We have other issues .
”
He ’d returned from the apartment with the other undercover member of Foresight .   
The girl was short , her uniform not really fitting her , and she had improvised a mask of several pieces of paper and tape , several sheets forming a cone that encapsulated her face , with holes for the eyes that had pen scribbles surrounding each hole , darkening the perimeters .   
Sheets of paper were connected at one corner each to form ears at the sides of her head .
“ Ratcatcher , meet Breakthrough , ” Crystalclear said .
“ I ’ve theen thome of them around , ” she said .   
“ Thveta and I talked thome before I came .
”
“
Tell them what you told me .
”
“
A little friend of mine thayth that Teacher ith in the tunnelth beneath uth , ” she said .   
She pronounced Teacher like ‘ tee - shirt’ with a silent t at the end , and little like ‘ liddle’ .
“
What ’s in the tunnels ?
”
Rain asked .
“ Networking , ” she said .   
She raised one leg , tapping the bomb .   
“ Control and everything that goeth out of the prithon .
”
“
He ’s turning to his backup plans , ” I said .   
“
We de - fanged the Warden and deputy Warden , the assistant Warden is on our side .   
The person with the control of the portals and the bombs effectively has control of the prisoner population .
”
There was a detonation near the front of the prison .   
I saw the flame leap high .
“
Fuck , ” Crystalclear swore .   
“
That fire is painful to look at with my senses being what they are .
”
“ Yeth .
”
The fire .   
Purple flame .
I could connect the dots , even if it was a little belated .   
Multiple dots , now that I thought about it .   
Multi - layered plans and contingencies .
We were fighting a mastermind after all .
“
He paired Lung and the Pharmacist , ” I voiced my thought aloud .
“
Who and who ?
” Ratcatcher asked .
“ Teacher picked a mercenary tag - team who want to level the prison just as much as Goddess does .   
If we do n’t want people to get hurt , then we ’re going to need to step in .   
Lung is … an old enemy .   
Since half my life ago , about .
”
“
You know him ?
” Crystalclear asked .
“
Yeah .   
More or less .
”
“
You handle that then , if you ’re comfortable .   
I ’ll go with Ratcatcher to the access tunnels .
”
“
We could use a thinker and a level head , ” I said .
“
I ’m kind of under orders to be the level head for Ratcatcher , and I do n’t want to go anywhere near that fire ,
in case I blow a mental fuse .   
I do n’t think this is really negotiable , ” Crystalclear said .
“ Ugh , ” Ratcatcher said .
Ugh is right .   
Crystalclear is just about the only person who is n’t Goddess influenced , who knows what ’s going on .
“ I ca n’t change your mind ?
” I asked .
“
No , ” Crystalclear said .   
“
No , this is the network .   
It ’s important .
”
It ’s important .
I connected to what he was thinking .   
The others , going by their faces , might not have .
The network .   
Possibly with the means of calling for help .
“
Alright , ” I said .
“
You know the way , Rat ?
” Crystalclear asked .
“ I do , ” Ratcatcher said .   
“
We ’ll want more firepower .   
My friendth reported a few powerth .
”
“
Then I ’ll come , ” Tress said .   
“
It’s- it has to be better than talking about master - stranger protocols and doubting myself or my teammates .
”
“
I ’m still not sure I get those protocols , ” Rain said .   
“
But I ’ll do what the team needs .   
Do you need wall - breaking power ?   
Get past any secure doors ?
”
“
No , ” Ratcatcher said .   
“
I can get through motht lockth quick .   
Or my friendth can .
”
As if to punctuate that last statement , a mouse poked its head up from her prison uniform collar , followed by a much larger rat .
“
You talk to rodents ?
”
Rain asked .
“
No .   
Not mush .   
Only crathy people talk to rodenth .   
But rodenth talk to me .   
Very different .
”
“ Handy , ” Rain said .
“
Yes .   
But we do n’t need handy .   
We need firepower , ” Ratcatcher said .
“
Still ?
” Tristan asked .
“ I ’ll come , ” Swansong said .   
“
If the rest of you think you ’ll be okay ?
”
The rest of us .   
Tristan , myself , and Rain .
“ Why go ?
” Tristan asked .
“
Because I trust myself more doing this than I do being near that .
”
“
Can you fight in tunnelth ?
” Ratcatcher asked .
Above , Damsel shook her head , as if it was already known .
“ We ’ll find out , ” Swansong said , contradicting her ‘ sister’ .   
“
But I know
I ’m very good at fighting brutes like Lung .   
Too good .   
I do n’t want to put myself in that situation again , not this soon .
”
“ I … ca n’t argue with that , ” Tress said .
“ Take my phone , ” Capricorn told Crystalclear .   
“
We ’ll stay in touch .
” Crystalclear nodded .
As a quartet , Ratcatcher , Crystalclear , Swansong , and Tress hurried for a spot at the midpoint between three buildings .   
If there was an access hatch , I did n’t see it .   
Women looking down from balconies hurled obscenities , complained about the delays for their dinner , and shouted to each other , asking what was going on with us being down here and the fires at the gate .
It left Capricorn , Rain , and I as the strike squad .   
When we reunited with the others , we would have Goddess and Lookout .   
If there was anyone at the other side of the portal , then we could sure use them too .
But Lung was a problem .
And-
I moved as Tristan took a step forward .   
My hand caught him right in the middle of the chest .   
He stopped here
he was , me in front of him , hand against his chest .
Lung was a problem , but so was Tristan .
My hand moved down to his gauntlet .   
I grabbed it and lifted it .   
Had we been on the other side of the portal , the gauntlet would have been cleaned by the freezing rain .   
It was n’t cleaned .
“ I think we need Byron , ” I said , moving his hand so the light highlighted where the blood was .   
“ We ca n’t have you acting like you did with that guard .
”
“
He had something going on mentally .   
Would n’t stop , ” Tristan said .   
“
It was n’t as uncontrolled as it looked .   
I was just trying to apply enough force to get him to stop .
”
I was n’t sure what to say to that .
“
You told me to rein you in .   
I ’m reining .   
We need Byron .
”
Tristan was still for a long moment .
Too long a moment .   
The fires were growing in the distance , and there was too much going on .
“
No joking here , Tristan .   
Change .
”
“ You had to ask like that .   
Evoking the Tristan - Byron protocol ?
”
“
Yeah ?
”
“ If you ask , I ’m switching , ” he said .   
“
Just-
there ’s no guarantee he ’s on board .
”
“
We ’ll trust him , ” I told Tristan .   
“
He recommended the protocols to me when he was clear and I was n’t .   
I have to believe he ’ll abide by them now .
”
He nodded , and then he passed me the compass .
Dissolving into a blur , he shifted to become Byron .   
Lighter armor , in multiple senses of the word .   
No blood marked his gauntlet .
“
Okay ?
” I asked .   
“
We ’re on the same page ?
”
“ Master - stranger , ” Byron answered .
We cut across the yard , with Rain using his power to slice through the fence .   
It looked like posts were now being abandoned because of the chaos at the front gate .   
Inmates were getting more agitated , and the guards were n’t at nearby towers or posts to tell them to shut it .   
People were heading to where the fires were , to put them out or put the causes of the fire down .
“ Fill us in on Lung , since it looks like he ’s our biggest problem , ” Byron said .
“ Lung is a changer , with powers hooked into the change , ” I said .
“ Like Cryptid ?
”
Rain asked .
“
Different than Cryptid .   
Lung changes to the same thing every time , slow progression , but a steady ramp - up the longer
he ’s in a fight .   
Metal armor , pyrokinesis , enhanced senses , physiology , quickness , added parts .   
He ’s a warlord by temperament , but he was always missing something that let him take his gangs to the next level .
”
“
He has pyrokinesis ?
” Byron asked .
I nodded , content to let the scene that we were approaching serve as the more complete answer to Byron ’s question .   
Fires , purple and otherwise , spread out across ground that should have been exhausted of all fuel sources .   
The heat was being turned up on the admin buildings and the entrance .
Teacher was n’t the type to sic Lung on Goddess and expect a win .   
He was the type to sic the combination of a fireproof monster who manipulated fire and a person who set powers on fire on Goddess and expect a win .
Lung was already partially changed as we sighted him .   
He had enough scales that the officers who shot at him were n’t getting through , and he was big enough that the bullets that did make contact seemed to lack stopping power .   
Each couple of gunshots was answered by Lung throwing out a rolling wave of flames .   
The flames would travel a ways , hit one of the lingering purple flames on the ground , and then explode in size by three times .   
Whole squadrons of officers were sent running .
No Pharmacist to be seen .   
She was nearby , but it seemed to be the peeking - through - a - window nearby , not standing on the battlefield nearby .
No Blindside , no Kingdom Come .
Plenty of armed Teacher thralls .
Lung used his pyrokinesis , and purple flames swelled , billowing in his direction .   
The flames would draw close , then the Pharmacist would extinguish the flames closest to the brute of a man and his underlings .
Interplay .
Byron began drawing out blue motes .   
Rain created his silver scythes .
“
Careful , ” I murmured .
“ Purple fire ignites powers , ” Byron said .   
“ I remember .
”
His water splashed down on one of the worse blazes at the admin building .   
It had been the building where the Warden , his deputy and his assistant had all been set up .
It served to get Lung ’s attention , pulling it away from Goddess and presumably Lookout .
“ Dallon , ” Lung growled the word .   
Still capable of speech .   
“ Pests .   
Too many of you remain .
”
They were hard words to hear put out there so casually .   
Words that made me think of Crystal ’s family , of too many funerals in too short a span of time .
He moved one hand in an almost casual way , and the flames expanded , becoming a slow - motion , rolling detonation , with a sound like the thunder of a dozen lightning strikes .   
A lick of purple flame caught it and ignited the pyrokinesis itself , the purple disappearing in the rolls of blinding oranges and reds .   
Lung ’s
regular pyrokinesis manipulated those flames , in turn , expanding them .
No games , nothing held back .   
Only a wall of flame that could have swamped many houses and conventional buildings , produced in mere seconds .   
A ball passed between two people , growing with each toss , with us in the line of fire .
I saw it coming , braced myself , and activated the Wretch , positioning myself between the wall and my teammates .
For a moment , an eye - blink , I saw the Wretch outlined .
Byron had bent his head down , armored arm shielding his eyes .   
Rain was the one who seemed to suffer the most from the ambient heat , with no shield or barrier to protect him .
“
Go , ”
I told him , indicating .
He bolted for the building .   
I saw Lung move , drawing a hand back with flame appearing in the palm .   
I pushed out with my aura , taking flight , with every intent of interrupting his throw .
A fast - moving spark struck the Wretch , leaving me without my defenses .   
Another hit me dead center in the breastplate , making me sag in the air as my body was momentarily paralyzed , my heart skipping a beat with the intensity of the shock .
Other shots were aimed at Byron , who seemed to endure , and at Rain , who did n’t .   
I saw Rain fall where Byron and I had withstood the hits , not making it to the door into the admin building before the momentary paralysis gripped him .
“
Go , ” Byron said .
I flew in Rain ’s direction , while Byron stopped using his water to put out fires and started using it to get at Lung from oblique angles .   
Here and there , the water caught purple flames , and became gouts of the stuff .   
Wherever she was , the fires extinguished before they reached Lung .
If he was immune to it , there was no reason to continually extinguish it .   
It was very possible that the Pharmacist ’s fire could ignite Lung ’s fire immunity .   
But she had eyes on the situation , and she was keeping him safe from her power , while he thrived in an environment where fire and heat were so ready at hand .
Lung ignored Byron ’s water , ignited or no , and threw out flame , walling off my access to Rain .
In the midst of it , I saw Rain using one of his lesser - used powers .   
I could see it only because I saw the purple sparks and the lesser purple flames in the grass swell .
Reinforcements had to be on the way .   
Crystalclear was working on it in the access tunnels .   
We had Cryptid on the far side .   
We had- fuck me , we had my sister , of all people .   
The people we ’d lined up on the far side to delay Teacher were no doubt regrouping .
We had to survive long enough for help to come , while keeping the monsters like Lung from doing any real , lasting damage .   
If we could do that , then our lesser sins might be forgiven or looked past .   
The harm of guards , our means of gathering information .   
The false pretenses by which we ’d arranged our visits , when we had a real stake in things .
We had to endure .   
We had to endure against a man - turned - dragon who would burn any normal individual to a crisp , and a hidden woman who would expertly burn the abnormal out of anyone else .   
Until reinforcements .
They were showing up now .   
Help .   
Assistance .
The first of them , unfortunately , were
Lung ’s reinforcements , not ours .   
A blood - spattered Warden and Deputy Warden .
Our reinforcements were worrisome in a completely different way .   
When Goddess lowered herself from the top of the building to the ground , voices went quiet in nearby buildings .   
She was essentially alone .   
Natalie and Kenzie were close enough to see , but they were apart from Goddess .   
They had the assistant warden with them .   
Our guy , who theoretically was able to detonate the bombs that were strapped to most prisoner ’s ankles , or to leave them be .
It looked like he was closer to panic than not , for what little it mattered .   
He , Lookout , and Natalie were in the company of a woman who stood behind Lookout , hands on our teammate ’s shoulders .   
Monokeros .   
The child - killing Unicorn IV .
And I could n’t even afford to do anything about it .
Lung roared , as only a person with an enhanced physique could , and then he leaped forward .
Goddess matched him , lifting herself up , the purple fire catching and then tracing the invisible diagrams and forces that buoyed her , only a few feet behind her because she moved fast enough to outrun its pace .   
More fire traced other powers she was using , blinding her and burning away the invisible , abstract forces that reached out from her and toward Lung ’s brain .
It did n’t seem to give her pause .   
She flew forward , no doubt straight into the convoluted trap that Teacher would have planned out weeks before .








I ’d fought Lung before .   
He was the very first bullet point in a handful , when it came to the fact that some people really hated emotion powers .   
Which was fair-
I still felt something small twist up inside me when I even thought about Snag ’s feeling - of - loss attacks .   
But Lung was part of the handful I ’d fought where I could input fear and get anger .   
Dean had run into the same thing , with emotions other than fear returning the same output .
Some people , especially those of a more feral stripe , just processed things in a different way .   
The upside was the tactical advantage in it , if I could adjust my expectations fast enough .
The downside was that I had to make that adjustment .   
Most of my costumed fighting experience was that my enemies would hesitate , get sloppy , or back off , but Lung , like Bitch , like the cooler but still
dangerous Krieg or the seemingly unflappable Victor who would still act differently when under the influence of my power , attacking faster and more recklessly .   
They were the people who were angry at the world , or those with the natural predisposition to fight rather than fly .
It meant I had his attention .   
Even before I activated my aura , it still meant he was keeping an eye on me , because he had experienced it before .   
Actually using my aura helped , provoking him on an emotional level .
With just a little more provocation coming from the hot purple apocalypse my aura was spreading across our shared battlefield .
I flew hard , chased by a stuttering spear of purple flame and a staccato , rolling explosion of fire where my emotion aura pulsed out and caught fire .   
The aura pushed out , and the fires that caught traced in that direction , before flowing back in and toward me , stopping when the pulse ended .   
That was what I assumed was responsible for the rolling part of the wall of explosions .
There was a crashing sound .   
Goddess was dealing with the mooks , breaking the earth and then hurling that broken ground at them from one direction , while throwing other debris at them from another .   
They were forced to run for cover .   
Into the same building as Monokeros and Lookout .
I started to fly to pursue .
“
No ! ”
Byron shouted , barely audible given the distance and the hellscape of flame below .   
“
Only … deal with Lung !   
You !   
I ca n’t !
”
I wanted to argue .   
Lung was n’t dealt with .   
Not by someone like me .   
Byron and Tristan were a better answer than a brute like me .
I stopped myself .   
Byron was already making his way inside .
I at least knew Lung .
There was a strategy in what I ’d been doing , in using my aura .   
There were many strategies in this .   
Lung was n’t used to being on the defensive , and he had to limit what he did , even stepping to one side as the purple fire swelled and the pharmacist was slow to recognize and react to the problem .   
Goddess hurled a metal beam at him , and he leaped to the side , where he was struck by a volley of something else .   
Slivers or spikes .   
Some impaled him , but they did n’t slow him down .
My eyes were open , and in the relatively dark area , Lung was bright and easy to see .   
Where he was covered in metal scales , the metal reflected the flames .   
The rest of him was more of a silhouette against the bright flames .   
I could see the dragon mask , different from the one he had once had , with chains cutting through short black hair , tying the mask to his head .
I ’d hoped for a tell , that the easily provoked Lung would turn his head around and shout at the Pharmacist for her failure to be careful .   
That he ’d look to a nearby window to make sure she was still alive , and that he did n’t have to worry about burning to death for-
I had no idea
how old he was , I realized .   
No idea how long it had been since he ’d had to worry about burning to death .
No idea , and no indication that he was looking to any specific location for the Pharmacist .
The other tell that I was looking for was in the movement of purple flame-
it was why I was paying attention to the flame that nipped at my toes as it burned at the motive forces of my flight , and to the purple explosions that flared up each time I pulsed out with my aura .   
It was the approach I ’d used when dealing with Mama Mathers .   
Cape out of sight ?   
Watch their power instead .
With each pulse of my aura , the flames grew , and the Pharmacist dashed the flames , extinguishing a swathe of the fire around Lung as if throwing invisible water on the area .   
I could pulse it , see the response time , repeat , see if it changed .   
I could establish a rhythm , then fake them out .   
How fast did they respond then ?
Lung started hurling streams of fire into the sky .   
Easy enough to dodge .
Still pushing with my flight to keep ahead of the trail , tracing a wide circle around the area , I pulsed my aura again .   
Was there a shape to the extinguished area ?   
It was n’t circular or neat .   
Did it vary ?   
Why ?
I was heading for a gap between two streams of fire when they ignited with the purple flame .   
It was as though the streams of fire were gas , and the gas had been ignited .   
With momentum already in play , I could only drop my forcefield , stop flying , stop using my aura , and let myself sail through the area .
Knees tucked to my breastplate , hands inside my hood , at the back of my head , elbows shielding my face , my hood pulled down , I hurtled through the purple fire .   
I was in a cannonball tumble , and felt the wash of heat around me .   
It was blinding in its brightness , so close to me , and the rest of the world was pitch darkness .
Setting fire on fire . 
 
I opened my eyes , and the world was spinning around me as I tumbled head over heels through the darkness , still in the cannonball pose , still with none of my powers active .   
With the surroundings being as dark as they were , I had only glimpses of the world , of the swathe of orange - yellow and purple - red fire , of stark spotlights , of the lights inside apartments and windows .
I used the sea of purple fire to orient myself , the dots and slices of yellow and orange serving as my position - reference for where the apartments and staff buildings were , and put everything into that perspective frame .
I lurched to the side as if by some telekinetic force , found nothing recognizable , and glimpsed another sea of fire , of red and orange .   
Fear stabbed me in the chest as I tumbled through a world that made no sense .   
The sea of purple I ’d seen before was dissipating , breaking up , and a wall of fire loomed before me , pulling me toward it with an insane , inviolable force .
I forced my frame of reference to shift again .   
I ’d had everything the wrong way around .   
The sea of purple fire had been the residual fire from Lung ’s attack , the dots of yellow and orange just sparks in the air , not the faces of buildings .   
A moment of dizziness , of disorientation and limited lighting .
In the moment that I made sense of the world again , I could confirm to myself that there was no purple fire near me .   
I used my flight to stop falling , and flipped myself around to the right orientation .   
My heart pounded .   
I was in a place where the air was cold .
I could smell burned fabric , but I was n’t on fire .   
I had to check myself twice before settling on the conclusion that I was alright .
Lung ’s focus was consumed with Goddess , now .   
She was dismantling the entrance building of the prison , using the components to mount her attack .   
Beams , chunks of rubble , volleys of-
the slivers or spikes from before .   
They were pulled from concrete .   
Rebar .
I saw Lung fire out the long gouts of flame that pierced through the sky , illuminating the scant clouds above and turning them orange .   
He placed them all in Goddess’ vicinity , and she used her telekinesis to scatter the flame .   
The fires did n’t go out , instead licking through the heavy smoke in the air like slow motion explosions .
Lung was keeping the air aflame using his pyrokinesis .
In the moment that she turned to the nearby building , her focus was n’t on Lung .   
He was still in action , leaping to a steel beam that had pierced the ground , his weight making it sink until it came to rest against a nearby fence .   
The burning smoke above swelled , the beams connecting again .
“ Goddess !
” I shouted .   
“ Get away !
”
Too far away to be heard .   
Rain hurled a scythe , and it sliced through the beam , tracing a silver line .   
Lung sprung from the beam , and the force of the movement made it sever .
While airborne , he slashed with one hand , flames at his fingertips , and fire moved in a similar pattern a dozen feet below and behind him .   
The movement of the fire connected one of the columns of fire he ’d made near Goddess to a nearby patch of purple flame .   
It ignited , and Lung leaped back as the purple swept up the columns of fire , toward Goddess .   
She did n’t react in time , and the three expanding columns of fire grew to the point
there was no space between them .
Lung ’s landing in a spot of clearing was a heavy one .   
With the landing , the forces that were gathering the fire of the columns together began to dissipate .   
The purple fire had nothing to burn , so it went out too .   
I saw Goddess flying away from the point the growing columns had converged , on fire and not moving in straight lines .
My first impulse was that I had to help her .   
I thought of master - stranger protocols , but the only thing to cross my mind was that I still needed to stop Lung .
Lung marched through knee - high fire , grabbing one of his wrists , hauling on it .   
His shoulder came apart almost as if he ’d torn it partially off , a gap visible in the flesh over where ball met socket .   
Spikes and scales spilled out , stabbing through flesh and filling the gap , layering the surrounding area .   
Rain ’s silver blades curved through the air before hitting rubble , beams , and ground- by my vantage point , I could see that he was firing blind .   
One came within ten feet of Lung , and I saw Lung change course , striding into flames taller than he was .   
Disappearing into the fire , where he had cover .
There was something colder in him than I ’d seen in any of our past encounters .   
The feral edge was still there , but the Lung I ’d known would n’t have ducked into the flame to-
A column of flame stabbed skyward like an giant ’s spear , forged of explosions .   
I flew out of the way , and the spear curved , following me .   
I tried to fly    back toward the base of the column so that the ‘ head’ with the momentum behind it would have a harder time chasing me , saw a light pulse within it , and I put some distance between myself and the column .   
The column expanded- regular orange fire , and not purple .   
He was holding back on the purple .
If he did n’t want it , then I would provide it .
I used my aura , with an eye on where the purple flames were still burning below .   
The purple fire on the ground expanded , touched other flames and spread through them .   
It was a domino effect , and one that Lung seemed aware of .   
He used his power to extinguish fires around him , a sharp intake of breath ’s span before the purple fire spread to that area .   
From her vantage point , the Pharmacist did much the same , extinguishing more of the purple fire .
But the purple fire traced its way up the column that I was still getting away from .   
It put it out of Lung
’s reach , because his power did n’t work on purple fire so much as it just fed a given area with more fire .   
The Pharmacist had the ability to manipulate the purple flame , but she did n’t have the versatility or strength to go with it that a leveled - up Lung did .
I ’d knocked down the column , even spooked him .   
My use of my aura was a slap in his face .
He was colder than he ’d once been , but he still got mad .   
I had his attention again .
Columns and tapered spikes of fire speared up without much warning or reasoning as to where they came from .   
Lung was n’t near all or even most of them , but he fired , and the orange light illuminated me .   
As Teacher ’s thralls had done with their anti - air guns , Lung was trying to box me in , caging me .   
Five spikes in a couple of seconds , all curving in the air as I changed my direction .   
One ignited , turning purple , and the ignition caught on my flight trail .
If I slowed enough to fly around instead of forward , that flame would catch me .
I flew forward , instead , full speed , with a column looming in my way .   
Nearer to the ground , I saw Lung connect it to purple fire , and that augmented flame climbed faster than I could fly forward .   
It would balloon in size before I got past it , and each pulse of my aura made those flames lunge higher .
I kept using my aura , all the same .
At the last moment , a change of direction , then nothing at all .
As before , I tumbled through darkness .   
No forcefield , no flight .   
Only a general arc of travel with me as a dark shape against a night sky .   
Sweat drenched me just from the ambient heat , and that sweat stung my eyes as my head rotated and the droplets traveled across my face .
I let myself fall , powers dark , the wind alternately freezing and skin - searingly hot as it whipped at my face , at my costume and my hair .
As I fell down , fire spiked up , aimed right for me .   
I flew , and purple flame below me and around me billowed out , swelled , and lanced toward me , depending on its shape , chasing that flight .
As I made my aerial maneuvers around flares that worked like explosions constrained within invisible cylinders , the heat in the air sucked all moisture from my mouth and eyes .   
Had I been running , the heat would have knocked the wind out of me , saw me crumpling to my knees .
My flight did n’t draw on any well of physical capacity like that .   
Where anyone else might have been drained , I was …
I was drained of something closer to my humanity .   
I was my power in action ,
my focus , my battle - sense .
I was more a Glory Girl than the Warrior Monk right now , and that was okay .   
If the focus of a dangerous , barbaric teenage me was going to keep me in the game in a moment like this , I would tap that focus with no regrets .
Maybe wrong to think that within a few seconds of recognizing how I was letting more human , fair parts of me fall away .
His senses were improving , going by his ability to track me in the gloom .   
More eruptions were coming .
Frustration welled in my chest .   
I was fighting like Glory Girl and that kept me fighting , but she was someone who charged in , and that was n’t a possibility in the now .   
The purple fire burned away powers , and Lung ’s heat burned away … my reserves .   
I could n’t fight in a battlefield this hot for that long , and the others did n’t seem to have many more opportunities , either .
When I ’d played basketball , ‘ giving 110%’ was the refrain , over and over again .   
With my mom , it had been to ‘ give my all’ .   
Even Amy-
Fuck .   
With the name , there were a hundred mental pictures , a hundred scenes and feelings , crashing in .   
Focus gone , the image in my mind ’s eye so intense that my efforts to push it away only dragged it in closer .
Double fuck , I thought , as fire came down from above , far too close to me .   
He ’d manipulated the fire of a spear of flame that extended high above me .   
The prickle of heat and the wave of it that seemed to soak into my core and take the breath from my lungs and the oxygen from my blood hit me harder than the last time .   
It was that staggering , fall - to - my - knees kind of heat , and it had n’t been a direct hit .   
This time , even though there was n’t a physical component to it , my flight wavered , my speed suffered .
All at a time it counted most .
Fuck , I thought , and it was n’t an angry , forceful , empowered fuck , in defiance of the world .   
The fuck that I could n’t even voice was the kind of sound that came out with a whimper , that made someone sound half their age , uttered just before they broke down into tears , slumped against a wall .
And even that image evoked half - formed images of my sister , hollowed out , harrowed , her hair greasy because she ’d spent the last few days working on me .   
Her arms and her old costume had been crusted with bodily fluids , my bodily fluids .   
With dogs and cats , insects , and rats , probably , pulled apart into their constituent parts and used to build me .
To have it driven home that my weak point was this weak , this capable of breaking my focus .   
There were moments my emotions choked me up , gripped my throat , tied my stomach into knots , paralyzed me or made me agitated .
But to act as Glory Girl , to have Amy so easily take that away , all over again ?   
It made me feel like my essential being , my heart , was n’t even there anymore .   
That heartless emptiness inside me was n’t anything new .   
But it had never hit me to this degree at a moment that I felt like I was functioning .
It was n’t me that I heard or imagined with that small , nothing - left fuck , but her on the other side of a room , as someone banged on a door .   
A scene framed not by wood , but by a length of my body , by hands that reached up , groping at the air , toward her .
The moment after she ’d let me start registering memories again .
I landed , and my legs buckled beneath me .   
I dropped to my knees , fires burning high just twenty feet away .   
A steel beam gave me a modicum of cover , but it had been lying in the blaze long enough that I could feel the heat radiating off the metal , which did n’t help manners .
One hundred and ten percent .   
Give it your all .   
Do your best , Victoria .   
An endless refrain I ’d heard for far too long .   
From my mom , from my dad , from my teachers , from my teams .
I could n’t figure out what mode to shift to , where I had that one hundred and ten percent to give .   
I could n’t reach for the Scholar or the Warrior Monk in this moment and have it fail me .   
I needed something else .   
Something more raw .
Wretch , I thought .   
Forcefield up , I reached for the beam .   
My hands fell short , but the Wretch did n’t .
Glory Girl ca n’t win this .
So what does a one - hundred and ten percent Wretch look like , then ?
I lifted up the steel beam ,   
The Wretch dug fingers in with enough force to leave indents in the warm metal ’s surface .
I took off .   
Lung was preoccupied , sending flame in the opposite direction from me .   
I had a moment , so I looked up , flying higher to where the air was cooler .   
A twenty - foot steel beam dangled from the Wretch ’s hands , one end held firm enough that metal distorted in multiple places , the other end swinging below us .
In the cool air , looking up and trying to find my center , trying to tell myself I was n’t making a mistake by bringing the Wretch into this , I could see the blue circles and lines .
A constellation drawn against the night ’s sky , directly above Lung and the scene .   
The motes were n’t moving , though .   
It was being drawn .
I exhaled slowly , and my breath shook slightly in the process .   
A tension I had n’t realized I ’d had was released .   
If Byron was capable of doing this , then he ’d confirmed Kenzie was okay .   
That situation was dealt with .
In the weirdest , most twisted way , it was n’t even a good ‘ dealt with’ .   
That tension had helped in its way , holding me together .   
Now I had to deal with me .
So stupid , that a mere thought could take me out of the zone and lead to a critical mistake .   
That gout of flame that could have hit me , if I ’d been a half - second slower .
Even when Glory Girl was at her peak , working with reactions primed and giving her supposed one - hundred - and - ten - percent , she had-
I had been splashed with acid and enzymes , dissolved alive .
One hundred and ten percent Wretch .   
But I ’d pause first before going there .   
A nod to the Warrior Monk , who was so tired , so beleaguered , her efforts frustrated .   
I pulsed with my aura , and I watched the aftermath , Lung ’s slight head turn , the extinguishing and the shape of the extinguishing .
Goddess was back , and she had friends .   
People from nearby apartments .   
Goddess was shielding them as they got into position .
Are we there already ?   
She ’s just taking the people she wants , and the people with the ability to detonate the ankle bombs are … secured ?   
Did she and Lookout get them all ?
The Warrior Monk recoiled at the idea , recognized it as a cause for alarm , printed in black ink on white paper , all caps , underlined .
If she ’d gone that far , if we were already there , it was possible there was no coming back from this .   
There was no getting through this night in such a way that things returned to square one .
That idea shook me .   
The Warrior Monk faltered .   
From sixty percent to fifty percent .   
‘
110%’ so far away it was n’t worth reaching for .
Behind Lung and behind me , the building began coming apart again .   
Each chunk that flew away from the building flew toward Lung .   
Rain hurled his silver blades , but Lung was keeping an eye out for them .
He was big now , but he was nimble .   
A corner of the building hit the ground and rolled through the fires without breaking up .   
Lung leaped on top of it , then leaped to another point , the beam that Rain had sliced .   
It was just the tip , cut at a diagonal , and left leaning against the fence .   
Lung had one foot on the tip , another on the top of the chickenwire fence , barbed wire crumpled underfoot .   
No skin showed , his arms , legs , spine and neck were all extended now , and the mass along the length of his body was swelling steadily .   
He reached up with claws of steel , seized his mask , and tore it free , casting it off .
The face beneath was even less human .
Lung lifted one claw , moving it through the air .   
Fire swelled dramatically .   
I could see that the point where he did n’t even need the purple fire anymore was n’t that far away .
And then what ?   
Were we supposed to abandon the prison ?   
Leave it for Teacher ?   
He would find a way to seal the door , the prisoners would be trapped inside , and he would claim them , one by one .
No , I thought .   
With the Wretch out , the memory of the hospital was all around me .   
The helplessness , the lack of hope , the altered mental state .   
That was what Teacher wanted .
Goddess
wanted-
I closed my eyes ..
She was scarily close to what I wanted , and I was n’t sure how much of that was the master - stranger effect that was supposedly in place .   
One hundred and ten percent .   
The study of powers .   
The authority , people organized and listening to her .   
Even now , she was sorting out the people she ’d brought from the apartments .
Lung was leaving the area , moving toward Goddess .   
He would leave the area beneath Byron ’s sword of Damocles , beneath the constellation of stars and the lines that wove them together .
Because it was n’t enough ?
I dove for Lung , the Wretch gripping the beam in a way that was not at all drawing it back for a big swing .   
I ’d deal .
Twenty feet long , give or take , a foot and a half tall .   
I ’d picked up cars before , always an awkward affair , and even this impressive chunk of metal was only a third or quarter the weight of those vehicles .
“
Hit him , ”
I whispered the words .   
“ Swing this at him .   
Come on !
”
Lung was drawing out fire , sending it toward Goddess’ crowd .   
She was atop one of the damaged apartments now , her people organizing into battle lines .   
A forcefield went up , as did something that looked more like an energy gate or portal than a forcefield or wall .   
Off to the side , a lopsided , top - heavy minion made of slime or mud drawing itself out of the ground .
Goddess interrupted the first wave of flame .   
The second , laced with purple fire , spilled over .   
The fire ignited the forcefield , the minion , and the gate .   
The gate fluctuated , drawing the fire toward its center , condensing it into a brilliant point , with the edges vibrating more intensely with every second .
The gate crumbled .   
Free energy lashed out , and two people died .   
the forcefield went out , and people were forced into a retreat .
I reached past the Wretch ’s hands to touch the metal , gripping the lip of the beam in my burned hand .   
I pulled , straining to draw it back .   
The Wretch did n’t obey .
A moment later , I was flying into flames , so bright and chaotic after the darkness above that I could n’t breathe or tell purple from orange .   
It was almost like slow motion , seeing Lung start to turn his snake - like neck around to look at me with one eye that glowed like a drop of molten metal .   
A distended face broken up into five sub - sections contracted together in an alien grimace .
The beam would n’t hit .   
I canceled the Wretch , and let it hit the ground a few feet from Lung .
I hit the beam , rather than Lung .   
One end remained mostly in place , the other coming around to strike Lung .   
The effect was nowhere near what I would have achieved had I been able to swing the beam like a bat .   
As it was , it knocked him back toward the area that burned .   
Purple flames were extinguished in the moment before Lung could roll through them , and he sprung to his feet .   
Before I ’d recovered from the act of striking out , he was on his feet , hands moving , and the flames around me swelled .
Rain was still throwing out his crescents .   
Many were being intercepted by swells of purple fire .   
It likely did n’t help that I was close .
I flew to the beam , grabbing it and trusting the Wretch to grab it on pure reflex .   
It was a narrow shield and a deflection that kept the worst of the flames from knocking the Wretch back out of existence .   
It was my weapon , to keep Lung at bay , to try and knock him down .   
This time we swung .
He caught the beam with both arms , feet skidding in dirt .
Then it was only one foot in dirt .   
The other came up , forward , and stomped down on the length of metal .     
The Wretch broke , and the end of the metal beam struck the earth with enough force to send dirt pluming over my head , above me and behind me .
His weapon now .   
He drew it back , adjusting his grip as he did to account for the lack of traction , ready to swing .
He was still adjusting when Goddess used her telekinesis on the beam .   
He was sent skidding back , tumbling into fire and the piles of wreckage that had been telekinetically hurled at him while he ’d cultivated the fires around him and worked himself up .
“
Capricorn , ” Goddess said .   
Her voice was n’t pitched at a level that would be heard with the distance between herself and him .
The water came down all the same .   
To say the water fell would have been wrong .   
It was directed down .   
Faster than falling water .   
It was sent down like it was shot from a gun .
Where the water hit earth , it became a geyser of mud , and if Lung had n’t slipped away at the last moment , then he was being driven down as mud was sent flying up to heights taller than some of the staff buildings nearby .   
The purple fire caught the water and ran through it , more intense , not less intense , for the water .
It was loud , and then it was silent , the contrast so stark that it left my ears screaming .
Where there had been water , there was now a small mountain of stone , all spikes radiating up and out from the epicenter .   
The licks of purple flame were going out .
Look , I told myself .   
Put the desperate struggle aside for a second , focus on the objective .   
I ’m proud of Victoria the scholar , the person who studies powers and keeps an eye out for the solutions .
Some purple fires lingered .   
Some faded .   
If I imagined that the spike of stone blocked the Pharmacist ’s view , I could eliminate some positions .
“
That was good , ”
I heard Goddess behind me .
“
Was ?
”   
I asked .   
I shook my head .
“ Is ?
”
She had her good points .   
She had her great points .   
She had her amazing points , even .   
This was n’t one of them .   
I paused for a second , then decided it was endearing .   
Then things were good .
“
I would n’t say for sure that it ’s over , ” I said .   
“
And if it is n’t over , we wo n’t have much of an opportunity .
”
“ I ’d use my danger sense , but the fires blind me , ” she remarked .
“ Understandable .
”
“ Teacher ’s lessers went into the building .   
The tinkers , the thinkers .
”
“
Capricorn got them , I think .
”
“
Good .   
Then-
”
She stopped speaking    as something glowed deep within the stone .
“
That ’s Lung for you , ” I said .   
I sounded calmer than I felt .   
I realized I still had the Wretch active .   
I had n’t let it go .   
A good thing that Goddess had n’t approached me .   
“
He gets stronger over time .   
If we have n’t beat him yet , we might not be able to .
”
“ I do n’t fucking lose or draw , ” Goddess said .
The use of her telekinesis was wilder , now .   
It was hasty , geometric shapes cutting through mud and dirt , carving lines into the beams and wood that she lifted into the air .   
Like lines in something tightly coiled that had come free , the telekinesis struck out at random around the things she was lifting .   
Mud splashed and rubble was demolished .
One by one , she sent spikes of wood flying .   
She sent beams , sheet metal and corrugated steel crushed into lances and spears .   
They plunged through the stone , into the glowing heart .   
Each impact was an ear - splitting screech of metal on stone , of stone breaking , nails on a chalkboard with the volume turned up to twenty out of ten .
The volley was still going when stone cracked at the very edge of Capricorn ’s stone fixture .   
Compared to the noise of the ongoing assault against the glowing center , Lung rising from the mud and cracked stone was almost quiet .   
The glow had been a decoy .
The fires around us had been mostly quenched by the cascade of water , but his scales were shiny .   
Black mud settled into cracks while the scales caught the orange light .   
His eyes seemed brightest of all , and they narrowed in pain as purple fire crept along his arm and shoulder .
The Pharmacist extinguished fire , but it seemed she was limited to extinguishing what she could see .   
Fire burned in crevices , crept out further with more and more speed .   
It hurt him , and where it hurt him , he healed , and the healing made it burn hotter .   
With the way it crept along the exterior of his body , she would n’t have been able to see all of the flame without being here .
Even with that , he did n’t go running to her .   
He turned toward us and he growled .   
The face with the multiple sections that could pull away or draw in had expanded , and the growth included his neck now , with sections that could pull back , revealing teeth within .   
There were spots that looked like they were scales that caught the light really well , but I was suspicious that they were eyes glowing molten .
Goddess sent the remainder of the volley at him .   
When he moved , it was n’t as fast as before .
“
Careful !
”
I voiced my alarm , even before I could articulate what I meant .
He was slow , but it was an intentional slow .   
As a steel beam slammed into his arm , crushing part of it , driving through flesh and scale , he did n’t look surprised or bothered .    
He lunged out of the way of the remainder of the volley , and then he seized his damaged flesh .
Where scales had been parted , he dug in claws , and he tore away the flesh that burned .   
Damage that would have killed another man served for Lung to have a handhold in his own altered flesh .   
He tore into chest and arm , the chunks burning like crimson rags soaked in gasoline .
I took flight before he could finish .   
I saw him tear away fifteen pounds of mass with blade - like scales embedded in skin , in muscle , and in one fragment of bone .   
I saw the blood spill to the ground by modest buckets worth , and he barely seemed to care .   
His focus was on the hand that he ’d used to tear , that now burned .
Goddess was using the weapons she ’d already used for her earlier volley .   
They were pulled free all as one , then sent out in another volley .   
As Lung brought his wrist to his mouth , the volley struck home .   
Spikes that were ten feet long impaled his legs and fixed them to the ground .   
Others caught him in the chest .   
One struck his face and knocked a mouth - part free , and sent the burning hand flying .
At his back , wings unfolded .   
He opened the various mouth parts to drool out the last chunks of his hand .
Wretch , one hundred and ten percent .   
I flew at him .
Fires swelled around him , faster and larger than before , and where purple flames still burned , they caught the fires and made them swell .
While Lung was missing half of his right arm , shoulder to wrist , a pectoral and his left claw , I had slim opportunity .
The Wretch seized one spike as we passed it .   
My first stab was uneven , mis - aimed because the Wretch did n’t coordinate .   
Lung swatted the point aside with a stump of a wrist at the end of a long limb .   
He exhaled , and breathed a plume of fire my way .
It swept over the Wretch , but it did n’t ignite her .   
As I passed over him , his snake - like neck let his head rise , point straight up , then point back , with no difficulty .
I landed at a point beyond him , boots skidding in mud .
The Wretch started with a shape like me , and it expanded to a different shape .   
I gripped a spear that had deflected off of scale , aware that fires around me were growing larger .
I turned the Wretch on , then off , on , off .   
It was an inconsistent , lurching strength , one where I was handling a metal lance that had to weigh more than I did
and I was handling it with ordinary human strength , then a moment later hands that were n’t mine gripped it , and it might as well have been weightless .
I found the orientation I wanted , as Lung brought his injured arm down and made every square foot of space around us burn .
I flew through the hellscape of flame and smoke , where Lung was only a dim silhouette and a position I remembered .   
My grip on my weapon was a shaky one , one that alternated between me having the strength to hold the weapon and the ability to direct my posture while holding it .
Two seconds of flying forward , trying to keep the weapon on target .
A moment , caught between heartbeats , where Lung was suddenly visible , looming in my view .
And then another moment , as my racing heart contracted , where he gripped my weapon , catching it in one hand .   
Even with half of his arm missing , he managed to fight the Wretch ’s strength .
He jerked the weapon to one side , his strength matching the Wretch or catching it off guard .   
The handle of the weapon tore through my forcefield .
There was no fire immediately around us now , but that was because Lung and the Pharmacist both wanted to keep Lung away from the purple fire .   
Both used their ability to extinguish flame to maintain a clearing .
Which did n’t mean it was n’t roasting here .   
Sweat ran down my face in streams .   
My hair was wet against the back of my neck , and my body was drenched in it , armpit to ankle .
My body .
I have eight hands that are n’t Victoria Dallon
’s .
I caught another fallen weapon , trusted the Wretch to catch yet another .   
While Lung ’s hand was occupied with the lance I ’d used , I attacked him with two more weapons , aiming to impale him .
His wings flapped , and he was working on freeing himself from the spikes that nailed him to the ground .   
The Wretch drove him back down , bringing two more points down to his position .
He reached out , breaking one- manipulating flame with the other , to drive me closer to him .   
I went up , back , and down to the ground again , feet sticking into sucking mud .
Tristan ’s mass of spikes was an arsenal .   
The Wretch ’s invisible hands gripped stone , gripped the spikes that Goddess had driven into the heart of this structure .
Fire washed over the Wretch .   
If it broke , I would burn or I would choke in the heavy smoke , but it was stronger against sustained onslaughts .
He pulled free of the spikes that impaled him to the ground .   
A tide of dirt caught him .   
Powers lashed out , from Goddess’ new retinue , and I could only see a flash of green through a haze of smoke , hear a crack , see the shadow of the top - heavy slime minion .
Work with me .   
Fight him .   
This is what we both want .
I moved my arm , flinging it forward , bidding the Wretch to do the same .   
It threw three .   
Two were thrown in a way that would have hurt him if they hit points forward , and one was on course to hit Lung .
He was occupied with Goddess , but he still had the ability to strike it aside .
I still held more .   
I closed the distance , spearing toward him with multiple points .   
These too he fended off , with enough force that the Wretch was broken .
To get away from any fire and away from the heat , I had to fly up and away , into choking smoke that demanded I hold my breath .   
My eyes watered .
Below me , a silver scythe - blade cut through the smoke .   
I saw it hit Lung .
“ Hit him !
”
I had the Wretch surrounding me again , and then was back in the fray .   
More weapons scooped up , my throws timed for when I thought I could land a blow .   
I could see the line of silver across Lung ’s chest .
He ducked the volley .   
Claws dug for dirt in purchase , his wings thrusting him forward .   
Powerful , but not powerful enough to disturb that silver line .
My eye was on the line , and I knew I could well be killing a man if I connected a blow .
I still grabbed the shattered trunk of a tree that had been thrown at an earlier part of the fight , and swung it at him , aiming for an undodgeable wallop more than a decisive blow .   
I hoped it would connect and split him .
Goddess needed it to .   
We needed it to .   
If we could n’t , Lung would kill us all .
The hit connected , and I saw the spray of blood as one side of his chest cavity opened .   
Sternum to lower rib .   
Sliced through the lung .
There was no humor in the irony , only a chill , as I saw blood fountain out .
In the midst of smoke , I saw him stagger .   
I saw him draw in a deep breath , his chest coming apart in sections , like twenty fragments breaking apart , then coming back together in another configuration .   
His back popped , scale scraping against scale as it extended .
Then the wind turned , and the smoke was heavier .   
It was pitch black out and the smoke made it even harder for the light we had to illuminate the scene .   
People on the periphery were unable to do much .
It had n’t even slowed him down .
“ Goddess !
” I shouted .   
We needed to coordinate on this .
“
She ’s gone .   
Getting more help , ” a woman ’s voice cut through the smoke .
Too little , too late .
The Wretch was n’t enough .
Even if I ’d been one hundred percent coordinated , it would n’t have been enough .
The purple flames surged , diffuse in the gray - black haze of smoke .   
Lung ’s eyes were molten white , larger than before .
I heard him chuckle .   
He knew .   
That we were past the point where we could do it .
Hollow words , to give my ‘ all’ .   
Hopeless words .
I ’d needed this .   
I ’d needed to be able to do this on some level .   
And I had n’t been able to .   
It scared the shit out of me .
Water sprayed , cutting through the smoke , as cold as the air was hot .   
With that , there was a moment where others could see Lung , and Lung could see them .
Everything told me to run , that we had to evacuate .
Goddess- if the stories about her were to be believed , if the refugees from her world were telling the truth , then her world would suffer for her return .   
I could n’t really buy it , the long list of ifs , but it was the most critical way of parsing things .
If Teacher won , if we could n’t beat Lung and keep Teacher from getting what he wanted , then none of the worlds would be okay .
We could n’t run .
Water splashed Lung , and water became stone .   
I flew at him , catching a large piece of rubble on the way .   
My aim was to fly by him , to smack him with two or three hundred pounds of concrete .   
Then I saw the blade of silver carving its way through the air , leaving a trail behind it , as it left its mark on smoke particles , making them more prone to splitting .
It caught Lung across the belly , and I closed in , ready to deliver the final blow .
Lung leaped up , wings flapping .
Disappearing into the smoke and darkness .
I flew after him .
By the time I found him , the mark on his stomach was gone .   
He cast flame down toward the ground , and this time there was no reason for the pharmacist to extinguish it .
To distract him , I flew at him .   
I used my aura , and it touched the purple fire on the ground .   
Where Lung ’s fire extended down , purple fire raced back up , cascading up the trails left behind each blast , climbing higher , higher , expanding as I fed it with my aura , until he had to stop for a moment to let it all dissipate .
Then I had his focus .   
Two spears and one stalagmite of rock floated in the air beside me , gripped by invisible hands .   
One was gripped so tight it was going to break in the middle .
The others could n’t help me here .   
We ’d driven him to the air where only a few people could challenge him .
We .   
It was a corny thing , too belated when Byron had ducked inside , used his power from a window , probably .   
When Rain had been on the periphery , firing mostly blind into smoke and fire , and when Goddess had very understandably been caught up with the trials of directing an unruly group of prisoners .
But we ’d been stronger as a group .   
We were too fractured .
I watched Lung , my eyes burning with contact on the air , no doubt more red than white after all the trace contact with smoke .   
The air was relatively clear here , and my vision was still bleary , my eyes like sandpaper .   
My mouth hung open , so dry and layered with films of smoke that I did n’t dare swallow , for fear of choking .
I saw his head turn .   
Then he dove .
I pursued .   
I had to .
One hundred and ten percent .   
Giving my all .
All of the Wretch- the moment his focus was n’t entirely on me , I flew after .   
He flew with wings and power .   
I flew with something freer , impulse , something from within me .
The moment I was about to close , driving my spear - points into his wing , he tucked his wing in , rolling through the air .   
Eyes , mouth , and the cracks between the segments of his body glowed red .
Fire exploded through the air around him as he continued to plummet .
The Wretch heaved the spears at him .   
One hit him , the other two were duds .
It was frustrating
but I accepted the frustration .   
Tears streaked my face from the smoke - stained eyes .
His wings unfolded , their breadth catching his weight , arresting his descent .
I plummeted past him .
One hundred and ten percent of the Warrior Monk .
I used my aura .   
Calculated , watching for the danger , where the purple fire was .
I provoked him , because I knew he was easily provoked , even in this state .   
As mighty as he could be , this got past scale and muscle and it bothered him .
He sent out another cascade of flame .   
I changed direction to avoid it , realized it was too wide in scope to escape , and let the Wretch absorb the blow instead .
Except the fire kept coming .   
I accelerated my downward plummet , heading toward the building where , in another situation , I could have hoped to use that building for cover .
Here , I did the opposite .
The fire chased me , filling the air around me and to either side of me .   
I headed away , headed down , the lip of the building ’s roof so near to me that my breastplate periodically scraped against it .   
He cut off the fire .
I looked back , and I saw him maneuvering .   
He turned his attention to the others , to my team .
He wanted to stay near the purple flame .   
It secured him against most of the powers that could stop him .   
And … I had to let him .
He was a brute , and brutes had a way of forcing you to deal with them .
The thought made me think of Dean .
There was a strength in that , a part of that one hundred and ten percent .   
The Victoria Dallon part of me .
I ’d never fought when I felt this low .   
Even at the community center , I had n’t been as tired , as caught up in multiple things .   
At the Fallen camp , I ’d had hopes , and I ’d been more singular of purpose .   
I ’d been able to focus on the others .
Here , the challenge was me .   
Figuring out how to be strong when I needed to be strong .
I went through a window , turning my back on Lung , aware that I might be letting Byron and Rain burn .
I tapped the Wretch , and I tore through a wall .
The scholar .   
I ’d been trying to track where the flames were and where the Pharmacist operated .   
I ’d been dimly aware of Lung ’s favored position .   
He knew where she was and by operating within a certain area , he gave clues .
That had narrowed it down .
That he had n’t been willing to throw out fire and hit this side of the building , abandoning his pursuit of me ?
The Wretch came back .   
I went through another wall .
Bystanders .   
They were huddled together .   
A guard had cuffs on , binding him to a cot .
“
Where is she ?
”
I asked .
I saw them exchange glances .   
The guard looked back , off to the side , more in the way I ’d come .
I flew back through the hole in the wall , then through the open door to the hallway .
I cut a path through the staff building , no running footsteps or pants of breath to impede my hearing .   
I swallowed and choked back a cough .   
Then I flew more , silent .   
My hand slapped against a wall as I used it to stop myself sooner , so I could fly down a different hallway .
I heard her running footsteps .
Me , the scholar , working out powers .   
The Patrol lieutenant , investigating , keeping an eye out for the troublemaker .
It was n’t about finding that one part of me and executing it beyond perfectly .   
The Warrior Monk , the Wretch , the Scholar , the Girl .
All together .
“ While you ’re running , you ’re not helping Lung , ” I called out .   
I pushed out with my aura .
I escalated the pressure .
“
He needs you !
”   
My voice rang through the hallways of the staff building .
More aura .   
More fear .
Then I heard it , saw it .   
A flash of purple .   
The aura igniting .   
I canceled the aura , but that did n’t stop the fire that had already been created .   
In an enclosed space I had to duck , throwing myself around a corner , hood pulled down .   
My feet thudded against the ground as I stopped flying .
It swept past me .
“
You just told me where you are !
”
I called out .   
I ran .
There was no fear aura , but there was more panic now .   
She cast fire out behind her , blocking the path .
I took another route , going out the window , around the side of the building .   
One window was open , and I flew in through it , muddy boots skidding on tile .
An electric whine caught my attention .
Teacher ’s tinkers , protecting the woman .   
I saw her past them , looking at me .   
She ’d learned her lesson from previous encounters , and she kept her fire put away .   
There would be no blowing it up with my aura , getting her minions in the process .
I flew away , instead .
Mom told me to focus on the objective .   
What does the enemy want ?
She wanted away , to get back to where she could help Lung .
Lung wanted to be strong , to stay near the purple fire , to take over this prison for Teacher , presumably because he was getting paid , or because he was a Teacher thrall .
Out through the window , around the building … in through a window with a crash .
Another thrall , an older guy .   
He was slow to react , slower with my aura blasting out .   
I shoved him against the wall on my way through the door , and slapped his tinker gun away .   
The Wretch demolished it in passing .
The mission .   
There was a dangerous feeling of triumph when it felt like I was taking the bad guys down a peg , dismantling their plans .   
The tag team was disrupted .   
She was running , and I was catching up .
She ’d gone downstairs , I realized .
My aura burned , pressuring her .   
“
You ’ve lost , if you ’ve abandoned Lung .   
Does that mean you do n’t get paid ?   
Or will Teacher be disappointed ?   
How does this work , Pharmacist ! ?
”
“ Shut up !
”
I heard her .
I lunged to one side , and then the Wretch tore through the floor .   
I came down on top of her , catching her while she was bent over , shielding herself from the debris that was falling down on top of her .   
I shoved her into the ground , hard .
I had spikes on my glove , that started at rings on the fingers and extended back toward my wrist , almost flat against my hand .   
The points now rested against the most vulnerable part of her throat .
I saw her expression change .   
Ten emotions in a matter of two or three seconds .
“
Do n’t even think about it , ”
I told her .
“
More will come , ” she said .   
“
He has an army .
”
“
And we have you , ” I said .   
I reached up to my shoulder , my finger tracing the spikes there .   
Nothing .   
I checked my breastplate , where tines radiated up from the icon just above my sternum .   
I found a loose one and snapped it off .
The point still pressed against her throat , I led her to a standing position .   
Then we walked , me holding the long spire of gold - layered steel against her jugular .
Fires still burned when we stepped out of the building , but the battle was over .   
Goddess had brought others , and they all stood by .   
Byron and Rain were sitting down on rubble , and Rain gave me a bob of the head in greeting as he saw me .   
There might have been a smile behind Byron ’s mask .
I spotted Kenzie off to the side .   
Still with Monokeros .   
She gave me a small wave as she saw me .   
At the back , people were guarding Natalie along with the three heads of the prison staff .   
Two were Teacher ’s .   
One was ours .
Behind Goddess … it looked like she ’d collected most of the prisoners .   
I could see Seir and other Fallen .   
Coalbelcher and his second in command .   
I saw Damsel .
No Crystalclear .   
No Ratcatcher .   
No Sveta .   
No Ashley .
Lung stood by Goddess .   
He folded his arms as I brought the Pharmacist nearer .
Goddess approached , standing square in front of the Pharmacist .   
I lowered the point of the tine from the Pharmacist ’s throat , then backed off .
The Pharmacist and Goddess stared each other down .   
Everyone around us seemed okay with this .
I started to approach Lookout .   
Rain got my attention , a motion of the hand , followed by a shake of the head .
I went to Rain and Byron instead , my arms folded .   
Breathing hurt .   
I was pretty sure the Wretch had filtered out a lot of smoke , but it had n’t filtered out all of it .   
Even now , the smoke was heavy in the air .
“
You serve me now , ” Goddess told the Pharmacist .
“
Yeah , ” the Pharmacist replied .
“
You ’ll tell me about the drugs you brought into the prison .
”
“
Taken to the cafeteria , to be applied to the food .   
A berserker formula .   
Turning everyone he could n’t use into ravening monsters .
”
“ She ’s lying , ” a woman in the crowd said .
I could see the Pharmacist tense .
“
It ’s a power nullifying chemical , ” the same woman said .   
She stepped forward .   
Words were tattooed beneath her eyes , so they traced straight lines down to her jaw .   
‘ Crock’ and ‘ Shit’ .   
Colorful , for words in black ink .   
More ink put scales at her arms and neck .   
“ Nullifying your influence , Goddess .
”
“
And you took some , ” Goddess told the Pharmacist .
“ She did .   
And she already got some to key prisoners , ” Crock o Shit said .   
“
The maximum security ones , who get meals delivered .
”
Purple fire surrounded the Pharmacist ’s hands .   
She reached for Goddess , and she made it one step before someone swung a guard
’s baton into her throat .   
She fell to the ground , fire extinguished .
“ If she does n’t suffocate from that , let her live , ” Goddess said .   
“ The drugs will wear off .
”
The crowd was pretty eager to drag the Pharmacist off .   
Goddess turned her attention to Lung .   
“
Did you take the drug ?
”
He shook his head .
“
Truth , ” Crock o Shit said .
“
He regenerates , ” I said .   
“
Drugs have reduced effect .
”
Lung nodded .
Weird to be on the same side as him now .
“
The guards are dealt with , but Teacher is n’t going to leave it at this , ” Goddess said .   
“
And we still have some loose ends to tie up .
”
I did n’t miss the fact that she made eye contact with me , with Byron and Rain .
She was thinking about our teammates .
“
Get organized , ” she told us .








“ Antares , ” Goddess said .
I felt a little bit of fear and awe as I stopped re - wrapping my bandage and turned to face her .
“
Good work , ” she said .   
“
You ’re mercurial , but you can be pretty fucking useful .   
If you wanted it , I could bring you to my world , and give you a lesser country .
”
“
A country , wow , ” Rain said , beside me .
“ I do n’t think I ’m mercurial ,
” I said , frowning a bit .   
“
And I ’m grateful for the offer
but … I ’m
a city girl .   
I ’d rather help the Megalopolis , and if it comes down to it , make sure people here support you too .
”
“
It would n’t work that way .   
Something ’s bothering me .   
So far you and your team have been on top of things .   
Tell me something about the current attack .
”
“
We did n’t get all of them .   
There are two more to deal with .   
Blindside-
you ca n’t look at them .   
Ca n’t aim at them .
”
“ They would be the reason my danger sense is limited .
”
“
Probably .   
Stymied ?
”
“
Interfered with .   
I ca n’t extend it past a certain range .   
It ’s worse since I ’ve moved in this direction .
”
A motion of her arm indicated the direction traveled .
“
That ’s the access tunnels , is n’t it ?
” Byron asked .
Our teammates .   
Teacher had sent Blindside straight there .
“ We need to go , ” I said .
“
Stay , ”
Goddess said , her voice firm .
My jaw clenched .   
I nodded .   
“
Sorry .
”
“
Tell me about the other , ” she said .   
“
Two of Teacher ’s powered got through ?
”
“ At least .   
The other was Kingdom Come .   
He detonates himself into a shower of blood and meat .   
Anyone who comes into contact with it is his puppet .   
He reforms after .
”
“ I think I ’ve met him , or one of his bloodstained puppets .   
They would n’t align to my purposes .   
One of Teacher ’s many counters to me .
”
“
He ’s a mercenary .   
It ’s possible that he might accept your offer of a country .
”
“
He sounds religious , ” Rain said .   
“ Name like that .
”
“ Could be , ” I said .   
“ We should go .   
If Blindside is in the access tunnels-
”
“
You ’ll stay for a few minutes .   
I may need you for something else , ” Goddess told us .
“
The access tunnels are the communication outlet to the outside world .   
They may also be the override to the bomb anklets .   
This is important .
”
“
My danger sense , blind as it is , tells me we have other priorities .   
If your teammates were in danger , I think I would feel it .   
Stay .
” We had done more than our share of the work when it came to taking down Lung and the Pharmacist , and we were , putting it lightly , exhausted .   
I did n’t like staying , but I did n’t mind the chance to recuperate .   
I felt like I ’d been wrung out , then baked too long over an open fire .   
I had n’t even properly used my muscles , and I felt completely and utterly drained .
Goddess walked over to discuss things with Lung , and others were organizing into battle lines and squads , breaking away to go wrangle remaining guards and staff .   
I saw Natalie among the wrangled .
I hesitated a moment , wondering if I ’d do more harm than good , then broke away from Rain and Byron .   
If I was close enough for Goddess to find , then that had to be good enough .   
But I could n’t leave Natalie .
“ I ’ll be right back .   
Get my attention if there ’s trouble .
”
“
Sure , ” Byron said .
A reality with parahumans was that most who triggered were young – people as young as twelve could trigger , with the upper range being thirty .   
There was a possibility for a few years of leeway , trending more toward the rare parahuman being younger than a parahuman being older .
The guys in this particular prison clique were young .   
It was shocking to see people Rain and Chris’ ages .
“ Do n’t hurt or bother them , ” I told the prisoners , my eye stopping on Natalie for a meaningful moment , trying to communicate something to her .   
That I was on her side .   
That if she had anything to say , now was the time to say it .
She said nothing .   
Maybe to avoid drawing attention to herself .
And the prisoners , for their part , were equally silent .   
I felt put on the spot , and I felt so drained physically , mentally , and emotionally that I could have been bowled over by hard words .   
Tension kept me upright .
I had n’t gotten a response , so I elaborated .   
“
Goddess may need them as bargaining chips , or to get access to parts of the prison .   
If you screw that up , touch them , or scare them and get them panicking instead of thinking rationally , then it screws us all up .
”
Believe me , I put my heart into the mental command .   
Buy this , even though I do n’t sound nearly as authoritative as I might want .   
Do n’t make me use my aura in this volatile a place .
“ I do n’t see why you get to tell us what to do , ” a boy said .   
He had the sharp chin , widow ’s peak with a curl of hair at the forehead , and natural bad - boy glare of a classic kid ’s show villain , but he had to be my age .
He also , judging by the group ’s dynamic , had a few people under his wing .   
Underlings .   
He was the leader of this sub - clique .
“
Do you really want to test me and find out ?
” I asked .   
I sounded more steely now .   
A bit more of my old self .
He stared me down , then dropped his eyes to my arm .   
I was n’t sure if he was seeing an injury , a clue that I was n’t invincible , until he gestured .
“
That symbol on your arm .
”
Worked into the metal at my shoulder was a golden circle inside another circle , centered at about the midpoint between bicep and shoulder .   
The five parallel spikes stabbed up from it .
“ Gold Morning , ” I said .
“ Then you were there .   
That ’s the thing people put on their sleeves , if they were there or if they played a part .
”
“ Some do n’t put anything on their sleeves , but they were there .   
Lung , Goddess , ” I said .   
“
Why ?
”
“
You put it there for a reason , right ?
”
“ Everyone has their reasons for wearing the armbands , ” I said .   
I worried I sounded defensive .   
Again , I asked , “
Why ?
”
“
I ’m not going to test you or test her , ” he said .   
“
Out of respect for that .
”
There were a few nods around his group .   
One or two looked unsure , like the stupider , less ‘ together’ members of the group were n’t sure if it was for real .
I was n’t sure I believed it was for real .
“
Good man , ” I said , deciding there was no way to hammer it out .   
I met Natalie ’s eyes momentarily before turning away .
Nothing from her in the way of signals .   
Damn it .
I went back to Rain and Byron , walking past a group that was preparing for the possibility of a frontal assault by Teacher .   
Others were preparing to deal with the maximum security individuals who had apparently been given the Pharmacist ’s drugs .   
An attack from within , an attack from the outside , and then there was Teacher , who had the ability to hit us from oblique angles .
I wanted to ask Kenzie for a status report , but that meant approaching Monokeros .   
I wanted to ask the boys , but they were talking to Coalbelcher .
I checked my phone three times in the course of a single minute , even though I knew that all communications were jammed .   
It was a force of habit , a creeping anxiety as we went longer and longer without any input from the other half of Breakthrough .
I had a lot of anxieties in this moment .   
The small - scale victory with Lung and the Pharmacist only went so far .
Byron and Rain exchanged a few muttered words as they walked over from where Coalbelcher was .
“
You apparently made an impression , ” Byron said .
I frowned .   
“ With Coalbelcher ?
”
“
He said you said you ’d get him out .   
I thought we had a problem when he called us over , but he ’s changed his tune .   
Us being right about the danger of the cafeteria helped , ” Rain said .
“ I did n’t say I ’d get him out .   
But I let him believe it .   
It could have backfired , come down on your head , if he did n’t think I at least tried , if this whole thing wrapped up , and then he ended up frustrated , with only you as a target .
”
“
It worked out , ” Rain said , almost like he was assuring me .   
Then , quieter , he said , “ One of the few things that has .
”
I followed their line of sight as they both turned back to look at someone .   
Seir in his civilian clothes , mask off .   
The man was of a similar type to Coalbelcher , but without the long stubble on his face sticking in every direction .   
His hair was longer with some gray already in it , the circles under his eyes were black for reasons other than the coal - spit facepaint .   
The tattoos gave him away .
“
Seir , ” I observed .
“
He ’s not a fan of us , ” Byron said .   
“
We ’re all on the same side , but that does n’t mean he does n’t want to get back at us .
”
“ At me , ” Rain said .   
“
I do n’t think it ’s an immediate problem , but if we have any choice in where we go , we should go wherever he is n’t .
”
“ Agreed , ” I said , as I looked over at Lookout and Monokeros .   
They were with another group , Lookout hanging a half - step back while Monokeros talked with some scary - looking women .   
Monokeros was currently listening , as another woman did all of the talking .   
The talker was pretty where her skin was intact , but had what looked scars from a bad burn extending all the way down her neck .   
Another woman stood beside her , top already removed , torn up into shreds , and the shreds plaited into a cord .   
The cord was being knotted into a hangman ’s noose .
The other two had noticed I was looking .
“
What about her ?
” I asked .   
“
Why did you not want me to approach Lookout ?
”
“
Lookout came on a little strong with the Lady in Blue , ” Rain said .   
“
It made her suspicious .   
She ’s suspicious of you too , you know , but she knows she can beat you .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“ Monokeros though ?
”
“ If you ’ve got a canary you ’re worried about and a cat that ’s restless , and you ’re really good at managing your animals , which we know she is
, maybe you give the canary a cat babysitter , ” Rain suggested .
“ That does n’t make me feel better , ” I said .
“ It does n’t make us feel that much better , ” Rain said .   
“
But we can trust that the Lady in Blue knows what she ’s doing , we know from what Swansong says that Monokeros is really messed up and touchy , and we do n’t disturb that scene while it ’s peaceful .
” I frowned .   
Monokeros was smiling now .   
I was creeped out by something in how she presented herself , but I could n’t tell if it was because of something ugly in her peeking out , the contrast in her charmer attitude with the tattoos like the triangle at her forehead , making me think of- of   certain individuals , or if it was because I knew that she ’d gone full ritual killer , killing heroes , kids .   
Hopeful young Vistas , Shielders , and Finales .   
Kids who had faced the worst days of their lives and came out the other end wanting to help people .
“
She was corporate , like Tristan and me , ” Byron said .   
“ Goldenrod .
”
“
Yeah , ” I acknowledged .
Byron went on .   
“ Started her own team , talked it up , but it never seemed to get off the ground .   
Too many kids went missing , but they still did n’t zero in on her .   
The masks , the secret identities , they make it so the kids cover up her tracks for her , making it harder to draw the connection .
”
“ Families too , ” Rain said .   
“
Uhm , Jessica said something about this to me at one point .   
That people with powers tend to have worse relationships with their family .
”
“ If they had good support systems , they ’d be less likely to trigger , ” I said .
“
Yeah , ” Byron said .   
“
Exactly .   
They did n’t catch her until the second kid who left a message with people letting them know she was interviewing with a team .   
They brought a different thinker for the interview with her , second time around .   
The first one was an inquisitor type , sensed wrongs , guilt , saw memories that haunted people , used them or summoned them .
”
“ Summoned , ” I said .   
“
And she had nothing to summon .
”
“
Ah , you know the story then .   
I was wondering if it was just the talk shared between the corporate teams , ” Byron said .
“
No .   
It was the talk in general .   
Among capes , at least .
”
A horror story among capes .
Byron nodded .
Monokeros smiled .   
It was the kind of smile that was practiced , then reused so many times it looked natural .   
A model ’s smile .   
The smile of a hero who lived off of their brand , like the corporate and sponsored heroes , and maybe the small family teams with an up - and - coming generation of youths .
“
She reminds me of- of someone , ” Byron said .   
“
Not all the time , but there- ”
A crash interrupted him , and with that crash , a dozen powers nearby flared into effect .   
I was already in the air , flying up to where I could activate the Wretch without annihilating two of my teammates .
It was Goddess .   
With her power , she was tearing a building to the ground .
Once people realized it was her , they relaxed .   
I took their cue , floating back down to the ground and my two teammates .
“
What ’s she doing ?
” Byron murmured .
With the disorientation of the fight and the change in the landscape around us , it took me a second to place where we were , and what that building might ’ve been .   
It was one of the prison buildings , but not an apartment , and given the proximity to the yard , equal access from both sides … “ The cafeteria .   
With all of the anti - Goddess meds in it , ” Rain said .   
“
That ’s a bit of a relief .   
Simplifies things .
”
I nodded , silent .
Better .
Goddess turned her head around until she found our group .   
She beckoned .
As glad as I was to stay put , I was glad to be moving .   
We had an objective .
While Rain and Byron walked , me floating just ahead of the pair , Goddess turned , beckoning to others .   
To Lookout and Monokeros .   
Then to Damsel , to Ashley ’s ‘ sister’ .
I looked back for Natalie , and saw her in the company of the other staff that had been taken into custody .   
It was a dangerous atmosphere , with the guard - prisoner relationship reversed , and a lot of dangerous prisoners around .   
Monokeros was of a certain kind of evil , but she was n’t the only evil person around here .   
If one of those people decided to hurt Natalie , would anyone stop them ?
“
Breakthrough , ”
Goddess said .   
She looked at Damsel , who was approaching .   
“
In a sense .
”
“ Most of us , ” Lookout said .   
Then she leaned over to greet Byron , Rain and me with a , “ Hi .
”
“ You can have a luxury vehicle , and you can get your luxury vehicle with all of the extras , ” Damsel said , raising her chin a little , claws moving at her side .   
“
Both are good .
”
“ I do n’t care , ” Goddess said , annoyed .   
“
My danger sense is telling me something ’s coming , and it ’s not the kind of danger I have a lot of experience with .   
Destroying the drugs did n’t help .   
I think Teacher is doing something , and you have the most information about him and what he ’s doing .   
Solve it .
”
“ We need more information than that , ” I said .   
“
What is your danger sense telling you ?   
How does it function ?
”
“
My power is a feeling , ” she said .   
“
It can come from a direction .   
It tastes of intent .   
It has flavors depending on the kind of danger .   
This tastes hollow , and it feels big .   
There ’s no direction to it .   
The opposite , the lack of direction is the danger .
”
“
Have you felt anything like this before ?
” I asked .
“
I felt something roughly this big once .   
It was when the world was ending .   
The golden man .
”
I drew in a deep breath , looking at the others .   
They seemed about as alarmed by that as I was .
“
You said it ’s big .   
World ending …
but this is a small world .   
One penal colony , ” Rain suggested .
“ When I was pulled into a battlefield , that world was small too , Precipice .   
The scale is similar .
”
“
Broken trigger ?
” Byron suggested .
“
The powers that have gone wild ? ”
Goddess asked .   
“
It could be .   
But even that would feel it has direction .   
An enemy , or a power source .
”
“ We ’ve heard of incidents where one person became a very large - scale effect .   
The kind that would cover this whole colony , and then some , ” I said .   
“
I think the catch is that most precogs and danger sensers ca n’t see triggers coming , even broken ones .
”
Goddess shook her head , but she did n’t offer anything specific that would clarify matters .   
I felt my heartbeat accelerate some , just from seeing her this concerned .
“
I ’ve felt this directionless threat before , ” she said .   
“
It was after I came into my power , before I ’d exercised it and learned its limits .   
Someone came for me .   
A monster , but the bitch looked human .   
She sent me to Shin .   
To give this feeling a name … it ’s inevitability .   
A doom through a nearly complete and total lack of options .
”
“ Inevitable doom , affecting this whole world ?
”
Rain asked .   
“ Hollow ?
”
“ Hollow , with a bloody aftertaste .   
I ’ve never felt a hollow doom before , ” Goddess said .   
“
Maybe one of you has .   
Figure this out , now .
”
“
I ’m an expert in worlds ending , traps , and being doomed .   
Been hearing about it for years , sometimes my whole life , ” Rain said .   
“
Has it been inching closer all night ?
”
“ I stopped looking when the purple fire blinded me , there was nothing before then .   
I started looking after , and it was there .   
Are there more questions ?   
If you ca n’t give me an answer , I ’ll ask others .
”
There was a pause .   
We shook our heads .
Goddess used her telekinesis to lift herself off the ground , flying past the mud to another group that was at the admin building .
“
No reports on Teacher ?
”
I asked Lookout .
“
No ,
but I ’ve been distracted .   
Our guys on the far side are just about out of gas .   
He ’s got guys massed
but he ’s waiting instead of sending them in .
”
“ Backup for the big gun ?
” I asked .
“
Except not a gun , ” Damsel said .   
She moved her hand , one blade extended , the tips of the other folding loosely around it .   
She winked at me .   
“ Guns can be dealt with by bigger guns .
”
“
Uh , yeah ,
” I said .
“
Could it be an Endbringer ?
” Rain asked .
“ Jesus , ” Byron said .   
“ Do n’t even joke .   
They ’ve been dormant .
”
“ They ca n’t be predicted easily with danger sense either , ” I said .
“
I ’m trying to think of things big enough .   
It ’d be embarrassing to be the kid who grew up in an Endbringer cult who does n’t think of Endbringers when we ’re debating possible apocalypse scenarios .   
Seven plagues ?   
The four horsemen ?
”
“ I like Death , ” Damsel said .   
“
He has style .
”
“ Back when I was a hometown hero , my-
we joked about the Undersiders being the four horsemen .   
Guy in black with the skull , girl with the locusts , girl with the howling hellhounds and spiked collar , and the guy who controlled people .
”
“ You lost me with that last one , ” Byron said .   
“
And I ’ve actually read the bible .
”
“
Depending on interpretations , the guy in white is seen as either Conquest or Famine , ” Rain said .
“
Oh , like Conquest from the Toronto segment from the Maggie Holt series !
”
Lookout said , all excitement now that she was back in the conversation .   
She took a step forward , and Monokeros reached out , seizing her by the shoulder .
Everyone present reacted in some way to that .   
Even Damsel .
“
You stay with me , camera girl .   
Goddess’ orders , ” Monokeros said .   
She did n’t look the slightest bit worried that the rest of us were poised like we might use powers or throw a punch , given an excuse .
“
Okay , ” Lookout said , to Monokeros .   
Then she said , “ I liked that book , even though a lot of people did n’t .
”
“ I listened to the audiobook , ” Damsel said .
“
Yes !   
Yes !   
That ’s great
, you ’re great , and of course , I ’m stating the obvious by saying that- ” “ Of course .   
Glad to see someone with a brain .
”
“ We need our brains focused on figuring out what Teacher ’s disaster scenario is , not in , uh , asserting the obvious , ” I said .
“
Two people with brains .   
I ’m starting to see why she likes you all .
”
I kept talking ,
“
I ’m glad you guys are developing a friendship , but let ’s think .   
The sooner we work it out , the sooner we can help our teammates .   
That includes Swansong and Tress .
”
“
It might be famine , ” Rain said .
“ Famine ?
” I asked .
“
She said it was hollow , and it was something Goddess never experienced or knew .   
Inevitable , if he sets it up right .   
And it destroys her .   
She was probably going after the feeling when she destroyed the food stock
…
but if we get desperate enough , people are going to dig out the food , contaminated , they ’ll ingest the drug , and … ”
“
And Teacher gets everything he wants , ” I said .
“
It ’s a siege .   
Not catapults and walls siege , but a starve the other guy out siege , ” Rain said .   
“
People back at the compound were always taking measures to plan for scenarios like this .
”
“
There ’s nothing but wilderness around us , ” Byron said .
“
To feed an entire prison ?   
Indefinitely ?   
Knowing that you ca n’t roam too far when the bombs could reactivate at any time ?   
Maybe , but I do n’t think it ’s that easy .   
I can totally see Teacher picking off people who go hunting with portals and hit squads .
”
Okay , I could buy that .   
It made sense .
“
It does n’t make sense , ” Lookout said .   
“
I have the keys .   
He might have broken down the front door , but so long as I ’m lensing the space - map , it ’s my door .   
Any doors he puts down are going to end up fizzling .
”
“
It might be your door , but there ’s nothing stopping him from dropping a mountain on top of it and then taking his time working out a solution later , ” Byron said .
“
Like you did with Lung , ” Damsel said .   
“ Clever .
”
“
That was my brother , actually , but-
yes .   
Kind of .
”
“ We need Goddess , ” I said .   
“
And we need to deal with this without getting tied up with the max - sec guys , Kingdom Come , Blindside …
I ’ll get her .
”
How do you defeat someone with world - spanning powers ?   
You make sure she never gets a chance to fight .
I flew over to where Goddess was talking to Seir .   
I saw his expression change as he recognized me .   
I ignored it , focusing on Goddess instead .
“ We have a guess about what he ’s doing , ” I said .   
“
If he keeps us from leaving , there ’s no food that is n’t contaminated .   
Everyone here starves … or we eat , and we might ingest the drugs that the pharmacist planted .
”
I saw something in her eyes .   
Alarm .   
Bewilderment .
She took over an Earth .   
She … did whatever she ’d done to take over her cluster , and that ca n’t have been easy .   
Then there was Gold Morning , but … the entire reason she was here and not in her world was because she had been pulled into the fight .   
I could one hundred percent understand how she might not have made many calls then .   
It could seem like a strange , bad dream , realer than existence in the years before and after , but so hard to parse that the mind turned away from it .
But this might well have been the first time she ’d ever come head to head with the fact that she was well and truly outmatched , while she was well and truly in control of her actions , past present and upcoming .
“
How does he do it ?
”
“ We do n’t know , but you said it yourself , it felt
like- ” “
No way out .   
We evacuate .
”
“
He has a small army ready on the other side of the door , we , the non - Goddess good guys , have multiple teams there trying to stall Teacher .   
The max - sec guys are probably under orders to attack us from the rear , if we try to run for it , and the access tunnel-
” “ Stop , ” she told me .   
“ Fucking enough .
”
“ The access tunnel leads to a means to communicate with the outside , and links the prison resources to outside resources .   
It gives him a way to tap into the ankle bombs your army is wearing .   
My teammates , Goddess !
”
“ I do n’t care !
” she retorted .   
Her voice was less of a shout as she spoke again , more of a hiss , “ We evacuate .   
Figure this out .   
Yes ?
”
I was still , my thoughts stuck as I tried to figure out a way to reconcile it .   
So many of the options available meant throwing away lives .
Her stare was cold .
She found world leaders and went after them one by one .   
She sank ships .   
She killed hundreds , even thousands . 
 
The eyes of someone that had killed thousands .
All around me , killers , terrorists , kidnappers and worse were staring at Goddess and me .
“ Figure it out , ”
she said , with more emphasis .
She stared into my eyes .
I was stuck , my thoughts tied in a knot , as I processed the options available to me .   
Follow the law .   
When the law is n’t available , do what ’s right .   
When what ’s right is n’t clear , ask for help .
The team ?   
I could manage the team , we ’d figure something out .   
But that did nothing about the people who were still in various forms of trouble .   
We still had n’t heard from the A - team , down in the access tunnels .   
Natalie was still in the custody of Goddess’ squad .   
Lookout was still in Monokeros’ grasp .
This was the trap .   
All of the puzzle pieces from Teacher ’s riddle were coming together in this .   
The nonlethal weapons .   
The anti - air weapon he ’d employed against me , they could well prevent Goddess from taking flight and making a break for it .
And the attacks she ’d described- multiple fronts , multiple angles , multiple levels .   
We could n’t ignore the access tunnels and the control of the bombs they promised .   
We could n’t ignore the front door , or our rear , or the issue of basic needs , like needing to eat .
“ Give me an answer , Antares , ” Goddess said .   
“
Can you figure this out , or are you going to get in my way ?
”
“ I ’ll work on figuring something out , ” I said .
She nodded slowly , still staring into my eyes .
“
Sorry to be so intense , ” I said .
“
Good , ” she said .   
“
Which buildings are the maximum security buildings ?
”
“ The short , squat ones at the far north of the complex , ” I said .
“ He fed his drugs to the people there ?
”
“ They get their food delivered , and the guards make sure they take their pills , ” Seir said , behind Goddess .   
“
I ’m borderline .   
Max sec
if I ’ve been anything but good .   
So I know .
”
Seir was staring at me .   
He seemed to be amused that I was facing down Goddess like this
and I was n’t coming out ahead .   
That , or he was just enjoying himself , and he looked like an asshole as a separate , distinct thing .
Asshole .
Goddess , for her part , seemed to be focusing on the horizon , where the shape of buildings was only barely visible against the backdrop of sky and distant trees .   
Many of the buildings did n’t have lights on .
I could feel her telekinesis like a harsh blast of wind right after a vehicle passed by .   
The force in the air was even more pronounced along the course of the blast , lines and fractal images briefly visible as air compressed , moisture condensed , and light bent .
In the distance , one of the buildings toppled .
“ That ’ll get them moving , ” she said .   
“
Seir , gather everyone you know .   
Deal with them , knock down buildings and render this place uninhabitable as you come back from doing that .   
We burn our bridges behind us .
”
I saw the smile on Seir ’s face .   
I looked away .
I took off , heading straight up to where I could hopefully get my bearings , and where I would n’t have to see a Fallen who reveled in being Fallen being happy with the status quo .   
It made it easier to think straight and set my mind to the task at hand .
Below me , Goddess was joined by some of the prison ’s heavier hitters .   
Not any of the heavy hitters I needed .   
Lung was at her left shoulder , his eye glowing a dull red as he glanced up at me .   
The scales had mostly receded .
I could remember Dean , in the hospital after Leviathan .   
I zig - zagged through the crowd , trying to see people in gloom and slanted lighting .   
I was looking for a specific body type , hair type , and face , but the prison coveralls masked physical shapes .
Master - stranger protocols felt so hollow in the now .   
The team was compromised , the medicated food was buried under a fallen building , and that food came from Teacher .   
I was n’t sure I trusted it or the master - stranger protocols
more than I trusted Goddess .
My zig - zagging journey continued , haunted by the memory of what had laid at the end of my last such journey .   
Then , I ’d been searching for the one face who might be able to help , and I ’d been crushed on so many levels by the failure to find .
In this , I was n’t even sure the face was an answer .
I spotted the others .   
I landed , and in my current state of mind , I forgot how much the heat , the aerial acrobatics , and the earlier fight with the teacher hit squad and the Major Malfunctions had drained me .   
I nearly dropped to my knees .   
Nothing like my fancy landings of days past .
“
What are we doing ?
” Byron asked .
“
She wants to go out the front door , unless she gets another , better answer before she gives the order .   
Teacher ’s going to be waiting for her .   
Byron , you remember the tools her people had .   
For dealing with fliers .   
Nonlethal weapons , that could capture the fallen .
”
“ And
let Teacher get them under his thumb , ” Byron said .   
“ Shit .   
You ’re right .
”
“ We need to get Goddess out unscathed somehow .   
From her tone , I think she ’s willing to make any sacrifices necessary to save herself .
”
“ Makes sense , ” Damsel said .   
“
I ’d be willing to do the same if I was in her position .
”
“
Uh , yeah ,
” I said .   
“
Not sure about that .
”
“
So how do we save her skin , ideally without sacrificing ourselves ?
” Damsel asked .
“ You guys need to get to the others , ” I said .   
“
If they have n’t come back yet , there ’s a reason .   
I ’ll catch up .   
We get the team together , make sure we ’re all on the same page , and then we make our effort to escape .   
We lean on-
”
I almost said protocols .   
It struck me that Monokeros , as dangerous and deluded as she was , could very well know the protocols , know what I meant , despite my efforts to be subtle .
“ -We
lean on each other , ” I said .   
“
We know who we can trust .
”
“
Myself and myself , ” Damsel said .   
She paused .   
“
And maybe the little one .
”
“ Woo ! ”
“
Lookout , ” Rain said .   
“
If we un - lens or whatever , is it possible that we could use one of Teacher ’s doors to make our exit ?
”
“ I do n’t know , ” she said .   
“
But just from what my phone says , I ’m pretty sure he closed all the doors .
”
I saw Rain grimace .
“
Talk while you run , but time is short .   
Go , ” I said .
“
And what are you doing ?
” Byron asked .
“ Looking for Coalbelcher , ” I said .
“
Coalbelcher ?
”
“ I think we can use him , ” I said .   
“
Do you-
”
The ground illuminated as though a spotlight was being directed at it , but the light was neon , the edges of things highlighted and then multiplied .
I looked around , and I saw the source .
The first of the max sec prisoners .   
The dangerous ones that needed to be kept away from gen pop .   
The ones who Teacher had reached out to personally .
“
Go !   
Avoid those guys , avoid eerie glowing ground !
”
“
He went that way !
”
Rain raised his voice and pointed , as the ground began screaming .   
I took to the air , and I could see how the distorted lights were whisking and whirring against one another , like worms in a tangle .   
There were shapes like people inside , writ large .
I thought about going after the guy with the shaker effect .   
I decided it was too dangerous .   
Too easy for me to get bogged down .
Hit like Glory Girl , hold nothing back as the Wretch , judge like the Warrior Monk , problem solve as the Scholar , and do n’t lose sight of who you fucking are , because that ’s a metric shitton to keep track of , Victoria Dallon .
Rain had given me a direction .
I was being so unfair .   
Monstrous , even .   
I could remember times when I had been scared , even terrified .   
Gold Morning .   
Day after day in the hospital .   
After Crawler .   
The day Amy had triggered , when I ’d been the one hurt .
I did n’t have a chance to finish the line of thought .   
I found Coalbelcher .
The head of the guy ’s side of the prison had his soldiers with him , and they were gathering at the flanks , near the side of the entry building .   
Some staff would still be inside , probably behind the shutters , protected by thick walls .
Up until Seir came back , razing the place to the ground so the bridges would be burned and Goddess’ army of prisoners would have no way to go but forward .
I could count them .   
Seventy or so parahumans .   
The prisoner coveralls designated the security level and the building they belonged to .
It took a moment of hovering before I saw Coalbelcher .   
His face - paint was striking enough to make him obvious even in the gloom .
I landed , and he did n’t flinch as I appeared in front of him .   
I saw him smirk .
“
You ’re out of your cell , but you ’re only partway out , ”
I told him .
“
I ’m just happy to be stretching my legs ,
” he said , in his godfather - high voice .   
“
You come to talk to me for a reason ?
”
“ To deal , ” I said .   
I indicated a direction .   
“
Not much time .   
Hear me out ?
”
We walked a few paces away .   
With the chaos and the max sec prisoners facing down Seir , there was enough volume that people would n’t be overhearing without sensitive ears .
Still , I ’d have to keep those ears in mind .   
I knew Lung was out there , and he was Goddess’ left hand man at the moment .
“
What ’s the deal ?
”
Coalbelcher asked .
“ I did you a favor .   
I need something .
”
“ Something is n’t free .
”
“ I did you a favor , ”
I said , my voice tense .
“
And that ’s only good manners for a newcomer to my block .   
I like you , girl .   
Do n’t make me change my mind .   
If you want something- ” The neon images the shaker had created before erupted skyward , a giant of flesh with a sea of snakes at his waist formed from dirt outlined in neon .   
Endbringer - sized .
“ -You got ta give something .   
I ’m being pretty generous as is , hearing you out , and in my assuming it ’s not coincidence that other people got the Wardens and the bombs all stopped blinking .
”
“
My teammate .   
Our collective effort .
”
“
Great .   
I still want something .   
Convince me , ” he smiled at me as he said it , meeting my irritation with sickly , black - spittle - between - the - teeth kindness .
“
There ’s a civilian with the Wardens .   
A pretty guy with a forehead curl here-
”
I gestured to indicate , “ -was with them the last I saw .   
He led a group of late - teens , early - twenties guys .
”
“ Flense .
”
“ Fucking great , that ’s not ominous at all .   
Flense , then .   
Her name is Natalie , she has a lot of inside information and connections .   
I need you to do for her what I did for you , in my roundabout way .
”
“
And ? ”
“
And … you did n’t murder anyone , did you ?
”
“ I had an unpaid ticket , ” he said , sarcastic .
“
I was going to offer you an exit- ”
“
We ’re all getting an exit , girl .   
There ’s no more prison , see ?
”
“ With a bit more leeway and a helping hand in staying clear of Teacher ’s control .   
Because that’s- that ’s being brain dead and building ray guns or something for twenty hours a day , until he decides he needs your power .
”
“ You ’re going to help me get free and clear , girl ?
”
“ I was .   
But not if you ’re a murderer .   
Not if you ’re a rapist .
”
“
I would n’t be a boss if I was .   
I had a rival .   
They decided I did n’t get my second chance , came after me hard .   
I came after them harder .   
They played it up in court , said I went- ”
A squealing interrupted him .   
The giant with a dress of worms was tearing chicken wire fence out of the ground .   
Metal scraped against metal .
“
They said I went too hard , ” he said .   
“ Broke the guy ’s jaw , which is true , it needed to be wired shut .   
I hurt his back , lifetime of pain , bullshit .   
I did n’t touch his back .   
His arm ?   
No .   
Lung damage ?   
Nah .
” I did n’t really have any time to spare .   
I knew he was probably playing it down .   
But if it was n’t murder , was I really okay excusing that kind of violence ?
It was n’t lawful , right , or good to be the person who decided he got away for this crime .   
But if I did n’t do anything , everyone would get away , or everyone would be under Teacher ’s control , which was worse than prison .   
It was having the mind shackled .
“ I ’ll check up on things after , ” I said .   
“
If you ’re lying , I come after you .
”
“ I look after this Natalie as long as you look after me , ” he said .   
“
She knows how to get in touch with you ?
”
“
Yeah .   
When the phones are back online .
”
A monstrous thing to do , I thought , a continuation of my thought from earlier .
I could remember how scared I ’d once been .   
When things had been worse than I ’d ever experienced , when I ’d been alone , more or less , or powerless .
Natalie was in that boat .   
I was going to lengths to give her the chance to do something , because she was one of only three people I could count on , with the protocols .
Monstrous , to put that on her shoulders , to demand something of her .   
But she was a teammate and the only other people we could lean on were a guy who did n’t know the protocols ,
talented as he was , and a girl who talked to mice .
Monstrous .
“
Cryptid ’s at the gate , ” Lookout said , as I caught up with the group .   
The boys were already in the tunnel .
“ At the gate ?   
Near Teacher ’s group ?
” Lookout nodded .   
“
Um .   
He brought company .
”
“
My sister , ” I said , my voice tight .








The tunnel was a concrete tube , stabbing in the direction of the front gate of the prison , bright lights arranged on the sides at roughly eye level , each pair of lights spaced out from the ones before and the ones to come , all contained within protective cages , many of which illuminated the spiderwebs that covered them and the moths that had found their way down .   
The matching pairs of lights made Rain and Byron cast two half - intact shadows , where they stood a little ways down the tunnel .   
In the ring of lights that surrounded the short ladder down , I cast a half - dozen .   
That half - dozen shadows narrowed to two as I approached the boys .
A heavy impact elsewhere in the prison complex shook the ground , and the concrete walls absorbed it .   
The effect was muted , diffused through the tunnel .
Lookout followed me down , hopping down from the short ladder with a ‘ hup’ sound .   
She was small in the shadows of Monokeros and Damsel , who were right behind her .
“
I hope you ’re not claustrophobic , ” Rain murmured .
I glanced at the walls of the tunnel .   
It was narrow enough that the lights on the left side were only six feet or so from one another .   
Because it was a tube , the path was only two feet wide or so , before it became a curved slope that could n’t really be walked on .
No room to fly or to maneuver if it became a fight .   
No real ability to throw ourselves to the side if there was trouble .   
Dropping to a position where we were flat against the floor meant we ’d be lying in a row , because the sloped floor would just see us rolling down toward the path at the center .   
No cover to be had .
If anything , the open space extending both front and back was more … concerning than the unyielding concrete and dense earth to either side , above , and below us .
There was another impact .   
Bugs fled cracks in the walls , tracing crazy paths in their search for hiding places that were n’t anywhere to be found .
“
How are we doing this ?
” Byron asked .
“
I have some experience in leadership , if you guys need some direction , ” Damsel said , from the back .
“ I- ” I started , pausing to double - check myself .   
“
I know the team better .   
I ’ll give some direction , if that ’s okay ?   
I have ideas .
”
I saw her shrug .   
Her gaze was cool , but her mannerisms nervous as she shifted her weight to her other foot , claw hands twitching .
“ Byron , ” I said , even as my thoughts were trying to judge that nervousness in Damsel .   
“
If it ’s okay , we could use Tristan right about now .
”
“
Sure .   
Why ?
” Byron asked .
“
He can give us cover , and I know Blindside carries a gun .
” Byron nodded .   
He blurred .
“ I could lead if you wanted , ” Tristan said .   
“
I led Reach for a while .
”
“ If it ’s okay … given what we talked about just outside the headquarters , I ’ll take point .
”
“
Because I said I did n’t trust myself .
”
“
Sure , ” I said .   
I had n’t wanted to just volunteer that , with so many listening in .
“
Do you trust yourself ?
” he asked .
I hesitated .   
Then I shook my head .   
“ I do n’t know .
”
“
Ahem , ” Damsel cleared her throat .   
She raised a hand , the claw - tips scraping the concrete wall .   
“
I trust myself .
”
“ Uh , ” I said .   
As Glory Girl and as a member of the Patrol , I ’d occasionally run into situations like this , when dealing with people who were wholly unreasonable or hampered in their reasoning .   
They never got any easier to deal with .   
“ …
I ’m
mostly trying to aim for a happy middle ground between self - trust , being durable enough to be close to the front where we can see what ’s going on , and knowing the members of the team .   
Even if we accept you ’re confident , you ca n’t take a bullet .
”
“
Mmm .   
I suppose .
”
“ Tristan , can you make us shields ?   
One for each of us ?   
More like the shields SWAT teams and Patrol teams have than anything else .
”
“ It ’ll be heavy .
”
“ Worst case scenario , it breaks in my hands .
”
“
Sure .
”
I nodded , thinking .   
“
Damsel- is it okay if I call you that ?
”
“
Mm hmm .
”
“
If there ’s trouble , can we count on you to give us a side area to duck into ?   
If you put a hole in the wall , will it be okay ?   
Do you know if it ’ll make it more likely to cave in , doing what it does , swirling things around , or will it be less likely ?
”
“
No idea .   
We do n’t lose much by trying , ” Damsel said .   
“
Dirtying my prison - issue shoes ?
”
“ Except a possible cave - in of the whole tunnel , ” Rain said .
“ Give me some credit , ” Damsel said , her nose rising a fraction .   
“ If the whole tunnel collapses , it ’ll be because I wanted it to .
”
“
Great , ” Rain said .
“ And Lookout
, ” I said .   
“
Any camera feeds down here ?   
Drones you can deploy ?   
The more we know about what ’s going
on-
”
She was already shaking her head .
“
No cameras down here .
”
Lookout shook her head again .   
“ Connecting down - here to everything would defeat the purpose .   
It ’s a closed , secondary situation and a secret escape route for prison staff in case of emergencies .
”
“
Not a very good secret , ” I observed .
“
No .   
Um !   
Um , I do n’t have any ongoing camera footage down here , but I can find the old footage from when they headed this way .   
Some of it ’s dead and it might not have any fancy extra perks like thermal vision , seeing backward in time or physical representations of social relationships- ”
“
You can get your cameras to track social relationships ?
”
Rain asked .
“
She said she can take pictures of the past and you ’re focusing on that ?
”
Monokeros asked , dry .
“
Uh , yeah , ” Rain said .   
The rest of us nodded .
Monokeros seemed deeply bothered by that .   
If there was a question to be asked or something to be made of it , it was drowned out by Lookout talking , her voice insistent .
“
I ’m saying stuff like that .   
When it ’s cameras I make a lot of the time I can get them to pick up other noise and waves and junk , and later if I want to toy with the feed or go enhance , enhance , enhance , then maybe I can .
”
“
Okay , ” I said , interrupting before Lookout could get carried away .   
“ Footage of these guys , as they make the approach .   
Maybe they brought something .
”
“
Oh , right , on it !
”
“ Victoria , ” Tristan said .
I turned to look , and the orange motes he was drawing manifested into a shape .   
It was a little more triangular than rectangular , the point scraping the ground , but it had a bar across the middle and it had a hole in the front to peer through , if I kept my head at the right angle .   
Black stone , run through with veins of what looked like copper , gold , or a mix therein .   
It tipped toward me , and I caught it with my burned hand and my shoulder , before catching it with my other hand .
“ Stand back , ” I said .   
I glanced back to make sure the coast was clear , and then I activated the Wretch .
Stone creaked and strained as the Wretch grabbed it , and it bucked this way and that as hands gripping the top and then the side pulled at the edges .   
Part of the bar broke almost immediately .
Tristan did something cruder with his shield , drawing it small .   
He drew out more motes near where I was , and as I advanced , he advanced into the motes , putting his shield out so the stone would manifest and bond to it .
Once I knew he was doing that , I picked up the pace .
“ Rain , ” I said the word instead of calling it out , because the acoustics of the tunnel meant that sound would travel .   
“ If Tristan and I go down , use your ranged power to stall and distract , do n’t hurt anyone , get Lookout and Damsel clear .
”
“ Yep , ” he said , like it had n’t even needed to be said , did n’t even warrant a full ‘ yes’ .
“ And me ?
” Monokeros asked .
“ Your orders are the same ones Goddess gave you .   
Keep an eye on Lookout .   
Make sure she gets out safe and sound .
”
“ I meant he should rescue me too .
”
She did n’t even get it , did she ?   
That she was that ignorant , that fucking unable to see the wrong in what she did , that she might even say she ’d do it all over again .   
A complete and utter monster , behind me , her footsteps running .   
She could use her power on me at any moment- “ He could , ” Tristan said , behind me .   
He was the only one besides me who was n’t a little winded by the running .   
Rain seemed to be doing okay too .
Hearing that voice , the firm shutdown of the monster , it helped .
Too easy to get pulled- sucked down a rabbit hole .
“
Guys , ” Lookout said .   
“ My mask is fritzing out .
”
“ Your mask ? ”
Damsel asked .
“ I ’m all wired up .   
I ’ve got cameras for eyes , and they are n’t working , ”
Lookout said .
I floated in the middle of the tunnel , doing my best to orient myself in the air in such a way that if the Wretch started pulling the shield around to my left , I could rotate it back the right way .   
I looked back and saw Lookout scrabbling at her mask , pulling the reflective insert that ran down the middle of her face back .   
Her eyes , nose , and mouth were visible .
“
Any special vision modes ?
” I asked .
“
Not really .   
Picking up some of the visual noise as a supplementary thing .   
It ’s wired so I can plug other stuff in or see through a video feed like I ’m there .
”
“
But you could parse it if you took that recording back to your workshop and scanned it , ” I said .   
A statement , not a question .
“ Uh huh , ” she said .
“ Blindside , ” I said .   
Far enough down the corridor that we could n’t see them yet .
Lookout held up her camera , her expression serious .   
I did n’t have long to see before she lowered it for Tristan , then turned around to show the others .
It had been a video loop .   
Most of the cameras that were able to move had turned away .   
The ones that could n’t , I presumed , had gone black .   
The images we had were of people at the very edge of the camera .
“
What ’s the takeaway ?
” I asked .
“
Two people at the edge of the camera .   
Kingdom Come and someone else .   
A guy prisoner .
”
Teacher had someone on the inside .
“
No footage of the guy ?
”
“
No .   
He was walking right behind Blindside , and whatever mussed up the cameras meant he was n’t very visible either .   
He ’s skinny .
”
The Wretch jerked the shield to one side .   
I flew around , my arm extending to its full length , my fingers gripping the view - hole in the shield .   
Not wanting to fight it any further , I shifted position , ready to move on .   
“
We push on .   
Save Sveta , get Ashley , get Natalie , make sure we have control over the bombs if we need it .
”
“
Go for it .   
I ’m right behind you , ” Tristan said .
“ If you have to fight Blindside , swing something that wo n’t stop when your arm does .   
A flail , whatever .   
Or strike from an oblique angle .   
Switching elements might really work here .
”
“
Maybe .   
They could also risk drowning us or washing us away , ” Tristan said .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
The Wretch crushed a part of the shield , and I winced .   
“
Yeah .
” I flew forward .
Blindside , Kingdom Come , and one unknown .   
Somewhere down this tunnel was a computer , console , or other network that allowed for communication with the other Earth .
The shield blocked my view , but that did n’t change that Blindside still blocked aim .   
I was flying on a course , and I could n’t pitch that course to go cleanly over Blindside .   
I hit an invisible wall , my flight course altering against my will .   
I brought my legs up , feet planting on the wall , and then flew , strongarming my shield in Blindside
’s general direction .
I hit the invisible wall and canceled out the Wretch .   
The shield carried on , slamming into the concrete wall and scraping a light clean away from its housing .
“
Oh , it ’s you , ” Blindside said .   
They did n’t sound like they were so close they ’d almost been hit by the shield .   
Had they scooted back ?
Blindside moved , feet tapping against the tunnel floor , and I was forced to look away , turning toward the wall .   
I could gauge from the edges of my vision and judge distance using the angle
I ’d been moved at .
“
Reminder : if your head turns too fast the wrong way , you might snap your neck .   
That ’s not me trying to do it .   
I do n’t want to do it .   
Believe me , it ’s a problem , driver flies by , head turns too far to the left , car goes flying … if you go flying , actually flying , the same thing happens .   
I do n’t want the blame for that shit .
”
“ What are you doing , Blindside ?   
You work for Tattletale and Lord of Loss , got a heroine shot , and now you ’re here , working for Teacher ?   
I ca n’t picture those two working together .   
You ca n’t possibly think Teacher ’s going to fix your problems and not enslave you .
”
“
Get this through your skull , Patrol girl .   
I do n’t work for them .   
I do n’t like either of them .   
I work for money .   
Cash .   
Dollars and dineros .   
Trading dollars and New Dollars , if you want to be modern .   
I ’ll even take some nice horses for barter if I got ta .   
They tell me to guard the tunnel while they do what they do , I ’ll do it .
”
“ Take it from someone who was a crime boss in an earlier life , ” Damsel said .   
“
Sometimes it ’s easier to leave the help behind than to fork over the cash to pay ’em .   
You ’re going to get left behind .
”
“
You were n’t that kind of person , right ?
”
Lookout asked .
“
I never did it , no .   
But power makes people callous .   
I might have .
”
Blindside cut in .   
“
You ’re talking about Teacher ?   
That man does n’t want to be on my bad side .   
Half of what he does is make thinkers .   
The other half is making tinkers , some of which are still pretty darn affected by my power .
”
“
Power makes people stupid too , ” Damsel observed .   
“
We have exceptions , like Goddess and yours truly , but … ” “
Someone like Teacher ?
”
I finished the thought .
“
He seems like the kind of person who ’s so smart they do stupid things , ” Damsel said .
“ Maybe , ” Blindside said .   
“
But he ’s at least smart enough to know that if he crosses me he ’s going to have to watch his back .   
You know why he ’s going to have to watch his back ?   
Because I ’ll be there , walking up to his front , grabbing his dick and balls , and cutting ’em off .
”
“ Ew , ” Lookout said .   
“
Why do that ?   
That sounds gross and awkward to actually do .   
You ’d have to get his pants off .   
Stab him in the chest if you have to do something .
”
“ Or be creative , ” Damsel said .
“ Or be creative ,
yeah !
”
“ Or
do n’t cut and stab people , ” I said .
“
The whole merry gang , ” Blindside said , pacing while talking .   
“
Should I be happy you ’re distracting me from the boredom or annoyed ?
”
“
Annoyed , ” Tristan said .   
“ Come on .   
You ’re outnumbered , we just fought Lung , plus the Pharmacist , the woman who sets powers on fire .   
We won .
”
“
Yeah , ” Blindside said .   
“
Here ’s the reality .   
I ’ve had my power for a while .   
I know a lot of the tricks .   
I ’m armed and all of you ca n’t hide behind one shield .   
You could win .   
But you might not .   
Turn around , leave , I wo n’t stop you .   
When we get what we want and we leave , we ’ll bring your guys with .   
Happiest outcome .
”
“ I ca n’t lock on , ” Monokeros said , from the very back of the group .   
“ You guys are on your own .
”
I saw orange motes start to appear in the corner of my eye .   
My head flicked around as Blindside ran beneath me , toward the group .
“
Incoming !
”
I called out .
I heard Tristan ’s , “ Fuck !
”
Blindside had slipped past the wall Tristan had been making before it had been confirmed .   
He dismissed the motes , audibly grunting as something crackled .
Voices overlapped .   
“ That itty bitty thing is n’t going to-
”
“
That ’s a tas-
”
From what I could gather , Blindside had realized their stun gun did n’t work on Capricorn and applied it to Rain instead .
Poor Rain .
Damsel ’s power crackled , then flared out , the noise deafening in the close confines of the tunnel .   
Blindside shrank against one side of the tunnel , which meant I could turn my head to see three - quarters of the scene .   
Damsel had backed off a bit , and now held her claws out .   
The distortion of her warped space was being held within the confines of her claws , a roughly spherical shape of what looked like slices of space seen through very tinted glass , Vista
’s warped space , slices and curls of total blackness , and crackles of black lightning .
I heard a gun cock .
“ Shoot me , and this stuff
I ’m
holding fills the tunnel , ” Damsel intoned the words .
“ And your team ?
” Blindside asked .
“
They ’re not mine .   
They ’re a means to an end .   
Meanwhile , you ’re an obstacle , which means you ’re going to end , ” Damsel said .   
She could n’t look straight at Blindside , so she turned her chin up , arms out , holding the contained storm of shadows and blurs .
“ If you think I wo n’t put a bullet in any of
them- ” “ I do n’t care .
”
“ You do n’t care ?   
Haha , what ?
”
Lookout asked .   
“
You said I was cool !   
We bonded over a book !   
So much for you being cool !
”
The gun cocked again .   
“
I ’m aiming at the kid now .   
Do n’t think I wo n’t put bullets in her legs .   
I had to deal with the Tweens Between in New York , and that helps anyone get over the hurting kids thing .
”
“
What ?   
Am I in upside - down world , all of a sudden ?   
Damsel being hilariously uncool and people saying the T.B.T. are n’t the best ?
”
Lookout said .
“
Lookout , ” Capricorn said .   
“ You wanted to be on the front lines .   
You need to keep your head on the task at hand .   
Ca n’t get upset at Damsel and excited about some overrated hero group .
”
“ Okay , ” Lookout said .   
There was a pause , then she muttered , “ They were n’t overrated .
”
“ Put the power away .   
The noise is hurting my ears , ” Blindside said .   
“
I will shoot the kid if you do n’t .   
In four , three , two-
”
The power fizzled out .   
Damsel had to shake one claw to get one flicker of power to disappear , and in the midst of the shaking , her claw tip scratched concrete .
“ Turn around .   
Go the other direction , ” Blindside said .
At the front of the group , still holding his shield , Capricorn looked up at me , eye barely visible in the shadows behind the goat - styled helm .   
At one hand , his finger indicated the end of the hall .
Me ?   
Going on alone ?
I hesitated , glancing in that direction .   
I ’d be dealing with Kingdom Come and a strange cape alone .
“
Do n’t even think about it , ” Blindside said .   
“ If you leave , Patrol girl , I ’ll start shooting .
”
We could n’t fight them in close confines without hitting allies .   
Could n’t use something like Tristan or Damsel ’s power without affecting allies .
I did believe that they ’d shoot someone .
“
Alright , ” I said .
“
Two options , ” Blindside told us .   
“
You fuck off , or you stay until K.C. finishes what he ’s doing and comes back .   
Which might be a while , because he ’s taking his time .   
When K.C. turns up , you ’re going to run because you do n’t want him using his power on you .   
That ’s a fast ticket to Teacher getting his hands on you .
”
“
Which means we might as well just fuck off , ” I said .
“
Good girl , ” Blindside said .   
“
You finally get it .
”
“
Our team , ” Rain said .
“ They ’re in good hands .
”
“
Go , ” I told the group .   
“
Back the way we came .   
We head for the entrance , do what we can .
”
“
But Tress , and Swansong , ” Lookout said .
Capricorn looked up at me .   
Then he switched .   
Tristan to Byron .
Was he thinking or hoping that Byron had a clever idea ?   
If he was , he was inside Byron now , very disappointed that his brother did n’t have any more ideas than he did .   
Byron let the large shield drop , then headed back through the group , helping Rain and putting a hand on Lookout
’s shoulder .
“ I think dealing with Teacher is the kind of situation where nobody wins , ” I told Blindside , flying above so that the limits of my field of vision kept track of where they were .
“
That ’s my problem to deal with .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“ If you ’re thinking about having the guy in the fish armor flood the tunnel , think again .   
I would n’t be letting you go if I thought that was going to work .
”
I nodded , and then I flew after the others .   
My hand caught the ladder as I reached the wall , my arm catching some of my forward momentum .   
I grazed Monokeros on my way up past the ladder .
“
We ’re really abandoning them ?
” Tristan asked .   
He was already aboveground .
I looked down the hole .   
Monokeros glared up at me .
“
We ’re not going down through there , ” I said .   
“ Come on .   
We ’re heading to the front gate .
”
“ I do n’t like leaving them , ” Lookout said .
“ We wo n’t .   
Sveta ’s my best friend and Swansong
gave me an apartment with no strings attached .   
We wo n’t leave them , I promise you .
”
Lookout nodded .   
“
I want everyone together again .   
We get Tress and Swansong , and then we get Cryptid , and we ’ll have Damsel of Distress with us as a bonus .   
Um , sorry .   
I ’m getting distracted again .   
Usually Cryptid tells me to shut it .
”
Cryptid .   
It was a disorienting thought , because there was so little about Chris that let me orient my thoughts where he was concerned .   
He was out there with my sister- and that last element was something that I actively did n’t want to think about .   
Disorientation and aversion both .   
Revulsion .   
Hate .   
Disappointment .
“
Do you have an actual plan , or should someone else step up ?
” Damsel asked .
“ I have a fucking plan , Damsel , ” I said .   
“ Ease up .
”
Talking about leadership in the first place had been a mistake .   
I had to take a second , clearing my thoughts .   
There was a way to do this .
“
Lookout , ” I said .   
“
We saw the tunnel .   
We saw where it goes .   
I know
there ’s no footage there , but is there any way you can map it out and help us figure out where the tunnel is , beneath us ?
”
“ We ’re going in from above , ” Rain said .
“
What do you think ?
” I asked .
“ I think we could , ” Lookout said .   
“
Um .   
When I was lensing the space map , I was n’t even thinking of underground tunnels ,
so I double checked before and-
”
“
Speed it up , ” Byron said .
Lookout talked double - speed as she finished , “ I have a strong guess
and I can refine it .   
With what we saw down there .
”
“ Do it , ” I said .
“
Yes !   
Projector disc , Capricorn ? ”
He handed it over .
There was an outright war going on near the front door of the prison .   
I could hear the succession of noises , of distant detonation , pause , detonation , pause , rumble of something collapsing .   
The pauses were becoming fewer and shorter , and there were more noises that overlapped .   
Here and there , gunshots could be heard .
“ We get to the terminal for the bombs , and we end this , ” I said , keeping my voice low .   
“
We sound off an alert for every ankle bracelet , and they ’ll notice .   
Neither Goddess nor Teacher want to lose the prisoners .   
We can put an end to this fighting and make the prisoners stay put .
”
“
Some of the prisoners , ” Monokeros said .   
“
Some are leaving with Goddess .   
No negotiation .
”
“
Sure , ” I said .   
I met Monokeros’ cold eyes , and I felt my skin crawl .
“
I missed out on the Tweens Between , ” Monokeros said , wistfully .   
“
I liked them , from what little I saw of them .   
They had moxie .
”
“
Oh hey !   
Another fan !   
Moxie is a great way of-
”
Lookout said .   
She stopped working for a second , looking up .   
“
No , wait , hey .   
That ’s awful , haha !   
No ! ”
“ Work , ” Rain said , putting his hand on her shoulder .   
“
Tress and Swansong are counting on you .
”
“
Right .
”
She was a kid , in the end .   
She was , as much as any of us , trying to wrestle with conflicting feelings , with tension .
I wrestled with my own feelings , trying to anticipate what came next , without letting my thoughts get muddled by the blood - and - bodily - fluid streaked elephant that was occupying one large segment of my thoughts .
For a moment , it was all I could do to just keep my equilibrium , stay calm , and try not to think .
One hundred and ten percent .   
It ’s not about being the Warrior Monk .   
It ’s about being all of it , getting to where every part of me functions and functions well .
“
Got it , ”
Lookout said .   
She held up the disc , and lines sprung out , painting a fuzzy rectangle on dirt and grass .
Something struck with a sound like cymbals as large as a building , loud enough that every single one of us bent over , hands at or near our ears , wincing in pain .
“
That ’s Advance Guard , ” Kenzie said , barely audible as my ears rang .
The heroes at the portal .   
If they were coming in , that was because the people they were trying to stall had gotten through , and the heroes were following after .
If the heroes were following after …   
Then Goddess had yet another massive advantage .   
Teacher might be losing this , and if he thought he was losing while he had control of the ankle bombs …
“ Damsel , Rain , can you use your powers ?   
Get us through the ground .
”
“ I ’ll do what I can , ” Rain said .   
“
But I sever , I do n’t really dig .
”
“ Whatever you can do , ” I said .   
I looked over at Damsel .
“ Only because you were good to my sister , ” Damsel said .   
“
What ’s a little dirt on an outfit this hideous ?
”
“
I ’ll buy you something , ” I said .   
The noise of her power tearing into the earth seemed like it drowned out the end of my statement .   
I raised my voice a bit , “
I think I know someone who knows the kind of clothes you like !
”
I saw a smile on her face before she started swiping out , tearing into the ground and creating a ditch in a matter of a single blast .   
People backed away as she widened it into a hole .
She did have control .   
It was n’t just holding the blast as a localized storm of energy .
The power geek in me wanted to spend hours thinking about what that meant , drawing an analogy between Swansong and Damsel , and me and … something else .   
Was that something I could chase ?   
Something I should chase ?
“ Hold up !
”
Tristan called out .   
Byron had switched out when I had n’t been looking or focusing .   
“ Give me a second .   
I ’m going to shore this up .
”
Damsel was panting for breath , animated , seemingly excited to be alive in a way that I had n’t seen in Swansong or in Ashley .   
Sweat streaked the dirt on her face , and she was illuminated by the orange lights that spiraled around her .
Rain dropped to a crouching position , pulling Lookout down as people ran by .   
Women in red prison uniforms .
Pure luck that Damsel had n’t been making noise as they came by .   
I held out a hand , indicating for the others to wait .
For Breakthrough to be at its one hundred and ten percent , we needed to get Tress , Swansong , and Cryptid .   
We ’d help Crystalclear and Ratcatcher , we ’d get to the console or terminal , and we ’d get control of this situation .
I gave the go - ahead to start again , my eyes scanning the area for any prisoners running around .
“
Another ten feet , ” Lookout said , looking at the disc and the phone she was holding .
“
Get us close , ” Rain told Damsel .   
“
I ’ll get us through the last bit .   
Cleaner and quieter .
”
Orange lights swirled , reinforcing the walls of the hole that was being dug , while Damsel stood at the lowest portion .   
She swiped out with her power , with no staggering or apparent pain , glanced up at Lookout , got a motion to go again , and repeated the process .
“
Good , ” Lookout murmured , peering over the edge .   
“
One foot of dirt and one foot of concrete left .
”
Damsel put a claw against the wall of stone , claw - tips reaching for purchase and finding none .   
She lifted a foot so covered in mud that the footwear was impossible to see , placing it on a spike , and then used a blast of her power to ascend to the top of the hole .
More control there too .
Capricorn leaned forward , catching at one claw with a gauntlet before Damsel could tip backward and fall the way she ’d come .   
Damsel said something I could n’t hear , walking away from the edge so the way was clear .
Rain threw his scythes , drawing a square .   
I looked over at Tristan , who nodded .
“ You block Blindside .   
I cover the other end of the tunnel , ” I murmured .
“
We ’ve got this , ” he said .
I flew down , Wretch out , aiming for the center of the square .
It broke clean , concrete shattering only when it struck the floor .   
I followed it all the way to the ground , landing with one foot , both hands , and one knee pressing into the dirt atop the shattered pad of concrete .   
I had my orientation , which meant I was clear to go .   
I flew in the direction of Tress and Swansong , Tristan landing behind me the moment I was out of the way .
Into the underground bunker .   
Past a room with ten bunk beds , past a kitchen , and into the larger room .
Into the situation .
A man in a prisoner uniform sat in a modified computer chair , the chair ’s back to the wall .   
He had the kind of brow that meant a perpetually furrowed glare , a mullet , and a thick beard .   
There were computers in the corner , and he ’d opened the cases , strewing components around him .   
Many had been worked into the chair itself , turning it into something more like a throne .
He was their access to the console … just as Lookout was intended to be ours .   
Inconsequential .
Of far more consequence was Tress , who was partially out of her armor .   
Tendrils flailed around her , grabbing everything in reach , pushing some away , pulling others closer , flinging the rare one .
When the tendrils moved , it was with a speed the eye could barely follow .   
Something was whipped in our direction , and before I could see what it was , a crackle of electricity destroyed it , LEDs and boards across the tinker ’s chair lighting up .   
I saw the tension ease in the tinker ’s shoulders , only to return there as he saw me .
In another situation , I might have wondered if he was an opportunist who found their way down here .   
With the information from Lookout , I knew he was n’t .
“
Stop what you ’re doing , ”
I ordered him .
Sveta ’s head turned my way , by a rotation and flexibility that a normal neck did n’t have .   
Her face was streaked in blood , her eyes were wide , and she was lost in herself in a way that broke my heart to see .
That heartbreak stopped when I saw a grouping of tendrils move , but it was n’t a good stopping .   
It was sudden , numbing shock that stopped all other feelings , thoughts and processes .   
The grouping of tendrils all grasped the same thing- a lump of a shape in black fabric .   
Blood streaked the smooth ground where the fabric touched it .
“
What are you doing out of costume , Sveta ?
” I asked .   
I sounded so normal .
There was no response .
“
Where ’s Swansong ?
” I asked .   
Still normal .
She dropped her eyes to the ground .   
Tentacles flailed madly .
“ Crystalclear ?
” I asked .
More tentacles bunched around the fabric .
I stepped forward .   
I felt the buzz of ambient electricity in the air .   
I moved my hand and felt it intensify by multiple factors .   
Something told me that if I reached the threshold where this invisible electric fence divided the room , the electricity would converge on a single point , aiming to repel me .
Tristan , Lookout , Rain and the others caught up .   
They stopped a few paces behind me , looking over and under my shoulder at the scene .
“
Where ’s Ratcatcher ?
” I asked .
Tendrils twisted at the black fabric .   
Something crunched inside .
She flicked it at me , limb snapping out like a whip .   
I activated the Wretch by raw instinct , and the Wretch intersected the electric field .   
An invisible hand caught the cloth , and the nimbus of electricity briefly drew an outline around the Wretch .
Better at dealing with sustained onslaughts .
Something crashed behind me .   
I turned to look , still tense as the Wretch held out against electricity and held the black cloth .   
Rain had kicked the tinker ’s tech - upgraded chair .
Another kick , and the electricity went away .   
Rain and Capricorn both hauled the guy out of his chair , back and away .
I let the Wretch drop away .   
The fabric hit the ground , and immediately , tendrils began reaching for it .   
Unrecognizable bits of flesh rolled out .
“
You did that on purpose , ” I said .
She looked at me , and I saw nothing of Sveta in that face .
“ Kingdom Come , ” I said .
The black cloth- none of the others had been wearing black .   
They ’d been wearing prison uniforms .   
The cloth was Kingdom
Come
’s own costume .
“
He ’s controlling her ?
”
Lookout asked .
“
He ’s trying , ”
I said , my voice shaky with the relief .   
“
But the thing about Tress is that she ’s worked ridiculously hard to get to where she is .   
It takes a kind of strength , and that asshole does n’t have it .
”
Kingdom Come opened Sveta ’s mouth , worked her jaw .   
No words came out .
She does n’t have full lungs , Kingdom Come , I thought .   
For her first year or so , she could n’t talk or explain herself , not that she even knew the language .
“
Let my friend go .   
Reconstitute , end the breaker state , ” I told him .   
“ And
show me where Swansong , Ratcatcher , and Crystalclear are .
”
“
They ’re in the back , ” Lookout said .   
She brought her hand forward , holding the disc .   
The compass had lines extending out toward a door .   
We ’d have to get past Kingdom
Come to get there .
Going for the exit at the far side of the tunnel ?   
Is there one ?
Kingdom Come reached out with tendrils , groping at the ground and at piles of things .   
He worked to drag her prosthetic body across the floor , putting himself between us and
what looked like a large computer server with cables running into the ceiling above it .   
Loops of metal bound tendrils together , and more cables and loops bound the tendrils to the body .   
Only a portion were free .
“
Let her fucking go ,
” I said .   
I floated closer .   
A tendril slapped into the ground between us , slicing through the air with a sound like a sword might make .
“
Thane , ” a crackle of a voice could be heard , from the mess of technology to my left .   
“ Stop what you ’re doing , pull us out .   
Tell Kingdom Come and Blindside .
”
Kingdom Come crawled closer to the console , blocking it off .
Rain , scrambling to rummage through the tech , found the device .   
He pulled it free and hit a switch .   
He hesitated for a second.”Clarify .
”
“
Who ’s speaking ?
”
I mouthed the name .
“ Kingdom Come .
”
Tentacles slapped against the ground .
“ We give her nothing .   
Find your way back .
”
Kingdom Come dragged himself closer to the server .
What ’s he doing ?   
I floated closer , and tendrils struck out , forcing me to retreat .
How did this happen ?   
Sveta in the center of the room .
I could deal with her grabbing .   
I ’d dealt with it as the Wretch , but she ’d been careful to hold , not to strike out .   
It had been the product of years of work .
Orange motes began to circle her .   
I did n’t move a muscle , watching .   
Tendrils reached .   
Stone trapped them .   
I saw ‘ her’ react , pulling away , pulling tendrils out and through the gaps provided .   
Others squeezed at stone , straining to crush it .   
More tendrils reached , even using the stone as a point to grapple and pull herself forward .   
More stone trapped them .
Others reached out for the server .   
On the wall , there was a plexiglass case mounted , with wires hooked into the server .
It was n’t a fire alarm behind that case .
“ Shit , ” I said , realizing just how they intended to leave Goddess with nothing .   
I looked back at Damsel and Rain .   
I saw Rain look down at the bomb that was still at his ankle .   
The shackle that kept him in prison , currently quiet and black , but so easily it could become death or maiming .
Tendrils snaked in .   
I flew closer , and tendrils almost immediately shattered the Wretch .   
Orange lights danced around the tendrils at the case , but it was too late .   
The light solidified into a hunk of stone , encasing those tendrils , while more lights solidified into chunks of stone that kept Kingdom Come locked into position , unable to crawl away or mount an effective attack .
Still too late .   
Within that case on the wall , which contained an emergency button that might easily set off every single ankle bomb , I could hear the plexiglass shatter , crushed .
Beside me , Tristan took a deep breath .   
I met his eyes .
No time for words , no time for communicating a message , that message being received , the understanding .
Only the understanding .
Tristan became Byron .   
All of the rock he ’d placed throughout the room , on the server switches and on Sveta became a rush of water , swirling and flooding the underground space .   
Her prosthetic body was shoved , twisted around , and the tendrils pulled away from the button .








I tumbled through darkness , and this time there was no frame of reference , even a wrong one .   
The water was numbing , the darkness all - consuming , and the water around me was moving , more akin to being in an undertow in a fast - moving river than a pool .
Was that only foreshadowing for what was to come ?
The thought was eerily calm , disconnected from the danger and the chaos around me .
Fear was contagious , and the fear of the dark was something I ’d inherited .   
There was something about having a mom who often slept with the lights on that made a small child insist on her night - light .   
When a first sleepover fell to pieces because of the night - light issue , that little girl
’s
parents had provided explanations .   
They were superheroes , their powers used light .   
That was why .
It would be a few years before that little girl would start to feel she ’d been told a lie .   
Not a realization , but a feeling .
Fear paralyzed like cold water did .   
It shackled , limiting action , like debris stirred up by water , computer components and bits of metal hooking on clothing .
Two ways to deal .   
One could bend to it , succumb .   
It was n’t a bad option , despite what one might think .   
Because the alternative was to fight , to push through , and any movement that followed from shackles and paralysis was liable to be rushed , to get other people hurt .   
I ’d learned both of those things from my mother .   
I ’d seen her on her patrols , heading into dark alleys with only her weapon for lighting .   
I ’d seen her bend to the fear to the point
it was an integral part of how she lived .
If I acted now , if I used the Wretch in a confined space when I did n’t know where my team was , if I flew , I could do a horrendous degree of harm .   
I flew in one direction , found a flat surface , and pressed myself hard against it , until I was grounded enough to have a sense of gravity .   
The water roared , someone was trying to shout underwater , but the sound was lost , dulled and muffled beyond recognition .
Something touched my leg , then pressed out , pushed , and I felt the strength of it .   
Not a human hand or anything similar .   
A tendril .
No sooner did I recognize it than I felt it pull away .   
My leg was pulled after it by the force of the water moving in its violent wake .
Blue lights began to fill the space .   
Motes of light appeared , leaving trails and lines behind them .   
The illumination was murky , everything cast in one or two shades of blue and more pitch black .   
Objects were unrecognizable , the side and top of a table ten feet away looked much like a folder of papers floating within my arm
’s reach .   
Both moved violently –
I had n’t expected just how turbulent this water would be , or how much .
This time around , I had my orientation , but I did n’t have the ability to do anything with it .   
I exhaled slowly , letting bubbles slip through my lips , a way of measuring my time limit .
I searched through the oppressive , near - opaque gloom , a world of sluggish and violent movements , of chaos , and I saw nothing .
The movement of the water was n’t as intense as it had been in the first few seconds , but for every small amount that it slowed and calmed , I felt waves of stress and strain , my breath pushing against the inside of my chest , wanting out and wanting more .
Not hard edges .   
Look , Victoria !   
Look !   
Where are they ! ?   
Look for human shapes , for the lines of the human body !
Motion caught my attention , almost invisible in a swirl of computer chips and boards .   
I moved to intercept before I ’d fully verified who it was .   
Rain , swimming through the water .
I flew to him , grabbing him , helping him along .   
I saw his head turn , his eyes wide .
I could fly , and flying was better than swimming .   
Holding him , I flew us both toward the door , toward the tunnel where someone would have to swim further than the length of a swimming pool to get to the hole we ’d made .   
They would then have to get up through that hole .
Tristan drew outlines , and made dense material that fit within those outlines .   
Byron drew outlines , but the condensed material was something that uncondensed , expanding out to fill space , vastly disproportionate to the outlines made .
Rain slipped from my grip .   
He ’d stopped abruptly .   
I turned myself around .
He pointed .
Hair , floating free in the water , and a form that was n’t really trying to swim .
I nodded confirmation , and Rain kicked , propelling himself toward the door , the eddies and flows in the water flipping him belly - up .   
Leaving me to it , even as my pulse joined the dull roar of water in my ears , each beat a delivery of a swiftly dwindling oxygen reserve .
More blue lights surrounded Rain , surrounded us .   
It still felt like two shades of blue and black , but the blue was lighter , the black filling less space . 
 
I grabbed him and gave him a tug to help him on his way , and I saw a glimpse of Byron at the door .   
He was drawing out motes .   
Behind him , Damsel was already heading through the tunnel , visible more by the froth behind her , the water and debris turbulent .
Bubbles slipped through my lips .   
How long had it been ?   
Twenty seconds ?   
Forty ?   
A minute ?   
Two minutes ?
I was ready to get to a place I could breathe now , and I still had too much to do .   
I pushed urgency out of mind , with a growing feeling that if I did start to panic , I ’d be less able to handle it because I ’d put it off .
The hair , as I flew to intercept , was Monokeros’ .   
She was n’t really trying to swim .
I saw flashing , and for a moment , I thought it was the server somehow still alive .   
Then I saw the shape .   
The side of someone illuminated by the flash , a line with slight curves that could have been someone ’s leg or back .   
A human kind of shape .
I flew past Monokeros to the other shape .   
The flashing continued-
Lookout
’s flash gun , aimed at the wall .   
A signal .   
It was a steady series of flashes , until the gun ceased to work .   
I saw her smack the gun a few times .
She did n’t even realize I was there until I put my hands on her shoulders .   
Her head turned , and multiple round red eyes appeared in the dark , focusing on me , some narrowing like an old camera
’s shutter .   
She raised her hand in a small wave , and some of the lenses went dark .
Somewhere in the background , there was a detonation .   
I could feel it through the water , muted as any sound or vibration would be .   
It still shook my entire body .
I drew her close , pulling her tight to my side so we might be able to move faster through the water , with less drag .   
The return hug was bear - hug fierce , shocking after the casualness of the wave a moment ago .
I took flight , heading back the way I ’d come .   
I was a little less gentle with Monokeros , gripping her wrist in passing , wrenching it as I went .
Even approaching the tunnel was a complete change .   
The debris had flowed in this direction , and with the movement of water from a larger room to a narrower corridor , the churn was worse .   
It threatened to tear Monokeros from my grip .   
Byron was still there , waiting .
I did n’t get that far before tendrils gripped me .
Two living people in my arms .   
I could n’t use my forcefield or strength .
The tendrils pulled away .
It was always Tristan who had done the hand gestures or motions to accompany the uses of his power .   
This time , it was Byron moving his arm , touching a mote , and then moving his arm toward the hallway we were aiming to enter .
Ah .
More water , I thought , as the power took hold , motes disappearing .   
The lines and dots of blue light winked out of existence , plunging us into a darkness where the two still - lit lenses on Lookout ’s mask were dots against blackness , rather than anything illuminating .   
With that darkness came an impact , enough that it knocked the remaining gulp of air from my lungs .
It was cold , so fresh into our reality , and I had to fight the impulse to use the Wretch .
My focus was on the team .   
I controlled our pace by flying against the flow , tried to keep Lookout and Monokeros closer to the top of the tunnel .
I breached open air , and it was startling , because we were n’t anywhere close to the hole .   
Water was flowing out and away .
My hand hurt in ten different ways because of the burn and the fact that the water was soaking through the bandage and it was cold enough that it would have hurt on its own , much less making contact with a sensitive injury .
I saw the square hole we ’d cut in the top of the tunnel , and I hauled the two up .   
In the moment I was about to take us up and out , Monokeros jerked her arm free of mine .   
Waking up , maybe , or- who knew ?
Rain was still in the water , half - turned to absorb the flow .   
He was holding position and holding onto Byron , using his power to keep them both in place as rocks amid the overflow .
Tristan had walled off the tunnel , and up until just a short while ago , that wall had served as a dam , which was part of why the water had risen to the level it had .
Judging by the hole in the wall and the fact that the wall was n’t intact anymore- Damsel had blown it up .   
Helping , kind of .
I carried Lookout out , then flew down for the others .   
Byron was next , heavy as he was soaking wet and wearing armor .   
Rain was easier .
“
My tech , ” I could hear Lookout
’s lamentations .
“ I thought it was waterproof , ” Byron said .
“ Water resistant , a lot of it , ”
I heard her .
I flew back into the hole .   
“ Byron !   
Light ! ?
”
The light was meager , but it caught the edges and foaming rises of water as it flowed over the dam , past debris that had been dragged from the room to here .
There was a hole in the wall .   
My first destination .   
Damsel was within .   
She ’d blasted a hole that pointed back and away from the flow , forming an alcove she could stay within .   
Thane , Teacher ’s tinker from the server room , was lying in the rubble and dirt at her feet .
“
You okay to stay for a minute ?
” I asked .
“
You okay with making a lady wait , when she can blast your head- ” Damsel started .   
Her teeth chattered hard enough to interrupt her .   
“ -clean from your shoulders ?
”
My own teeth chattered , partly because of a sympathy reaction .   
“
Somewhere in there , there ’s another lady who can do that .   
I ’m
really hoping she ’s behind a closed door .   
I ’ve got to help her .
”
“ If you must , ” she said , before nodding in a way that did n’t match the words .   
“ Save her .
”
“ Huddle for warmth for now , ” I said .
She looked down at Thane and sneered .   
“
I ’d rather be cold .   
Huddling with me is a privilege .
”
“
Then see if Capricorn can make you a ladder .
” “ Will try !
”
I heard Capricorn .   
Tristan now .
“
Vic- Antares !
”
Lookout called to me .
I looked up .
She turned on a flashlight , then threw it down to me .   
A small one , bright .
“
You ’re awesome , ” I said .
“ Help my friends , ” was the response .   
“
I want us all together again .
”
I wasted no more time .   
I plunged into the dark .
Sveta , Crystalclear , Ashley , Ratcatcher .
Kingdom Come , if he did n’t come part and parcel with Sveta .
The water had vented out enough that I could fly over it .   
I flew into the room with the server , and found it nearly empty of water , now .   
Debris at the door was damming it , and I destroyed that debris using the Wretch .
“ Sveta ?   
Kingdom Come ?
” I asked .
Tendrils whipped out of the water .   
They seized me .   
I activated the Wretch , then dismissed it a moment later .
Calm , I thought , as my heart hammered .
She hauled herself up .   
She was too coordinated to be Kingdom Come .   
Most of her was outside of her shell though .   
In a way , she was n’t our Sveta .
Raising herself up to eye level , she brought her forehead forward , until it rested against mine .
“ Rinsed him off ?
”
I asked .
I felt the nod .   
“
He ’s over there in the corner , pulling himself together .
”
“
The B team is okay .   
Where ’s the A team ? ”
“
Downstairs .
”
Downstairs was n’t good .
“
He covered the ceiling so he was dripping down on top of us .   
I saw it at the last second , ” Sveta said .   
“
I took the bullet , and tried to put myself where I would at least get in their way .   
Thane had to work remotely .
”
“ You did good .
”
“
I do n’t feel good .
”
I wanted to reply to that , but I knew the feeling one hundred percent .
One hundred and ten percent .
“
Bricklayer ’s mantra , ”
I said .
I felt her nod , her forehead against mine .   
“ I ’ve got me .   
You go get Swansong and Crystal .
”
“ And Ratcatcher ?
”
I asked , turning around in the doorway I was already flying through .
She shook her head .   
“ Ran .   
Get the other two .
” I nodded .
The light from the flashlight was n’t quite sufficient for this kind of oppressive darkness .   
A single beam of light weighed against corridor after corridor , room after room of only darkness .   
I found the stairwell , and beyond the first flight , everything was obscured by the receding water , the level steadily decreasing .
I could hear something below .   
The terrible noise I ’d noted earlier , a roar or great grinding .
As good a cue as anything .
The debris and the degree of the churn at the top level of the water made entry by flight difficult , with an obstacle catching my shoulder on one entry and a lack of forward movement stalling the second .
Then I was beneath , and the already small beam of light from the flashlight halved in size , diffused into dark , grimy waters .   
My skin and clothing were soaked through and gripped with the cold water .
The roaring I ’d heard earlier was louder here .
Louder still as I flew deeper through the water , through a maze of things that threatened to catch at my armor and clothing , scraping at my arms .   
It was a morass of debris , old construction material left in the tunnel , where it could sit forever , and I could n’t use the Wretch because doing so threatened to make things harder to get through .   
I ’d only end up tearing things down and compacting stuff into barriers .   
I ’d run out of breath before I got through .
I exhaled a bit , letting bubbles rise to the surface .   
I ’d always found that trying to hold two full lungfuls of breath ended up being counter - intuitive .   
A steady release helped .
The current of the water became stronger as I got closer to the bottom , and the amount of sediment increased .
I found the source of the roar .   
Ashley , her back against the edge of a doorframe , stood knee deep in water .   
Her power was directed at the hallway , a steady , continuous blast , that bucked , kicked , and forced her to retain her control .
I thought of fighting the shield as the Wretch tugged at it .
I floated in water as it was churned by Ashley ’s power .   
Some of what her power did was annihilate , but it was random , and most of what she was doing was holding it at bay , steadily removing some of the water from existence .
I was still trying to figure out what to do to help when she stopped .   
The blast ceased , and water crashed into the room
she and Crystalclear occupied , the both of them just barely visible in the froth of bubbles and sediment before they were pushed back .
I flew into the room , and the force of water rushing in forced me to stick my feet out , hitting the wall opposite the door .   
I reached out , found Ashley ’s head , and from there , found her hand .   
One hand burned , holding Ashley despite the pain , feeling how cold her skin was , well beyond the norm of a human hand in cold water .
I did much the same with Crystalclear ’s head and hand .   
I could feel the chunks of quartz - like crystal studding each .   
I held his hand with the same that held the flashlight , awkward , the fierceness of our mutual grip driving the metal into the meat of my hand .
I led them through the dark waters , into the maze of wooden slats and fence material .
There was no roar anymore , no distant explosions as Damsel of Distress tore down a wall .   
Even high above , it seemed like the fighting had stopped .
Crystalclear helped to navigate .   
We found our way up , and when the coast was clear , I pulled them up at my maximum speed , hauling them to where we could all breathe again .
Dripping , panting , we all caught our breath .
I started to head forward , and Swansong reached out with one hand .   
It did n’t move well , and I could see her wince , before pressing her forearms against one another in an ‘ x’ .
“ Sveta , ” she whispered .   
“
She ’s compromised .   
Kingdom Come got her .
”
“
Sveta should be okay now , ” I said .   
“ Rinsed off .
”
“
Did you confirm with a password ?
” Crystalclear asked .
“
Sveta ’s one of the very few people in this world who I do n’t need to , ” I said .
“
There ’s a lot of people out there who probably thought the same thing and they regretted it later , ” he said .
I nodded .   
I would have explained , but I did n’t have the words .
“ Ratcatcher ran ?
” I asked .
“
She went up one of the ventilation ducts that is n’t supposed to hold a person , ” Crystalclear said .   
“
We thought she ’d get help .
”
“ We have n’t seen hide , hair , nose or tail of her , ” I said .   
“
Goddess won , we think .   
And we destroyed the server .
”
“
You destroyed it , ” Crystalclear said .   
“
You do realize that could have just set everything off ?
”
“ They were going to set it off , ” I said .   
“
Given a choice between a certainty and a possibility of making it , they chose the second option .   
I did n’t disagree .
”
“ They were really going to go that far ?
” Crystalclear asked .
I nodded .
“
Because Goddess won , ” Swansong said .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
I wanted to be happy about it , but I could n’t bring myself to .   
Too many close calls , too many questions .   
My sister was out there , and I could n’t avoid this … third confrontation .   
The third in one night .
One fucking long night .
“ I think the situation is as resolved as it ’s going to get , ” I said .   
“
Teacher loses , he ca n’t blow the bombs , Goddess has her army .   
The heroes are up there .   
I think-
if there ’s anything left to contribute to the situation , we help her keep the peace .
”
“
We help them , ” Crystalclear said .   
“
We help the heroes .   
This protocol , I ’m invoking it .
”
As if we had n’t fought enough uphill battles tonight .
But I nodded .
The others had caught their breath .   
Ashley was rubbing her forearms , moving her hands with a little bit more in the way of dexterity .
We entered the server room , and Sveta was there , a face and tendrils that were barely visible in the dark .   
She was hunched , for lack of a better word , over her ball .   
A case of bulletproof glass with staggered ventilation , so that a tendril could n’t worm through .   
A circular lock required some careful manipulation and a clamp of Sveta ’s teeth to properly open , if help was n’t provided from the outside .
But it collapsed into a flat position , and try as she might , she could n’t coordinate to un - collapse it .
“
Can I approach ?
”
“ You got them ?
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“ You should n’t approach .
”
I stopped where I was , floating .
“
I ca n’t coordinate well enough , ” she said .   
“ I practiced before , but never in the dark .
”
“
Give it here .
”
The hunk of interconnected slats of bulletproof glass struck my breastplate in what was essentially a ‘ soft’ pass from Sveta .   
The noise made my much - abused ears hurt .
I squeezed the orb , using my forearm instead of my right hand , and hard edges scraped against hard edges .   
It slid into its spherical shape , two pieces of plastic nipping off a bit of my arm as they came together .
I opened the lid , and Sveta reached inside , before pulling herself in .   
Tendrils had to be coiled together , piled atop one another , filling much of the space .   
With my hands full , I had only a glimpse of her expression .
Sveta ’s hell .
I locked her in .
“
Thank you , Tress , ” Ashley said .   
“
Doing that .   
I know we have n’t always been on the same page .
”
“
I ’m still glad you ’re okay .
”
“
It was noble , Tress , ” Ashley said .
“ It was stupid .   
For an instant , I forgot what I was .   
And I ca n’t do that , ” Sveta said .   
“
Other people ca n’t afford for me to forget .   
I positioned myself as best as I could , before he … seeped in .
”
I felt some violent motion within the sphere , as if a torrent of physical activity could illustrate the feeling .
With a very different tone of voice , Sveta said , “ I ’ll need my armor .
”
“
I ’ll get it , ” I said .   
I started to hand off the sphere , then stopped myself .   
“
If you ’re okay with-
”
“
Yes .
”
I let Swansong hold her .   
A silent Crystalclear pointed the way to the armor , and I knelt by it , moving the debris
that half - buried it .   
Most of that debris was paper .
“
Can you-
” Sveta said .
“
What ?
”
“
I ’m sorry
but can we leave the tentacles ?   
The ones Rain made ?   
Say they were too heavy to bring .   
His intentions are good , but … ” “
Got it , ” I said .   
I moved the flashlight to my mouth before figuring out how the new arms connected as part of the greater suit .
“ If it ’s a problem , you should tell him , ” Crystalclear said .
“ I will .   
But the last twenty - four hours have been utter insanity .   
We need to make sure people are safe .   
It ’s going to distract him .   
I know this is bad and it ’s against every rule in the superhero magazines and Saturday morning cartoon shows , but … ” “ Lie ?
”
Swansong asked .
“ Please .   
For now .
”
“
He worked hard on that , ” I said .
“ I know , but- ” Sveta said , her voice muffled .
“
Can we compromise ?   
Bring them , but have them detached ?
”
“
The material is good , even if the intent is overeager , ” Ashley said .
I heard a ‘ tuk’ sound .   
Sveta ’s forehead striking the lid of the sphere .
“ I should , should n’t I ?
”
“ Your body , your call , ” I said .
“
That ’s the issue at its heart , is n’t it ?
”
I heard her .   
With the muffling effect of the sphere and how quiet she was , it was hard to catch all the words .
A forearm of pale flesh , a loose length of dense black netting that connected it to another forearm of pale flesh , all in sequence .   
Some metal framework within provided a loose skeletal system with levers and pullies .   
The locking mechanism involved getting some concentric rings lined up and sliding a bolt through them .
I hefted it over one shoulder , holding it there in a fireman carry .   
with my free hand , I combed fingernails through wet hair .   
Wet costume , armor , and Sveta ’s body were all heavy .   
Crystalclear lifted the tentacles , wrapping them around his shoulders like a scarf .
We reached the hole .   
Tristan had made a ladder .   
The group was huddled .   
Thane and Monokeros stood off to one side .
We emerged , each of us in turn , with me steadying Ashley
so she could ascend with her hands both full and not at their peak .
Lookout sprung to her feet , and Monokeros reached out for her- missing
Lookout ’s shoulder .
She bounded to Ashley , and stopped short of giving Ashley a hug .   
Ashley adjusted her grip on Sveta , and pulled Lookout into a one - armed hug , arm at Lookout
’s head .
Interesting , to see how Damsel observed that , the fidgeting with claw - fingers , eye contact not leaving that scene .   
I was n’t sure if it was a terrifying interesting or a positive one .   
Figuring that out required resources I did n’t have .
In a similar vein , I saw Rain look at the tentacles Crystalclear carried .   
He did n’t remark at anything , instead turning to survey the situation , almost the opposite of what Damsel was doing .
The prison was quiet .   
Not a shout , no movement .   
Many buildings had been pulled down , the staff buildings in particular .
“
We lucked out with the bombs , it seems , ” Ashley said .
“
Not luck , ” Tristan said .   
He indicated Thane , who sat slumped against a wall , a short distance from Monokeros .
“
The situation in emergency controls went bad , ” Thane said .   
He talked like he had a mouthful of tobacco , all mush and sloppy syllables .   
“ I had to work remotely .   
Not nearly so fast as I would be .   
But I turned off the fucking bombs .
”
“
Even though Teacher would n’t want you to ?
”
Rain asked .
“ Of course even fucking though fucking teacher would n’t fucking want me to , ” Thane said , and he put enough clarity and emotion into each ‘ fucking’ that it did n’t make a mess of the sentence .   
“
I ’m wearing one of the damn things .
”
He shook his ankle to demonstrate .
“
He told Rain and Byron when we took him back to lash him to a light fixture , ” Tristan said .   
“
Not that this is the best outcome .
”
This .   
The bombs were ineffective now .   
The prisoners were free .   
United under an effective leader .
“
We need to save Cryptid , ” Sveta said , within the sphere .   
“ And Natalie .
”
“
Yes , ” Lookout said .   
“ Please .
”
I could look across the group and I could see the people who had very little fight left in them .   
Me .    
Ashley .   
Sveta .   
Rain had taken a bit of a beating , but that was usual .
By contrast , Lookout and Capricorn looked fairly eager to go .   
I knew that they had their own issues .   
That Tristan was on edge from earlier in the night , still battling some demon I did n’t know the name of .   
Lookout
’s demon was named Lookout , accompanied by a yin - yang extension of that struggle , currently in the form of Monokeros .
“
The worst of it ’s over .   
Let ’s focus our energies on those two , do what we can to minimize the damage , ” I said .
“ It ’s not over , ” Crystalclear said .   
“
Let me … assert my authority on that .
”
“ Is that your vision ?
”
Lookout asked .   
“
Is it something you see ?
”
That ’s not the authority he means , I thought .   
He means the master - stranger protocols .
I had to mentally reorient my perspective .   
This is n’t over ?   
It felt over .
“ … if my phone was n’t broken , I ’d really really like to get a reading of how your crystals work and how you see through them , and-
” Rain nudged Lookout
’s shoulder with one elbow .
“
-and
yeah ,
” she terminated early .
“
It ’s not something I see , ” Crystalclear said .   
“
It seems pretty obvious , but I do n’t know how to handle this .   
It ’s freaky to see .
”
“
It ’s not something you see , it ’s just that you see as freaky ?
”
Lookout prompted him .
“
Yes , ” he said .
“
That does n’t make sense , ” she said .
“
I ’m going to handwave it and say my crystal - vision breaks the rules when it comes to seeing stuff .
”
“
Oh , duh .
”
“
You ’re leader if you need to be , Crystalclear , ” I said .   
Then , for Monokeros’ benefit , to cloud the master - stranger protocols , I explained , “
You ’re with Foresight , they were first on the scene .   
I ’m
okay
following orders .   
You make the calls .   
If you say we should back off and make contact with our team another way … ” “ I ’m not going to say that , ” he said .   
“
That might be the way to go , I do n’t know .   
I ’m working with limited information , with a really distorted view of my own , and I hate that .   
What I do know is that the situation is unsalvageable like this .
”
“ Agreed , ” I said .
“ We need one sane person to report to people in the know .   
That means we get people out .   
”
“ If you ’re talking about going against Goddess , we might have a bit of a problem , ” Monokeros said , and her voice was low .
“
He is n’t , ” Tristan said .   
“
The situation ’s a mess .   
The prison is totaled , and some complete scumbags are now going to be free .   
We need to talk to the key people so they can rein those guys in .   
The guys who are n’t going with Goddess . ”
He sounded so natural saying it .   
Not one hint of a lie or falsehood .
All the same , there was a pause as Monokeros locked eyes with Tristan .
“ Woah ! ”
Crystalclear barked the word , loud enough to startle us .   
He threw himself between Tristan and Monokeros .   
“
What was that ?   
You used your power on him ?
” I tensed .   
Monokeros awed people , like my awe power turned up to maximum .   
She gained protections against that target , as well as insights into their personality and mind .   
It was that last thing she had used against Tristan .
“
I wanted to see if he was being genuine , ” she said .   
“
He ’s loyal but not genuine .   
I ’m not stupid , Capricorn .   
You know deep down inside that everyone is going with Goddess .
”
“ Shit , ” Crystalclear said .
“ Once the dust settles , she will come for you and any others who are n’t on her side .   
As soon as it ’s not pointing her to any immediate threats , her danger sense will tell her if there ’s any corner of the world where enemies lurk .   
She will find them and bring them in line , starting with the closest or the most severe .
”
I saw Crystalclear draw in a breath .   
Fingers ran along a crystal near his elbow , nervous .
“
Do what you need to do , tell us what you need , and I , at least , will trust you , ”
I told Crystalclear .
“
I wish I had a big plan .   
Maybe I ’ll come up with
one- ” “ You wo n’t , ” Monokeros said .   
She took a step forward , limping .   
She ’d hurt her leg earlier .
Crystalclear ignored her .   
“
But for now , I think my number one priority is making acquiring me as hard as possible .   
I ’ll see who I can round up , you do what you need to do with your team , and whoever gets to the authorities first tells them everything .
”
There are n’t even any good authorities to go to .   
The Wardens are in shambles , the major teams are either here or dealing with their own disasters .
“
It wo n’t work , ” Monokeros said .   
“ You wo n’t get away .
”
“
I ’m going to try , ” Crystalclear said .
“ Cryptid said we should decentralize , ” Sveta said .   
“
I think it makes sense .   
We ’ve got Ratcatcher out there , Cryptid ’s doing his thing .
”
“ When in doubt , when law and right and wrong do n’t factor in , reach out , ”
I murmured .
“
Yeah , ” Sveta said .   
“
Let ’s reach out .   
Let ’s get our guys and Crystalclear , you get your guys .   
Someone has to be able to find a good solution .
”
“
Goddess has , ” Monokeros said .
“
Please , ” Damsel said , from the periphery of our gathering , still sitting with her back to a ruined wall .   
“ Shut the fuck up .
”
Monokeros made a small giggling sound .   
My skin crawled .
“
It ’s fine , ” she said , sounding very cavalier .   
The whites of her eyes showed very distinctly as she lowered her face to an angle .   
It was a model
’s pose for a portrait shot , a little out of practice , the hinges and bolts a little too loose in how she held herself together .   
But still a model ’s look , meant for the dramatic effect .   
“
You should run far , far away , Crystalclear .   
And I ’m going to leave too .   
To report to my Empress .   
The rest of you should do what you want .   
It ’s done .   
I ’ll tell her you did good work .
”
“ Thank you for that , ” Ashley said , her voice laced with sarcasm .
“
Come , ” Monokeros said .   
“
Lookout , with me .
”
Lookout did n’t budge .
“
She gave you to me as a gift .   
It ’s a little bit like getting a book as a gift with the cover ripped in half , I have to grin and bear it- ”
The entire team tensed .   
I might have put out a bit of aura , but I could n’t be sure .
“
What the fuck ?
”
Rain asked .   
“
You did not just say that about our teammate and friend .
”
“
It ’s okay ,
” Lookout said , her voice light .   
She took a step forward , and Ashley reached out for her .   
Lookout shrugged free of Ashley ’s hand , spinning around .   
“
It ’s okay , really .   
Please do n’t grab me like that .   
It ’s okay if she does it because she ’s that kind of person , but I know you ’re better than that , Ashley .
”
Ashley let her hand fall to her side .
“ I ’ve got to do this , ” Lookout said .   
“
And I want you to trust me
that I ’m
okay doing this .
”
“ Okay , ” Ashley said .
“
Not okay !
”
Sveta raised her voice .
The rest of us voiced our own protests .
“
Come , ” Monokeros said , like she was talking to a dog .   
Lookout went to her with a bit of a skip to her step .
Tristan was quickest to close the distance .   
Monokeros stumbled a little as she turned around , putting a hand out to her side , indicating Lookout .
“
She ’s using her power , ” Crystalclear said .
Tristan stopped in his tracks .
“ I ’m using my power , ” Monokeros said .   
She lowered her gaze again , so the glower of her eyes was barely visible beneath finely plucked eyebrows , the ‘ horn’ of the triangle tattooed on her forehead pointed at Tristan .   
She moved her hand , revealing a shiv that she had been keeping in the sleeve .   
“ Lookout .
”
Lookout took the shiv .
“
You do n’t want to do this , ” Ashley said .   
“
I told you what would happen .
”
“ If they move a muscle to follow us , if they say a word , if they use a power , I want you to put that shiv in your neck as many times as you can before they make you stop .   
I ’ll be really , really proud of you if you do .
”
The group was frozen .
“
Really ?
”
“ If you can get it in there and give it a good twist , get it in there
so it goes in one hole you ’ve made and sticks out another , then cut out what ’s in between , I ’ll be extra proud .
”
“
It does n’t really work that way , though , ” Lookout said .   
Her voice was small .   
“
I do more than I ’m asked for homework and the teachers get annoyed .   
I work hard on my projects and my team gets upset because I ’m overworking myself .   
Every minute
I ’m
working hard , and it   is hard
, there ’s this feeling in the back of my head , like I can imagine the warm fuzzy feeling when they ’re amazed and happy .   
I ’ve made them happy .   
That ’s what pushes me to do it .   
But it never works out the way I hope , because I hope too much .
”
“ You want to impress me , do n’t you ?
”
Monokeros asked .
I found myself shaking my head slightly , as Lookout nodded .
“
You can feel me , big in your head and your heart .   
Hold onto that feeling , and believe , ” Monokeros said .
Tristan started forward .   
Ashley stopped him , grabbing him with both hands to haul him back , force him to land on his ass .
“
Close , ” Monokeros said .   
She said it to Lookout .   
“
He almost took a step forward .
”
Lookout nodded .
“ I want you to believe .   
If they step forward or give you any reason , and you do as I ’ve told , then this will be the time that matters .   
Believe that .
”
“ I believe you .
”
“
Yeah , ” Monokeros said , barely audible .   
“
This one last time .   
Unless they let you and me walk away .
”
The shiv fell from Lookout ’s fingers .
Monokeros twisted around , but Lookout was backing off too .   
She drew her flash gun , pointing it at Monokeros .
“
That-
”
Lookout fired the gun .   
A bright flash that seemed to illuminate the entire side of the prison complex the pistol was pointing at .
“
Wo n’t work , I ’m immune to my targets , ” Monokeros said .   
But she backed away a step , then lunged forward another step .   
Bending down for the shiv .
I was already flying .   
I was n’t alone in my charge .
Monokeros hit me with her power .   
It took all of the fight out of me , blinded me , and sent my thoughts spiraling into irrational tangents .   
Instinct and impulse recognized people hurling themselves toward her , and a bizarre , white - phosphorous bright impulse made me not want to share that space close to her with them .   
I turned .
Lookout fired again , and the feeling went away as quickly as it had come , just an instant before I could lash out at anyone nearby .
In the wake of it , I felt like a small part of me died , burned away .   
Not because of any lingering aspect of the power , but because I had n’t ever wanted to be influenced like this again .
Blinded , Monokeros kept a hand out toward us .   
I saw others react as she hit them in turn , firing blind .
But she could only affect one person at a time .
I put my hand around her throat .   
She hit me with her power , that white - phosphor , all - consuming feeling of being overwhelmed in a good way .
Again , the feeling of death as it passed .   
Swansong was there .   
Saying something .
“ …
if Antares lets go of you , I will take your head clean off .
”
“ Then do it , ” Monokeros said .
“
No , ” I said .   
“
No , we are n’t killers .
” I did n’t use my powers to force her to move .   
Shoulder to shoulder , my hand at Monokeros’ neck
, Swansong ’s hand gripping her by the ear , we made her walk backward .
She started to speak , and I squeezed until the words stopped trying to get out .   
She ’d talked enough .
Her feet reached the edge of the lip of the hole we ’d made .
“
I ’ve got it , ” Swansong said .
“ You ’re sure ?
”
She nodded .
“
Do n’t just push her
so she falls down to the hole and then falls through .   
That feels too barbaric .
”
“ I know , ” Swansong said .   
Swansong held onto Monokeros’ ear , as the rest of Breakthrough formed a loose circle around the hole .   
Swansong had to crouch , one hand and both feet sliding on the slope as she got closer to the hole itself .
She let go .   
Monokeros fell through .   
Capricorn ’s lights were already marking where he was closing off the tunnel .
If anything in this was salvageable , it had to be that we ’d either tell people to watch out for Monokeros in the access tunnel , or that we ’d just close the portal altogether , or leave it lensed .
Not a death sentence , but if we could put her in a world without people , without innocents , where there was only nature and subsisting on her own , I was okay with that .
“ … my first genuine friend that does n’t have my DNA , and you know that ’s a high bar when it comes to quality .
”
I turned to look at Swansong talking to Lookout .   
A small laugh from Lookout .
“ … and if you want to know for sure when people are proud of you , when people think you ’re amazing
then you should know that
this … ”
I turned away , turning a deaf ear to the scene .
It was for them , not for me .
Sveta was in Rain ’s hands .   
Tristan stood off to one side , keeping an eye on Thane .   
I turned my focus to Crystalclear .   
He was standing way off to the side , almost a hundred feet away , staring off into the distance .
“ Should n’t you be going ?
”
I asked him .   
“
You wanted to get away .
”
He shook his head .   
The crystals caught the meager light .
“
No
? ”
“ Over there , ” he said , pointing .   
“ That building ?
”
Three hundred feet away .   
The building had been hit by something that had caved in one wall , wiping out the floors that separated the first floor from the second , so it was just a husk .
“
What about it ?
” I asked .
“ I got that far , ” Crystalclear said .
“
And then … it was like something major had happened .   
A turning point in history , you know ?
”
“ I kind of know , ” I said .   
I had a whole mess of mixed feelings as I realized what he was saying .   
Trepidation was about fifty percent of that mess .
“
It came from you guys , but it bounced , because I get a feeling it started somewhere else .   
I can see it with my power .
”
“
She aligned you .
”
“
That ’s a good way of putting it , ” Crystalclear said .   
“
Oof .
”
“
Oof , ” I said .   
I gave him a light punch in the shoulder .   
“ Come on .   
Stick with us , then .   
I would n’t mind the backup .
”
We did n’t hurry as much , now .   
If there were moves to be made , then they would be leisurely or opportunistic ones .   
There was no use running , not when we were all tired , not when I was carrying a prosthetic body and Rain had a pair of prosthetic tentacle arms .
Besides , I really was n’t looking forward to seeing one inevitable individual in particular .
We made our way past the shattered entrance building of the prison .   
Past looted rooms and parahumans standing watch over scared staff .
I saw the assistant warden we ’d reached out to earlier and approached him .   
Parahumans moved to block my path .   
They seemed to recognize me and then backed off a little .
“ We ’ll do our best to help you out , ”
I told him .   
“
Do you need anything ?
”
The look in his eyes was haunted as he shook his head .   
An inmate at his own asylum , with the patients as the wardens .   
And maybe , just a little , there was a lifelong fear come to life .   
That the Parahumans were taking over and there was nothing he could do about it .
“
Keep your chin up , ” I said .
Out of the portal and into another world .   
An interim world .   
Here , people were camping or laying out tables and other things they ’d taken from the prison .   
There were a few improvised medical areas , and my heartbeat quickened on seeing them .   
I had to double and triple check to confirm .
No Amy , for one thing .   
That was ninety percent of it .
No friends , either .   
No Ratcatcher with grievous injuries .   
No Natalie .   
Not in the medical area , at least .
It was a short hike to get to the other portal .   
We were offered a ride by someone that had taken a guard
’s car , but we refused .   
The group needed to stay together .   
It was what Lookout wanted and needed right now .
The prison had been burned to the ground .   
The interim territory was a camp , a place to fall back to .
This-
this was a front line .   
All of the prisoners were gathered , organizing themselves .   
The heroes we ’d brought along had come around to working with Goddess .   
I could place them by the teams they belonged to .
Most of them .
I saw Goddess , and I saw that she was talking to heroes .   
They were n’t heroes that had accepted our invitation .
She ’d reached out , using her new power battery .
I saw Lookout wave , and I saw Natalie , gathered with prison staff .
I spotted Ratcatcher on my own .   
She was standing on the back of a pickup truck , ropes binding her hands to the spoiler .   
I got Crystalclear ’s attention , nudging him , and pointing .   
I saw him nod .
There were enough parahumans around us that we could n’t talk .   
The noise was too much .   
He tried anyway , saying something about how she was too big a pain in the ass .
No Natalie .   
No Ratcatcher .
Was it just the Wardens now , fractured and distracted ?
Just us , who had barely enough of a sense of protocols to doubt this reality ?   
We could say no to Monokeros , but were the others convincing themselves in the same way I was , thinking of how bad she was for Goddess ?
On that topic , of Goddess , I saw Cryptid in Goddess’ vicinity , talking to- to my sister .   
He wore a monstrous form , narrow but with a chest and spine so distended that it was almost like he was a dorsal fin or clown fish with four legs extending from the sides and planting on the ground , like stout arms mid push - up .   
His body was writ in mottled pink flesh , with a row of boils down the back .   
Only Cryptid could be that weird .   
If I ’d had any doubt about his identity , he wore the sash he usually did , to protect his modesty and carry his stuff .
What was unusual was that for the first time since I ’d known him , he was changing where people could see .   
From this to something else .   
I saw flesh sag and slough , and it was n’t this fin - shaped plague - disgust thing .
Goddess finished talking to the team she had just recruited .   
Arms folded , she surveyed her soldiers , and her soldiers , even the roughest of them , seemed to look up at her in turn .   
She turned her head and looked over to the horizon .   
Earth Gimel ’s Megalopolis glittered .
I watched with a heavy heart and a growing feeling of trepidation as Cryptid and Amy joined a small handful of others , forming something of a line .   
Amy at Goddess’ right hand .   
Cryptid a couple of spaces over , growing black feathers , his neck extending .   
He looked at us , and then he looked away .
Mute , yet capable of saying everything with a single look .
I looked back at Lookout , and I saw that she ’d been happy to confirm the others were okay , and now she was geeking out with Rain and another cape I did n’t recognize .   
They were pointing at the prosthetic suit of Sveta ’s
I still carried .
Only Sveta was really paying attention like I was , watching Amy and watching our teammate .   
She had been traumatized on a level by what had happened with the Irregulars .
That story was repeating itself , at least on one small front .   
Betrayal , inexplicable .








We had enemies here .   
We had put Monokeros in an extended time out , and there was nothing saying that any of our enemies here could decide to do the same thing to us , or worse .   
There were Fallen , tertiary members of Prancer
’s group , old Birdcage villains like Monokeros who could be a danger to anyone , and any number of ex - prisoners who might have unkind views when it came to heroes .
The rain was n’t as intense or driving as it had been before , but it was still a factor , still freezing most things .   
Prisoners were using forcefields to shield themselves , because they did n’t have jackets , and the prison uniforms , while warm , were n’t outdoor clothes .   
The ground was hard with frost and ice , except for where the passage of dozens of feet warmed it and turned it into mud .
I glanced at Goddess’ makeshift platform .   
The portal that led from Gimel to the interim world had been set on a hill with some lesser structures on it , the land leveled out .   
The platform was a large rock that had been cleaved in half , forming a flat sheet of rock with a crisp edge that would dull with a few more winters and rainy seasons .   
I could see the top half in pieces further down the slope , now serving as seats or perches for various capes in Goddess’ battle line .   
The rain traced a loose fractal pattern as it wicked off of Goddess’ bubble of telekinesis .
On that platform , beside Goddess , I spotted Amy , and I immediately looked away .   
On the train with Tristan and Ashley , weeks ago , I ’d seen Presley out of the corner of my eye and it had reminded me of Amy .   
That had been enough to fuck with my mood and my head .   
Now she was here for real , not for the first time tonight .
In the corner of my eye .
Keeping her in the back of my mind weighed on me .   
Keeping her out of mind
meant I was unpleasantly surprised when she came up .   
I could rationalize and reassure myself , and those reassurances about her character and the girl
I ’d grown up with fell to pieces when I thought about how she had repeatedly breached my boundaries .   
When she ’d used her power on me in the first place – if only that , I could have maybe forgiven .   
When she ’d used it on me a second time , following my explicit no , because I ’d been scared and I ’d been dissolving alive ?   
When she had repeatedly , constantly showed up despite my express wishes ?
There was a kind of fear where the heart raced .   
There was anticipatory fear where the heart pounded , a singular body - jarring thud at what felt like a slower rate , though it was n’t .
My chest felt as though everything had seized up , and I could n’t feel my own heartbeat in my own chest .
Enemies .   
Thinking about enemies was easier than thinking about … whatever Amy was .
Lung stood at the furthest end of the makeshift stage from Goddess , tattooed arms folded .  
Someone had picked up his mask for him , and he now wore it .   
The metal had dark mud still caked in some of the creases .
and from the angle of his head , he was watching me with eyes that still glowed .   
He did n’t look pleased with his immediate company , which included Seir , and he did n’t look pleased with me , either .
To wait , take a detour , get medical care , or go straight to Goddess ?
Straight to Goddess meant getting past the Fallen , and ‘ past the Fallen’ could never be a thing that occurred without incident .
Straight to Lung , angry as he was .
Straight to Goddess , who we would have to tell about Monokeros .
Straight to Cryptid , who would n’t look me in the eye .
Straight to Amy , who stood at the edge of that stage , lurking in the corner of my eye , not looking at me .   
Going out of her way not to look at me .   
That did n’t make it better .
Crystalclear ’s voice interrupted my thoughts .   
I ’d forgotten I was with the group .   
“
I ’m going to go see if they ’ll let me talk to Ratcatcher .   
I ’m supposed to be keeping an eye on her .
”
“ Or a crystal .   
Keeping a crystal on her , ” Lookout said .
Crystalclear smiled .   
“
Yeah , I guess .   
Can you keep an eye out for Fume Hood , Antares ?
”
“ I will , ” I said .   
I floated a little higher , so I could see over just a few more heads in the crowd .
Crystalclear jogged off , costume boots tromping in the mud and the puddles that had formed on frozen dirt .
“ I miss my gear already , ” Lookout said .   
“
I feel blind .   
I ca n’t believe I did n’t get any readings from him .
”
Blind was right .   
It was still dark , even with the light of powers and the lanterns and freestanding lights that had been brought over from the prison .   
The storm above did n’t make it any better , diffusing the glow of all of the electric lighting .
“
What ’s broken ?
”
Rain asked .
“ Everything ’s a little broken , or it ’s moist .   
Half of it wo n’t work at all , diagnostics and reboots are n’t helping , and the other half does n’t work   well anymore .   
Water between lenses , balances and tolerances are off ,   uuugh .   
My phone does n’t work , my flash gun is a fifty - fifty about if it ’s gon na work , and my other stuff is on the blink , cutting out .
”
“ I know the feeling .   
I miss my body , ” Sveta said .
“
Oh , gosh , sorry !   
Here I am complaining , and-
”
“
It ’s okay .   
It ’s fine , ” Sveta said .   
There was a smile on her face , and her voice was light .   
“
Complain all you want .
”
“
You ’ll fix it , ” Swansong said .   
“
You ’ll both be fine .
”
I turned to face the group and observe , glad to have my back to the stage .   
Freezing rain pattered on my hood .
Lookout shook her head .   
“
I ’ll fix some of it !   
Some .   
Some is broken forever .   
The broken - forever stuff is like my easier , cheaper work , like my mask , and less cheap stuff like my projector disc , but still , that ’s a lot of work , and I do n’t have my regular workshop anymore , so it ’s harder to find the time and get stuff done .
”
“ You might have a workshop where we end up , ” Rain said .   
“
We do n’t know where we ’re going from here .   
Maybe we all end up with a small country to run .
”
“
That caught your attention , huh ?
” I asked .
“ I- ” he started .   
“ I ’ve kind of always fantasized about having a place of my own .   
Even my fantasies do n’t ever get nearly that big , but it ’s easier to imagine because I ’ve imagined smaller scale versions of it .   
Give me a cabin or a quaint house with a good size backyard
and I ’ll be content .
”
“ Standards , Rain , ” Swansong said .   
“ Think mansion or tower .   
You need room for servants .
”
“ Uh , ” Rain said .
“
Cute young men in elegant black uniforms who run to obey when you snap your fingers , ” Damsel said .   
Two claws clacked together .
“ And young women , ” Swansong said .
Damsel arched an eyebrow , “ You think so ?   
Are you more worldly now , or is this a strategy ?   
Distracting male visitors ?
”
Swansong shook her head .   
“
We ’re talking about Rain .   
Rain would want women , I imagine .
”
“ You say imagine , but I can not imagine Rain in a manor with maids , ” Byron said .   
“
Sorry , Rain .
”
“
No .   
I ’m grateful you pay enough attention to know
I ’m not a maid guy , if anything .
”
“
It would be maids and a singular manservant .   
A Jeeves type , if you will , ” Swansong said .   
“
If you ’re to go that route-
”
“
I ’m really not going to .
”
“
-it ’s a good idea to have a same - sex servant who has the right sensibilities when it comes to your hygiene , fashion , and other needs .
”
“ I do n’t want any servants at all .   
I ’m saying my standards are perfectly good where they are .   
A house just big enough for me .   
A whole country is an interesting thought exercise , but if Goddess wanted me to run a country , I ’d still lean toward having a small house , and no servants .   
Servants rub me the wrong way , after some of what I saw growing up .
”
Swansong made a disappointed ‘ tsk’ sound .
“
Um , so , hm …
you would n’t want a Jeeves ,
that makes sense , ”
Lookout said , before her tone of voice changed to a maximum unsubtle , “ What about an- um , a you - know - who ?   
Would n’t you want room for at least one more person in your cabin ?   
Even as a maybe ? ”
“
You - know - who
and I have n’t talked enough lately , ” Rain said .   
He paused .   
“
You know , I do n’t think I ’ve ever really imagined myself having both a house and someone
I really care about as part of the same scene .   
Well , once , but … that was special circumstances , and it was n’t a happy sort of special .
”
“
Now I ’m curious .
” Byron said .
“ I ’ll tell you and Tristan later , I guess .   
Anyhow , I wonder if it ’s because it felt like even that was asking too much .
”
“
Set your standards as high as you can , ” Swansong said , while Damsel nodded beside her .   
“
Then live up to them .
”
“ If I set my expectations low , then me being in prison is tolerable .   
Things sucked before , and the only thing I wanted was out .   
I got what I wanted
and I ’m happy about that .   
I am- was actually genuinely reasonably okay with being here .
”
“
And now we ’re free , ” Swansong said .   
She looked around .   
“ Or something .
”
Something .
They were talking about future and dreams , and all I could think about was the uncertainty before us .
Either the Chris thing was all in my head , or they had n’t been looking at the right times to see it .
“ We need to get through this first , ” Sveta said .
Thank you , Sveta , for saying it .
She went on , “ Look at Goddess .   
She ’s tense .   
Teacher is n’t done , and we still have enemies out there .
”
“ We have enemies in here , ” I said , my voice quieter .   
“
And that ’s something we need to be careful of .
”
Rain looked over his shoulders .   
Lung ’s end of the stage was closest to us , and the Fallen were closest to Lung .   
They did n’t have much of a ‘ tribe’ , exactly- the other gangs that they ’d roped into their circle to defend against the good guys were too low - level to contribute much to the prison population .   
Dealers and bikers .   
It meant that they were mostly limited to a gathering of ex - Teacher followers .
“ I do n’t think they ’ll start anything .   
You ’ve got ta have balls and be stupid to pick a fight when the rest of the crowd could come after you , or if Goddess could get upset .   
Shitty as he is , I do n’t think Seir is that stupid and that brave .
”
The Fallen were n’t my only concern .   
I looked at Cryptid , who was still transforming .   
More feathers now .   
It was a form that looked pretty much exactly like his earlier shape .   
The twisted - up wingless bird with the hooked beak , and a neck that looked broken , head dangling .   
The point of the beak grazed skin where feathers were pushing through , more spearlike than featherlike as they were slick with moisture , and where the beak grazed , it left a line of oozing blood .
“
What ’s
Cryptid ’s form there ?
” I asked .
“
No idea , ” Sveta answered me .   
Others shook their heads .
“
He likes birds for the grieving - sad - pensive - thinking realm of things , ” Lookout said .
“
I ’ve never seen him change , ” Rain said , observing .   
“
And he ’s changed a few times today .   
Twice earlier in the day , before anything even happened , then to this bird form , he changed later towhatever
he was just a few minutes ago , with the ridge of cysts … and now back to this ?   
Did
he-
” Rain stopped mid - question , looking at me .
“
Did he get help from Amy ?
” I asked .   
The word sounded wrong in my mouth .   
“ Panacea ?   
I do n’t know .
”
“ He might hurt tomorrow , ” Byron said .
“ Maybe , ” I agreed .   
It might have sounded callous to say it out loud , but the pain he ’d suffer tomorrow was the least of my concerns .   
Every time I looked his way , I was trying to find some eye contact , some signal , anything that would suggest he was working with the group .   
I felt like I was seeing the opposite dynamic at play .
I saw him limp up behind Amy , the head swung like a pendulum , and he had to catch it with a talon - hand to keep it from hitting Amy .   
Amy said something to him .
My skin crawled .
“ Lookout , ” I said .
“
Yes ?
”
“ I know you hate being left behind , but- ”
“
No , ” she said .
“ It would make it easier to gloss over the Monokeros thing if you were with Natalie and not front - and - center in front of Goddess , ” I said .   
Not my only reason .
“
No , ” she said .   
“ I do n’t want to split up .
”
“ Even if staying with the group in the short term means Goddess might get worried again , assigning you another babysitter ?
”
“
Even if , ” Lookout said .
I found myself a bit at a loss for words .   
I could argue logic , but this was n’t borne of logic .
My issue was n’t borne of logic either .   
Half of the reason I wanted Lookout to hang back was because I did n’t like how Cryptid was acting .   
If he was in a bad place , if he was thinking about hurting himself to try and do something , or if he really was n’t part of Breakthrough anymore , then I did n’t want Lookout in the midst of it .
“
She should come , ” Sveta said .
“
It ’s best if we stay together , ” Lookout said , sounding solemn and sincere .   
“
But thank you for thinking about me .
”
“
Can I call in a favor ?
” I asked .   
I made a rectangle with my index fingers and thumbs .   
“ Or use the
it ’s complicated card ?   
Let me do this , let me explain later ?   
I have a gut feeling about this .
”
“ I have a heart feeling about this , ” Lookout said , stubborn .
It could n’t be easy .
“ Antares , ” Swansong said .   
“
She stood up to Monokeros .   
She ’s strong .
”
“ I know .   
I ’m not disputing that .
”
“
She stood up to Monokeros because she ’s worked really hard with dealing with obsessive and overwhelming feelings , ” Swansong said , her voice quiet .   
“
And because she really wants to stay with the group .   
She wants the group together .
”
I bit my tongue .
I looked over my shoulder at Chris .   
He still stood by Amy , growing taller and taller , the feathers filling in the space to the point that barely any skin showed , and the skin that did show had large goosebump - like growths on it that indicated the feathers pushing through .
Amy had her tattooed hands clasped in front of her , Dot on her shoulder .   
Amy ’s hood had been pulled up and to the side , used by Dot for warmth .   
Goddess’ power kept them protected from the rain .
The group being together or not together was the problem .
“ Stay close to Swansong and Damsel .   
Keep that emotional training in mind .   
This might be a tough situation .
”
“
Got it , ” Lookout said .
I nodded to myself .
Fuck .
I ran fingers through my hair to fix it , then adjusted my grip on Sveta ’s prosthetic body to ensure it sat squarely on my shoulder .
Of course the Fallen stepped into our way .
“ Rain - man , ”
Seir drawled the words .   
“
We were talking about you .   
I ’m hurt
you did n’t come say hi earlier .
”
“
Yeah , well , did n’t see the point , ” Rain said .
“ Respect is the point , Rain - man , ” Seir replied .   
“
We ’re not people you want as enemies .
”
“ I do n’t want the Fallen as friends either , ” Rain said .   
“ The respect thing is already decided .   
You do n’t deserve any .
”
The heavyset man smirked .
“ We have business with Goddess , ” I said , before Seir could answer .   
It was , in a passive way , my way of backing Rain up .   
More voices in the conversation made it hard to retort , to cut Rain down , and I was n’t sure Rain was the best guy when it came to wordplay and coming off as intimidating with words alone .
“
The lady says she does n’t want any hassle .   
If we let just anyone up there , then everyone ’s going to want to come by , say how they can be useful , try to elbow their way in .
”
“
It ’s important , ” I said ,
“ And it wo n’t take long .
”
It was Tristan who added his voice to mine .   
“ Refuse us access and you can be the one to explain why she did n’t get the information she needed .
”
When had they switched ?
“
The drowned rat in gold armor can fly , ca n’t she ?   
She goes alone .
”
Me ?   
I could , but- “ We ’re sticking together ,
Seir , ” I said .   
“
I do n’t think you were even assigned this job .   
You ’re trying to make yourself important , pretending to be a gatekeeper .
”
“ Do you really want to test me , little girl ?
” he asked .   
He locked eyes with me .   
“ Rain - man , you should tell these ignorant fools to think twice about what they ’re doing .
”
“ Why would I do that , Tim ?
”
“
Because , Rain , you ’d better believe we know where your slut friend lives .
”
Tristan put a hand at Rain ’s shoulder , as if to stop him from advancing .   
Rain was n’t quite the type to charge forward to swing a punch , though .
“
Some expert advice for ya .   
If you have one person you want to keep in line , Rain , then it does n’t work if you hit ’em , take a belt to ’em , stick their head in a water barrel .   
Takes forever .   
But if you get them as a pair , sisters , mother daughter , man and his wife , boy and the girl that will forever be too good for his useless self , it ’s easy .   
Tell the first one that if they do n’t listen you ’ll hit the second .   
Tell the second that if they do n’t listen , you ’ll hurt the first .   
Takes no time at all to break the both of them .
”
“ I think the fact that you have to do that makes you all look pretty fucking pathetic , Seir , ” Rain said .
“ You call me pathetic , I call you the same thing , ” Seir said , and his voice was a growl .   
“ Difference between us is that in a matter of hours , you ’re going to be on your knees , sniveling and begging for us to stop hurting the girl .   
Could be that you ’re there , could be that you ’re on the phone .   
I wo n’t even ask , and you ’ll still be begging to take back any insult you said about me .   
That ’s how that is .   
And the other way around ?   
There is nothing you can say or do that will change my mind about how shit you are .
”
His words were followed up by some shuffling movements and chuckles from the four or five Fallen and assorted others that were keeping him company .
Rain started forward .   
Tristan ’s hand was still at his shoulder , and it might have been what stopped him from doing something regrettable .   
Tristan became Byron , and Byron leaned in to say something to Rain .
“
Can I shoot him ?
”
Lookout asked .
“
No , ” I said .
“
Can I ? ”
Damsel asked .
I thought about it for a second .   
“
No
. ”
“
What ’s going on here , now ?
”
Another person joining the conversation , with a retinue at their backs .   
Coalbelcher .   
He ’d found clothes , and now wore a heavy jacket with a hood , zipped up all the way , a ball cap and jeans .   
I had no idea how he ’d found anything that fit him , but he ’d managed .   
A bit of black drool extended from the corner of his mouth to his chin .   
He was of a similar frame to Seir , but a little more put together , now .
“ Family , ” Seir said it like it was an epithet .   
“
A boy not respecting his betters .
”
I saw Coalbelcher ’s eyes .   
He was crude in dress , in speaking style , and in apparent intent , but there was calculation going on there , as he assessed the situation here .   
He had n’t earned his position as top man on the guy ’s side of the prison by pure luck .
“
Tell you what ,
Tim , ” Coalbelcher said .   
“
Let me talk to ’em .   
Consider it a stipulation .
”
“ Stipulation ?
” Rain asked .
“ We still do n’t know what ’s happening next , ” Coalbelcher said , “ But they need to shore up numbers , and then there ’s me and my people , all without a place to go .
”
“
You ’re joining them , ” I said .
“ Maybe .   
Depends .   
If our empress there is giving us each a territory of our own , does n’t make sense to .   
But if she ’s grouping us together , could be we join in .   
Work with .
”
“
Bad idea , ” Rain said .
“ We can hold our own , ” Coalbelcher said .   
“
But I wo n’t be lowest of the low .   
I go in as an equal , and I bring six powered boys from the prison and one powered son with me , in exchange .
”
“ You want to be a brother of the family so you can tell me to back off and let you talk to these pukes ? ”
Seir asked .   
“ Seems like a waste .
”
“
Sure , it ’s fine , ” Coalbelcher said .   
“
We have a pre - existing relationship .
” Seir shrugged .   
He gave one of his guys a push on the shoulder , and they walked off .   
They were still close enough to get in our way if they wanted , not necessarily in earshot .
“ You kind of disappointed me , Coal , ” I said .
“
Disappointed ?   
Must be we got our wires crossed .
”
His higher voice had a wry , mocking tone as a baseline , as if everything he said was sarcastic .   
It was hard to tell if he was serious about the wires getting crossed .
“
Maybe I was too subtle , ” I said .
“
You said you wanted me to do for her what you did for me .
”
“
And ?
” I asked .
“
And you got me out .   
Or close enough .   
Now I ’m really out ,
I ’m
bristling for a fight .   
It ’s all good .   
Wo n’t deny that .   
Did I misinterpret your intent ?
”
“
No .   
You read that right .   
Except she ’s still there , with the other civilians .   
You did n’t get her out .
”
“ Natalie ?
”
Lookout asked .   
She looked up at me , head craning back .
I nodded .
On the stage above , Goddess was walking toward us .   
Half of her attention was on the horizon .
“ I let her go .   
She got away for a bit .   
Then they caught her .   
I ca n’t keep letting her-
”
He stopped as Goddess came within earshot .   
All voices in the vicinity stopped outright or went quiet .   
Even the rain was silent , bouncing off of the telekinesis .
Amy stood at the other end of the stage , framed by Cryptid ’s black feathers , his rear legs to her left , one of his front legs planted on the ground to her right , head dangling so that his beak was near her elbow .
Could n’t get rid of her .
“ I ca n’t seem to be rid of you , ” Goddess said .
The weird alignment of thoughts threw me for a momentary mental loop .   
“
Sorry ?
”
“ This meeting , ” Goddess said , indicating Coalbelcher and the rest of us with an extended finger- Seir fucked off just enough that he was too far away to be included in the group .   
“
Two groups that concern me .   
Where the fuck is Monokeros ?
”
She was n’t just tense .   
She was pissed and tense .
“
She pulled a knife on Lookout .   
It was over the top and unwarranted , ”
I told her .   
“
We put her in time out .   
Two of Teacher ’s thralls are in there with her , Blindside and Kingdom Come .   
You should get them , carefully , and get Monokeros if you absolutely have to , but I really recommend keeping her there .
”
“ I will be retrieving her , but it ’ll have to wait , there are other concerns , ” Goddess said .   
“
My danger sense is emanating from your group , from you in particular .   
It ’s identifying Coalbelcher and his group in a similar way .   
Tell me why .
”
“ I do n’t know why , ” I told her .
“
We may just be those types of people , ” Sveta said , her voice slightly muffled .   
“ A little closer to being dangerous than average .
”
“ Gee , thanks , ” I said .
“ Is there anything we can do to help ?
”
Lookout asked Goddess .   
“
You know , if you give me a computer , I can gather information , or I can pull up records on people you have here , see if we can find the right tool in the toolbox for your particular problems .
”
“
You ’re among my problems , according to my danger sense , ”
Goddess said , her voice hard .   
“ Teacher has more coming .   
Not an army this time , but a trap .
”
“ Mama Mathers ?
”
Rain asked .
“
Yes .   
I wo n’t put my hand into that bear trap .   
We meet strength with subtlety and subtlety with strength .   
Coalbelcher ?   
I ’ll have you as part of the army that sweeps over that part of the city .   
Destroy everything , and destroy her with it .
”
“ I can do that .
”
“
Work with Seir and Knock Knock .   
Keep them in line .   
Do this
and I ’ll reward you .
”
“ I ’ll get everyone organized .
”
“ Be ready to move quickly .   
The Wardens may choose that time to attack .   
Once we know
she ’s gone , you ’ll fold back , and catch the Wardens by the rear .   
Immobilize , do n’t kill .
”
“
I ’m not much of a killer , ” Coalbelcher said .   
“
I ’m not much of an immobilizer either .
”
“ If you ca n’t do it , I ’ll ask someone else .
”
“ I can do it .   
Let me find people .   
I think I know someone who can move large groups .
”
“ I assigned one to Knock Knock , ” Goddess said .   
“ City Slicker .
”
“
That ’s the one I was thinking of .   
We ’ll get it done , ” Coalbelcher said .
Goddess did n’t respond , did n’t change in expression , or move her head or hands .   
She stared at Coalbelcher , and he shifted his weight a little , before raising his heavy chin , emulating a soldier standing at attention , if a soldier could be of the greasy , drooling - black , baseball cap sort .
“
You have a choice , Coalbelcher .   
My power is telling me there ’s something about you that I should be wary of .
”
“ I have no idea what you mean .   
You ’re promising power , fame , fortune , a territory of my own , and a slice of normal pie after two years of living in this shithole we slapped together here ?   
I ’m all about that .   
I ’m
yours , I ’m loyal .
”
“
Perhaps , ” she said .   
She turned her head , found someone , and indicated for them to come .
It was Crock o’ Shit .   
The lie - detector .   
The tattoos of scales on her arms were standing out slightly in relief .
“
Say it again .   
That you ’re loyal , and that I do n’t need to worry about you .
”
“
I ’m loyal .   
You do n’t need to worry about me .
”
Crock o’ Shit nodded .   
“
He ’s fine .
”
“
He does n’t feel fine , ” Goddess said .   
“ If something happens , Coalbelcher , if something occurs to you , a thought that you have n’t fully formed , a memory that surfaces , an idea you ’re not quite ready to have yet , consider it very carefully .   
It may matter more than you think , and your entire fate hinges on the decision you make .
”
“
Yes ma’am , ” he replied , his voice nasally .   
He horked up something and spat it off to the side .   
The spit was like a gunshot , silent but bullet - quick and violent , with a chunky black splatter that smoked visibly .   
His voice was slightly less nasal as he finished , “ I ’ll think carefully .
”
She dismissed Coalbelcher with a sweep of the hand .
“
I ’m in alignment , ” I said .   
“ We all are , in Breakthrough , Natalie excepted .
”
“ Natalie ?
”
“ Our lawyer , the civilian .
”
She looked mildly annoyed that Natalie had even been brought up in that context .   
She glanced at Crock .
“
They ’re fine , ” Crock o’ Shit said .
“ They feel like an ambient danger , ” Goddess said .   
“ Stay where I can see you , Breakthrough .
”
“ You should know , we disabled the ankle - bombs , ” I said .   
“
Your army should be safe .
”
“ Mm , ” Goddess made a noise , not even a full word .   
I could see a sheen of sweat , where hair was sticking to her head near her temple .   
More sweat shone at the back of her neck .
“
Are you okay ?
” Sveta asked .
“
This was easier the first time , ” Goddess said .   
“
A decision I made as a teenager , to take over , solve all of the problems .   
Eternal youth , through my cocoon man , beauty , endless wealth and power .   
It was fine .
”
“
It sounds great , ” Lookout said .
“ Then it was all taken away .   
Each and every one of my enemies expects me to take it back , which forces me to do just that , because a third of them would eliminate me , a third would enslave me to use me , and another third would castrate me and take … everything vital to me .   
All of my power .   
That castration would n’t guarantee I ’m saved from the first two groups .
” We were silent .
“
I feel it .   
My danger sense makes me aware of the proportions , and how close they each loom .
”
“
Do you want a hug ?
”
Lookout asked .
“
I want my enemies crushed and gone , ” Goddess said .   
“ Be ready to assist in the fighting if they get this far .
”
“ Yes ma’am , ” I said .
“ The Wardens will strike in a matter of minutes .   
They ’re partially protected from me , so timing will be critical .   
Teacher will also time his attack , delivering the Mathers woman , in the hopes I stick my hand into the trap .   
Be ready .   
Maybe you could die in the fighting and simplify things .
”
“ If it helps , then sure ! ”
Lookout said .
“ I ’d rather not , ” I said , putting a hand on Lookout
’s shoulder .
“
I was joking , ” Lookout said .
“
Mm , ” Goddess said .   
She fixed her hair and her collar-
I was n’t sure why , since she could look like anything and nobody here would mind , and then she lifted herself off the ground .
Wardens inbound .
“
I hope it ’s not Weld with the Wardens , ” I said .
“ Tell me about it , ” Sveta replied , voice soft .
“ Or Vista , or Miss Militia … or anyone , ” I said .   
I grit my teeth .   
“
Are you guys ready ?
”
“ I do n’t have stuff , ” Lookout said .   
“
Maybe if there ’s a computer somewhere nearby , I can track things in the city , or do a quick repair of my phone .
”
“ We ’ll check inside , ” I said .   
“ Capricorn , Rain , Swansong , Damsel , you guys handle the front line ?
”
“
Leave me Sveta and the prosthetic body ?   
I ’ll see what I can do to get things working , ” Rain said .
“ Please , ” Sveta said .
“
No promises , ” Rain said .
“
So after I made a big deal about not wanting to split up , we ’re splitting up ?
”
Lookout asked .
I frowned .
“
Sorry to be needy , ” she said .   
“
I just , you know , heh , I ’m a bit weird after the whole ‘ tear your throat out’ thing .
”
“
You ’re a bit weird always , ” Rain said .   
“
But so are the rest of us , so you ’re in good company .
”
“
Yeah , ” Lookout said .   
“
Listen , it ’s okay , I”ll manage something somehow , I ’ll get stuff fixed , and I ’ll have a neat trick .   
Maybe I can supercharge my light gun and we can blind an entire attacking force .   
Then-
”
“
Lookout , ” I interrupted her .   
“
We ’re short on time .   
Let me go get a computer from the entrance building .   
I will bring you tech .   
Good ?
”
“
Good , ”
Lookout said , breathless .
Good .
I took off .
We were fighting the Wardens , now .   
We were fighting Mama Mathers .   
Us against the world , and it did n’t feel triumphant .   
It felt like we were up against the whole fucking world .   
Multiple worlds .
I was spooked , and I was n’t happy .   
I did n’t like this , even as I could take it as necessary .   
We did n’t have a choice , just as Goddess had n’t .
I saw Crystalclear with Fume Hood .   
I dropped to the ground .   
One foot slipped in mud , the other hit ice - hard soil .
“
Five second recap , ”
I said .   
“ Wardens are coming , be ready to fight .   
Teacher ’s bringing in the big guns , one is Mama Mathers .   
If she does n’t come from the city , it ’s going to be up to all of us to deal with what she does , capture and kill her despite the insanity effect .
”
Crystalclear made a face .   
He ’d be vulnerable .
“
Five second response , ” he said .   
“
They would n’t let me talk to Ratcatcher , but she seems healthy , if irritable .   
I tried to check on your lawyer , but again- ” “ No contact , ” I said .   
“
I ’m getting a computer
and then I ’ll be back .
”
“ Good luck ! ”
Natalie .   
I flew toward the building , finding Natalie while I was on my way .   
Lights were few and far between , so the entire group of staff was huddled beneath a lip of rock , one light shared by a hundred people .   
Natalie was fairly close to the front , near the assistant warden , her fingers pressed together and to her mouth for warmth .
Nothing I could do .   
I ’d tried to create an opportunity .
Ratcatcher was easier to find again , since she was mounted on one of the trucks in a group that was being used to produce light , headlights cutting through the mist of freezing rain , people ’s breath , and people ’s body heat .
She saw me , and then she looked away , the rain - soggy cone of her paper mask making the direction she was facing abundantly clear .   
Similar to what I ’d seen with Cryptid , with Chris .
A rebuke ?
No , this was n’t a rebuke .   
I saw the nose move as she angled her head to check where I was in the sky , looking askew at me , then the nose moved again .
Pointing .   
A staff building .
I changed direction .
She ’d done something before getting caught .   
What ?   
I did n’t even know her power for sure .   
Rodent control ?   
It was supposed to be thinker .
I was n’t sure what I ’d expected .   
My heart had been frozen in my chest for what felt like fifteen or twenty minutes , and now it pounded .   
The building interior was dark , with many lights burned out or broken , and the contents of offices , of trash cans , and the papers that had topped desks were now strewn everywhere .
“ Hello ! ?
”
I called out .
She ’d been in the tunnel , and she ’d run .   
She ’d gone through the vents and … she ’d come here ?   
A small building with offices and files .
Chairs , a bench , plants .   
No animals to be seen- no rodents .
I shivered .
Paperwork , file folders , filing cabinets , with drawers pulled out and thrown into walls with enough force to make dents and holes .   
Nothing about or in the dents or holes , that I could see .
More benches for sitting and waiting , with metal loops embedded in the walls for prisoners to be handcuffed to .   
Paperwork , more paperwork , another potted plant , a vending machine that had been raided , the chips and candies that had n’t been eaten now piled on the ground beneath the shattered glass pane .   
A few feet away , there was blood .   
Not from the vending machine .
The blood was part of a trail of splatters leading to a dead guard , one of the metal loops for handcuffing prisoners now embedded in his chest cavity .   
I felt for a pulse , and I knew there was n’t one .
My heart pounded harder than before , feeling the lack of a pulse .
What could he have told me ?
I reached the end of the hallway , found the stairs , and flew in a zig - zag to navigate the flights .   
The building only had two floors , and the damage to the second was negligible , nothing strewn around , most offices locked .
I shivered a bit more .
Lookout was expecting me to deliver a computer .   
I was-
I was chasing a vague hint from a girl in a paper mask , if it could even be called a hint .
“ Hello ! ?
”
I called out , again .
Back down to the first floor .   
I stared down the length of it .
She ’d left the tunnel , and she ’d done what ?
She ’d been caught , just like Natalie .   
She ’d caused enough of a fuss that they ’d tied her up , despite the fact that she was aligned .
Was she aligned ?
The tainted food- the drugged food .
Natalie had had her bound hands pressed to her mouth .   
Had she been warming her breath , or had I caught a glimpse of something in the way of a message ?
They ’d crossed paths , met , collaborated .
I flew down the hallway .   
The stuff from the vending machine .   
Bags of chip that were half air and half chip .   
Boxes of candy .   
Many were damaged .   
Some were dirty , in a way that could have meant they ’d been walked on .
I held the candies , and I hesitated .   
It was hard to convince myself to .   
It felt disloyal .
Master - stranger protocols .   
I imagined Natalie with her fingers to her mouth , like it was a mimed order .   
Driven by an impulse , feeling like I was potentially about to take poison , I took the most dirty , most damaged package , opened a hole wider , and then tipped a few of the gummy candies back into my mouth .
In the distance , it sounded like Goddess was tearing a mountain out of the ground .
I chewed , tasting the chemicals and preservatives of the candy , something I ’d never been a huge fan of , and
… it tasted delicious .
I swallowed , turning my head toward the ceiling in the process , and I closed my eyes .
Was it just candy ?
A part of me wanted it to be .   
A part of me wanted an excuse to feel less uneasy .   
The conflict was brewing and- and good people were going to get hurt .   
Goddess was- ⊙ -fucked in the head .
Fuck her .
Fuck this .
I hope your fucking danger sense is making your head spin , Lady in Blue .
I grabbed the other candies and chips , favoring the broken bags .   
When my hands were full , I speared them on the spikes of my costume .
Style be damned .
How had they managed it ?   
The building had been collapsed .
Rats .   
Mice .
It might have been Natalie who gave Ratcatcher the direction , Ratcatcher who did the lifting .   
Had they known they were going to be caught , and laid this as a trap ?   
Something that anyone coming through might pick up and share ?
Coalbelcher would ’ve been near Natalie , if he ’d been protecting her or watching out for her as part of the deal .   
Had he taken some candy ?   
Had he eaten some , or did he have it saved for later ?   
Was that why Goddess did n’t like her sense of him ?   
I could see him being loyal but not aligned , or aligned but carrying tainted candy .   
More the former , since he did n’t seem the type to save something for later .
I reached the first large group , near the interim portal .
“ Chips or candy ?
” I asked .
“
What ? ”
“
There ’s a big fight brewing , ” I said .   
“
We need to get energy up , and there ’s not much food .   
Do you want chips ?   
Candy ?
”
“ Chips , fuck
yeah ,
” a guy said .
“ Share , ” I said , with emphasis .
With luck , he ’d have one or two , it would kick in , and he ’d start sharing out of spite .
I sure was .
Another group .   
It might have been Auzure , though it was n’t members I recognized .   
They ’d come to help defend the portal and stall for time .
I just threw them the candy .   
The woman who caught it saluted .
“ Share !
” I said .
Goddess should be getting pinged pretty hard right now , if this is working like I hope .
Another hero group .   
I tossed them two small bags of chips .
Hopefully it got us another set of non - Goddessed allies .
There was a chance that some of this was n’t treated .
I just had to hope that most or some of it was .   
We were picking a massive fight .
A small gang of criminals .   
I threw them something , and I did n’t wait for a response .
Rain streamed down around me , drumming against my costume , loud against the plastic of the chip bags and the bags and boxes that had the candy .
I saw my team .
“
No computer ?
”
Lookout asked .   
“
Were they all broken ?
”
“
Something better , ” I said .   
I tossed her a bag of candy , then tossed another to Rain .
“ Uh , ” Rain said .   
“
The sentiment ’s appreciated but … ”
“ Eat .   
Energy , ” I said .
“
Mind trading , Kenz ?
”
Rain asked .
“ You do n’t like grape ?
”
“ Not this type , no , ” he said .
“ Only because I like you , ” she said .
I felt like my heart was beating so fast
it would give everything away .   
I focused on the distance .
“
It ’s bad , ” Byron said .   
“
You ca n’t see it right this second , but she ’s altering landscapes .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“ I heard .
”
There was another blast .   
Another sound like a mountain was being uprooted .   
The ground shook , and this time my feet were touching it to really feel the impact .
Not a mountain- a building , with some foundations .   
I saw it move .   
From a distance , it seemed to move very slowly .   
I knew that it would be moving at a dangerous speed if one was actually at the scene .
Kenzie , her mask still open so her eyes , nose and mouth were visible , her face otherwise enclosed by the helmet , looked up at me .   
I raised an eyebrow , and saw her nod slightly .
“ Ash .   
Want grape gummies ?
”
“
That sounds atrocious .
”
“ Atrocious in the best way , ” Kenzie said .
Swansong took two .   
Damsel did the same .   
I watched as the candy was shared around .   
Kenzie cracked Sveta ’s ball open to give her some .
“
Nice fashion , ”
Swansong told me , indicating the packages that had yet to be delivered , speared to my shoulder .   
“
I prefer less colorful accessories .
”
There were few enough that I could pluck them free .   
I held the assorted packages in two hands .
“
Ahh , ” Swansong said .   
She met my eyes .   
“
Good candy .
”
“
How the heck did you find this ?
”
Lookout asked .
“
Others did the legwork , ” I said .   
Relief surged through me .
“ Guys ! ”
Sveta shouted .
The momentary peace was disturbed .
One of the buildings in the distance had changed trajectory .   
Two stories of apartment building flew end over end as it soared toward us , shedding a stream of concrete fragments .
“ Look out !
”
I shouted , at the top of my lungs .
I put my arms out , and I flew .   
I caught Lookout and Swansong , and Lookout had Sveta .   
I almost had a grip on Damsel , but she slipped free , moving her hands to avoid slashing my hand and arm open rather than cling .   
My flight was uneven , and my burdens heavy and awkward enough that I did n’t feel confident flying up .
Tristan and Rain were running , trying to get clear .
It was already so dark , the night so chaotic , that I could n’t fully process what happened as it hit .   
The casualties , the devastation , whether other teams had been caught in it .   
The rush of air threw me off course , and my grip on my team members was broken .   
Everyone rolled , tumbled , or otherwise sprawled .   
Damsel used her power to shoot at the incoming projectile .
I could see most of the team .
I ’d dropped the candies .   
If only I ’d kept them on my armor .
The Lady in Blue .   
It had been her , reacting to danger sense , hurling a building .
Now I could see her , flying toward us .
She landed , shaking her head as she did .
The dust seemed like too little for the impact and the size of the chunk of building .   
It might have been the rain , or the darkness obscuring some of it .
I could see Lung .   
Other teams , people I had definitely not given candy to , were converging on our location , supporting the Lady in Blue .
I could see Amy , in the background .   
She did nothing to help .   
She was silent , passive .   
A ghost to haunt me .
My costume shifted around me .   
The Lady in Blue lifted me into the air by my costume .
Not all people who could affect inorganic things only could do that .   
Sometimes just being adjacent to something organic made it hard to manipulate inorganic materials .
I fought with my flight .   
She held me firm .   
I activated the Wretch , then deactivated it as soon as I saw that Lookout was too close , just below me .
One by one , she plucked up the members of Breakthrough .
Her head turned .   
Dirt and mud sprayed sky - high as she used her power .   
Dealing with another attacker .   
Someone I ’d given candy to ?
The dirt and mud had n’t even finished raining down when she used her power again .   
I saw the shape of him , leaping to one side .   
He was more visible in the cloud of dirt , rain and mud than he was ordinarily .
Black feathers on black background .
I could feel the dim impulse that she pushed out .   
The punctuation mark .   
The power to control .
He moved faster .
I felt it again .   
This time , he dropped to all fours .
“
Harder !
”
Crock o’ Shit shouted , from the sidelines .   
“
You almost had him !
”
The Lady in Blue used her power again , more forcefully than before .
Cryptid leaped .
I saw the moment of hesitation , the moment of realization that there was nothing inorganic on him to grab .   
She ripped up the earth instead .   
He was thrown into the air , lost in the flurry of mud .
I used my power , hard .   
To distract , to break her focus .
Appearing sooner than should have been possible , Cryptid was right next to her .   
The ground broke under his feet , point blank this time .
It did n’t go any further than the cracking of ground .   
Cryptid ’s talons found the Lady in Blue ’s midsection .   
He tore her open , sternum to pelvis , and his talons hooked into vital organs .   
He pulled them free , and all of the strength went out of her .
For how much damage had been done , it took four or five surprising seconds before her power canceled out .   
We dropped out of the air , and I flew to catch Lookout before she could land too awkwardly .
All around us , people were shuffling closer .
Amy was among them .
Cryptid was at the center , his broken neck twisted around , his head dangling .   
His beak was like a curved blade , gleaming in the rain , pointed at the small of his back .
I could see what that was supposed to mean , now .
Crock o’ Shit had n’t been telling the truth .   
Goddess’ power had n’t almost worked .   
Crock had been among the people I ’d given candy to , just before I ’d reunited with the group .
Fitting .
I could n’t bring myself to enjoy the irony .
“ Chris , ” Lookout said .
Cryptid looked at her , then seized his head .   
He moved it side to side .   
Shaking it in a ‘ no’ .
“
Did Amy do this ?
” I asked .
“
I did n’t do anything , ”
Amy ’s voice cut through the dark and the patter of rain .   
“ Organized .   
Struck a deal .
” I swallowed hard .   
“ Deal ?
”
She would n’t look me in the eyes .   
“
Everyone !
”
I could n’t remember her shouting .   
She ’d never been one to do it .
“
Everyone !   
You have a choice !   
We are going to Earth Shin !   
We are going to be an authority !
”
I could n’t bring myself to speak .
Sveta did it for me .   
“ Amy !
”
Amy shook her head , glancing at Sveta .   
“
There will be rules !   
This means submitting to my power !   
It will not be as Goddess’ was !   
You ’ll follow a code of laws , you ’ll maintain control and peace , and you ’ll protect populations .   
You ’ll be reasonably good !   
Or you can stay here .   
You ’ll be freer , but you ’ll also be a target for heroes !
”
She planned this .
I looked at Cryptid .
She planned this with him .
Dot was perched on her shoulders , clearly excited , but Amy ’s expression was impossible to read .
“
What the hell are you doing ?
” I asked .
She met my eyes .
She looked almost angry as she looked away .   
As if she had the fucking right .
“
Come with us or stay .   
It ’s your choice , ” she said .   
She looked at Cryptid .   
“ Is that okay ?
”
Cryptid seized his head , and moved it in a ‘ yes’ motion .
Amy ’s expression was both angry and sad as she surveyed everything .   
Freezing rain streaked down her hood , and her breath fogged .
She met my eyes .
“ Red Queen , ” Lookout said , under her breath .   
“ Dot called her that .
” My skin crawled .
The Red Queen started to walk away .   
Cryptid was at her side .
Some prisoners were fairly quick to leave to follow .   
Ones who knew her from the Birdcage ?   
With them went followers , and once a critical amount had left , a majority followed .   
Only the heroes really stayed .
Only rubble dust , and mud , now .   
Scarcely any lights on this hillside .
“
What ?   
Chris ?
”   
Lookout asked .   
She giggled , sounding uncertain and Swansong pulled her into a hug , so Lookout ’s face was buried in Swansong
’s side .   
It would have been a full - body hug if Lookout had n’t been hugging the orb .
What just happened ?
Others were arriving now .   
Natalie was with the prison staff .   
Ratcatcher was with Crystalclear and Fume Hood .   
They seemed to be free of the influence of the Lady in Blue .
Who had been practically torn in half , now lying ten feet away from me .   
After seeing my- seeing Amy like that , the grisly scene was somehow one of the least shocking things in the midst of all of this .
“
He was just waiting for an opening ?
”
Rain asked .
“
Shh .
”   
Swansong .
The assistant warden drew closer .   
We ’d been some of the people on point through all of this .   
He wanted answers .
I did n’t have any .   
Amy ?
“ We need to- to do something about this , ” I said .
“
Are you up for it ?
” Byron asked .
I shook my head .   
Images of Amy and the sounds of her voice were weighing on my mind , interrupting half of my thoughts .
I reached out for Sveta ’s ball .   
Lookout handed it over .
“
Sorry , ” I told Sveta .   
I hugged the ball tight .   
“
Sorry .
”
I felt her forehead thunk against the side of the orb .
“
Okay , ” Byron said .   
“
I ’m officially passing the baton … we both know you ’re good at this part .
”
He blurred .   
Once I realized what he was saying , a second or so later than I should have , I could understand it .
I nodded .








“
It ’s hard to know where to draw the line sometimes , ” Sveta confessed .
We were standing at the crosswalk .   
We ’d just met near the station , hugged , and were heading down toward the city core .   
I ’d just come from my physical therapy for my arm and having a doctor look at the burn on my arm , and I had the buzz of the recent exercise , the endorphins from the pain , all on top of the feeling of being freshly showered and toweled off .
No costume- only a sweater , jeans , boots , and a gray wool coat with overly elaborate buckles .   
I did have my bag with me , but I was n’t packing the costume inside .   
No equipment , but with the buzz , clean feeling , and endorphins , I had all of the emotional armor and preparation I could pull together for seeing family .
Snow fell lazily around us , but the vehicles on the road and their hot exhaust were generating just enough heat to keep the streets wet but clear snow and ice .   
The sidewalks where pedestrians were n’t active were getting covered by a layer that sat just over top of the ice that lingered from the on - and - off freezing rain of the past two days , adding to its slickness .   
Sveta ’s hair , my hair , and our coats were dusted with snowflakes .
“ Sveta , ” I said , giving my friend a careful look , trying to think of how I could diplomatically phrase my response , “ You have better lines than most people I know , and most people I know are superheroes .  
What the fuck are you talking about ?
”
“ With you , ” she said .   
“
Sorry .   
I do n’t know when to stop myself or when to keep going , because I have n’t had a lot of friends over the years .   
I ’m not good with friend dilemmas .
”
“
Ah , ” I said .   
I paused .   
“
I did n’t want to put you in the middle of a dilemma .   
Whatever it is .
”
Sveta squeezed my arm .   
She was leaning on me for balance , as her body was n’t quite in perfect working order and the sidewalks were slick .   
“
It ’s not a thing you did .   
Um .   
Sorry , I do n’t want to get too deep into it , which is part of it .   
I do n’t want to bum you out .
”
“ We can talk .   
I trust you .
”
“
It ’s more-
” she started .   
The light changed , and after a second , we started forward .   
“
We ’ve seen each other at our worst , right ?   
On the baddest of bad days , when we just needed a shoulder , we helped each other out .
” I nodded .
“
And I know where you come from .   
I knew and believed what you were saying when you brought up your sister .
”
“
Yeah .   
You backed me up when I did n’t trust myself to say anything to her .
”
“ Even with that
, I do n’t know where that line is .   
People have their boundaries , usually , and they draw them out behind them through a hundred signals , some really subtle , and some obvious .   
And yours is … very hard to identify until I ’m in contact with it or you ’re already in that very bad place .   
All of us are actually pretty bad about it , but yours is especially tricky because I care a shitton about you .
”
“
Yeah , ” I agreed .   
“
I wo n’t argue that .   
Thank you .   
I ’ve actually been thinking about that , actually .   
How the team is dealing , the past couple of days , post - Prison .
”
“
Turning on the heaters , turning on the televisions and radios , and watching the news with a dull , sick feeling .
”
“
… Ca n’t argue the sick feeling either .   
But we seem to be doing reasonably well , ” I said .   
“
Not great , but that was n’t a situation that was going to be great for anyone .   
I think we ’re getting distracted .
”
“
A mass breakout of the emergency prison , mind control , your sister showing up and her leaving with Chris ?   
Yeah , distracting .   
But go on .
”
“
I ’m thinking about how we deal and how we adapt .   
The lines , the boundaries and the secrets .   
Jessica wanted me to look after the team , and … Chris happened .
”
“ You ca n’t blame yourself for failing to help someone who actively resisted help , ” Sveta said .   
“ You tried .   
You showed up at his place , asked his guardian some questions about how he was doing , and she responded with worry ?   
He blew up , and I think he blew up because he wanted to keep you from looking further .   
And it worked .   
Whatever he had going on , he somehow decided we were n’t the answer .   
He heard what you had to say about your sister , and he still went with her .   
Fuck him .
” I was trying to be tough , but something in that final combination of words tested my resolve .   
Maybe it was the emphatic ‘ fuck’ , so close to the mention of her .
I ’d deal .   
I had to , because it tied into what I wanted to push forward to the group .
“ We ’ve done that thing a lot of teams end up doing , ” I said .   
“
We had that one tough fight .   
That one scenario where we ’re outmatched or we go up against the person who tests or breaks convention .   
For my family it might have been Marquis .   
For the Major Malfunctions , it might have been turning up for a routine surveillance job and getting a literal army of mind controlled thralls teleporting into their neighborhood .
”
“ Going through hell and making it out the other side with the team .
”
“
Yeah .   
For varying definitions of hell and ‘ making it’ .   
We ’ve had our trial by fire .   
We have our first real loss after losing Chris .   
All of us have had cause or reason to reveal some deeper stuff .
”
“
You especially .
”
I shrugged the shoulder she was leaning on .   
“ I do n’t know .   
All
I ’m
saying is … we might have to shift how we do this .   
We ’ve protected and defended each other having secrets .   
We had that ‘ it ’s complicated’ card that we could always pull .   
It might be time to stop that .   
To have no more secrets .
”
“ Easier said than done .
”
“
Yeah .   
But if we ca n’t trust each other-
”
“
I think it ’s a great idea , ” Sveta interrupted .   
“
Do n’t get me wrong .   
I ’m anxious about the team , and it ’s been worse since … everything those two nights .   
Not just Chris , but getting a live - action roleplay , complete with all of the feelings of betrayal , as you end up acting like my enemy ?
”
I could hear the anxiety in her voice at that last line .   
I gave her a jostle , before shifting my grip to put my arm around her shoulders .   
She leaned her head against my shoulder , in a way that might have made walking hard if she ’d had an ordinary body and balance .
She continued , “ It would be nice to not have to wonder as much .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
We do this thing where we prove we have the chops because we can win fights , but the group gets a little shakier where things are already shaky .   
I ’m not omitting myself from that , either .   
I want to have the chops and not be so shaky when doing it .
”
“
Yes .   
Absolutely yes , ” Sveta said .   
She lifted her head up from my shoulder .   
“
Speaking of shaky …
”
She pointed at our destination .
We ’re here .
“
Yeah , ” I acknowledged her .
“
Hey , ” she injected fake cheer into her voice .   
“ Upside !   
Teeny - tiny upside .
”
“
What ’s that ?
” I asked .
“ You get to watch them eat crow .
” I sighed .   
I shook my head .
“
No ?
”
I shook my head .
The office building was packed .   
There was a lobby , and I saw two young employees sitting on the floor , papers around them .   
Overall , given the hour of the attack , the issue with the portals had done far more damage to real estate than it had done to the population .   
As people had resumed work , they ’d needed to go somewhere , and this was one such somewhere .   
A building that now overflowed with people .
I craned my head a bit before spotting my mom .   
My dad was a short distance away , and he ’d at least tossed the athletic - fit sports clothes in favor of something nicer , like a thirty year old guy might wear out to dinner .   
He was n’t thirty , but I ’d take what I could get .
Someone had pointed us out , because he turned to look ,
my mom following , once she noticed him looking .
Neither smiled .
It had been two days since the prison breakout .   
One day to recuperate and lick our wounds .   
Medical care for me and Rain , prosthetic body fixes for Sveta .   
Rain , Ashley and Damsel had needed to get some baseline things squared away with their sentences .
Needed , but had n’t gotten .   
It was a big , ominous question mark floating over their heads now .
One day for that .   
One day to catch our breath after that .   
Because recuperating and healing was work .   
The second day served to let us ground ourselves again .   
Kenzie had maintained contact with people online , but as part of our unofficial , unspoken ‘ taking care of ourselves’ day , it made sense that she would take care of herself by reaching out . 
 
This was our day three .   
Our day to consolidate .   
I ’d been talking about that from a distant , logical perspective , new rules , approaches , or policies , but I would have to tackle the more emotional , vague perspective later .
And , in another kind of ‘ consolidation’ , of focusing on bonds and promises and all the things that tied us together , I ’d have to deal with a team of a much different sort .   
The sort that virtually everyone was born into .
“
You did n’t answer your emails , ” my mom scolded me .
Right out of the gates .
“ I answered some .   
If I did n’t answer any , I would n’t be here .
”
“
You know what I mean .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“
I ’m glad you were willing to meet ,
” my dad said .   
“ Hi Sveta .   
It ’s so good to see you again .
”
“ I love the coat , ” my mom said .
“ It ’s borrowed , actually , ” Sveta said .   
Her coat was one of my spares , for when I ’d had to spend long durations outside during my stint at the Patrol , during the winter that I ’d lost fifteen pounds and had suddenly found the cold very much affected me .   
Bulky and nondescript- not a coat that one would ‘ love’ .   
Moms .
“
Do you want to go somewhere private to talk ?
” I asked .
“
This way , ” my mom said .
She led us outside , then down the street .   
“
This is the cafe we visit when we have to have more private meetings .   
The board rooms at the office were converted into more offices .   
It ’s quiet here .
”
Quiet was one way of putting it .   
Typically in the late morning , delis like this could be counted on to be transitioning from breakfast to lunch , with a few people having extended brunches .   
There was one other couple in the place .
We found a booth and sat .
“ I know you probably have questions , ” I said .
“ We ’ve heard a lot about what happened , ” my mom said .   
“ The bullet points .   
That includes your sister , though , she is n’t mentioned much .
”
“
She was n’t there much , ” I said .   
Why was this so hard ?   
“
The Lady in Blue had a danger sense , and my sister was so nonthreatening that she did n’t trip it .   
She did n’t do anything until it was ninety - five percent over .   
Then she was the final five percent .
”
“
We heard about that , ” my dad said .   
“
She sent us a message before disappearing to Earth Shin .
”
“
And ?
” I asked .
“
She says she can do more good there .   
You wanted her to leave and to give you space
and she ’s doing that , ” he said .
My mom leaned forward over the table .   
“
She was optimistic she could play a part in repairing human - cape relationships and use her power as a bargaining chip to broker peace and better relationships between Shin and Gimel .
”
“
Ah , ” I said .
My dad chimed in , “ Being as objective as I can , she ’s doing something good .   
She knows we ’re in for a hard winter , and if she can promise peace and stability in exchange for some surplus food being sent our way ?   
It could save an incredible number of lives .   
Millions .   
And she ’s doing it while giving you your space .
”
“ Space ?   
Two nights ago she tried to catch me by surprise and touch me .   
It was a meeting she requested that set off all of the worst events of that night .   
I ’m supposed to smile and accept all of that ?
”
“
It ’s not an all - in - one package , Vicky , ” my dad said .   
“
We can celebrate the good things while working on the bad .
”
I shook my head .   
Frustration was getting the better of me , despite my earlier resolve .
“
If I can- ” Sveta jumped in .   
“
I know this is a family matter , and I ’m not family .
”
“
You ’re close enough , ” my dad said .
I could see Sveta was a little taken aback by that .   
Enough that she lost whatever it was that she had planned on saying .
He went on , “ You looked after Victoria when she was in the hospital .   
I ’m so grateful that you were there for her in times
we could n’t be .   
If you ever wanted a place to go for a holiday , if you wanted a say or a vote , I think you earned it .
”
“
Well said , ” I said to my dad .
“ Stop , ” Sveta said , flustered .   
“
You ’re making it hard to think .
” I leaned back in my seat .
“
Mr. and Mrs. Dallon .   
I understand that Amy can do an incredible amount of good , if she puts her mind to it .   
If it were Vicky in that position , I would trust her to do it .   
But it ’s not Vicky .
”
“
You know Vicky
well , ” my mom said .   
“
You have n’t had the same exposure to Amy .   
She had years of helping people under her belt before she broke down .   
In the face of the Slaughterhouse Nine .
”
“
I know Vicky
but I ’ve seen Amy ’s work .   
Can we try a thought experiment ?   
If you do n’t mind ?
”
“
I do n’t mind , ” my mom said .
“
Pretend that we had the same timeline , starting from now .   
Something like three years of her helping people , a tremendous amount of help .   
Giving her all-
”
“
Burning out , ” I said .
“ Burning out , yes , ” Sveta added my bit .   
“
Feeling pressured , feeling desperate .   
Pretend it was three years of that , and then she comes face to face with a monster .   
And she breaks down again .   
What if she ends up repeating the cycle , and she repeats it while seven point three billion people are at her mercy ?   
What then ?
”
It was all I could do to just keep my mouth shut and stay at the table .   
I did n’t like pretending , even though I ’d tried to put it out of mind .
“
That ’s entirely unfair , ” my mom said .
“
Why ?
”
Sveta asked , her eyes wide .   
“
We all relapse when it comes to our bad behaviors , and when dealing with someone like her , we have to use past experience to judge how she might act in the future .   
If that sounds unfair , keep in mind , that ’s how I deal with thinking about myself .
”
“
People change , ” my mom said , giving each word its own emphasis .
“
People change , but if you knew someone who negligently discharged a handgun , if their core behavior had n’t changed , would you really trust them around children with a gun ?
”
“ It would depend on context , and your definition of core behavior .   
I know you mean
well , Sveta , but
there is so much more to this .
”
Sveta shook her head .   
She tried to tap a metal finger on the table , but the hand kind of splatted out instead .   
She did n’t seem to mind or pay much notice .   
“
Keep in mind that it ’s not just one child at stake here .   
Seven point three billion people , that ’s how many kids ?
”
“ Roughly twenty - five percent , ” I said .   
“
One point eight billion kids .
”
“
One point eight billion kids .   
We have n’t seen that she ’s changed , ” Sveta said .
Carol shook her head .   
“
There ’s more at play than core behavior patterns .   
If that person had a support network keeping a close eye on them , when they had n’t before ?   
Caring parents and a sister ?   
If she proved willing to listen to outside input , including a therapist ?
”
“
She was n’t listening the other night , ” I said .
“ To be frank , young lady , ” my mother said .   
“
You were under the influence of a power .
”
“ To be frank , mom , she was fucking why !
”
“ Quiet now , ” my mom said , all composure .   
Her voice was infuriatingly calm .   
“
There are other people in the room .
”
She had a slight smile on her face as I sat back , reeling myself in .
That seething fury found its way into my voice as I kept the rest of my words level .   
“
I was n’t under the influence when she was meeting up with a tyrant in the weeks leading up to the prison breakout .   
Not Marquis , by the way .   
She ’s hanging out with him too , but I ’m going to assume we ’re conveniently ignoring
that- ” “ Let ’s , ” my mom said .
“
She ’s keeping the company of some pretty scummy people .   
She has a fucking miniature devil on her shoulder , like some villain from a feature length kid ’s animation .   
That ’s where she ’s at in the past and present .   
Future ?   
We were n’t under the influence after the tyrant was killed , when she said ‘ flock to me , villains , come and submit to my control , we ’re going to Shin to take power!’ ”
“ That does n’t sound great , and it was left out of the call , ” my dad said .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
It ’s not the exact wording , but it’s- ”
“
It was close to that , ” Sveta volunteered .
“
It was close , ”
I finished my sentence , echoing her .
“
Past , she was overworked and we failed her , ”
my mom said , her voice stern .   
“
All of us failed her .   
Present , she ’s alone except for the company of those villains because she ’s scared to maintain contact with us .   
She ’s scrabbling for support structures , and she seems to be maintaining good standards and goals .   
That ’s commendable .   
Future ?   
That ’s up to us .   
People are defined by the supports they have around them .   
If we do n’t give her something to come back to , then she ’s going to stay with them .   
Her perspective will skew , because all perspectives warp when there ’s nobody around to help keep them straight .   
Do n’t use the past - present - future framing of argument on me when I taught it to you .
”
“
Somehow , in all of this , we are n’t holding her accountable for her own actions ?
” I asked .   
“
Because I kind of remember this dynamic of a teenage girl bouncing around and being passed around to wherever she could be useful until she passed briefly into some ugly Slaughterhouse Nine hands and lost it .   
Lost it with casualties in the process .   
Me .   
Herself .   
But also me .   
Then she gets to fucking act like herself for one singularly stupid , horrifying- ” I choked on my words , too pissed to form a sentence .
“
One act , ” Sveta said .
“ Or chain of acts .   
Or one act that sets her on a road where her choices are all bad .   
I do n’t know .   
But she still chose , ” I said .   
“
And she had opportunities later , and she made more bad choices .   
Ones with casualties .
”
I heard my mom sigh .   
The restaurant was so quiet , the city outside even quieter than usual because the cold weather meant people were n’t venturing out as much , it was crunch time at the various jobs around here , and it was still a bit too early for lunch breaks .   
The light snow had its faint effect on the sound of the outside world .
It was so easy to imagine we were all in this place , and there was nobody else in the universe .
My mom spoke , “ If Amy took it upon herself to touch villains and alter the broken reward cycles , if Amy wanted to give them a conscience , or if Amy wanted to fix whatever was broken in their physiology that made them aggressive ,
I ’m not about to say no .   
If there ’s any risk to the-
” I dropped my eyes to the table .   
The ‘ Amy’ refrain was endless and the song was one I did n’t want to hear .   
Amy , Amy , Amy , Amy .   
It was like a rock against my skull .   
Not necessarily enough to penetrate with the first blow , but chipping away , giving me a headache , and so fucking crude , stupid , and raw .
And , worse , it was a refrain that echoed my mentality those two years ago .   
Amy .   
Amy .   
Amy .   
I need her , I want her .   
It had been my mind for all that time . 
 
Sveta touched my arm , rubbing it .   
A bit of physical reality to bring me back to the moment .   
I nodded to a question unasked .
“ -thinkers will be able to detect it , ” Carol said .
Sveta cut in , “ I do n’t care what your views are on how villains are treated , except ,
I ’m sorry , but maybe I do , wow , and
no .   
Or your willingness to put civilians in the hands of your other daughter , who has blood red tattooed on those hands for a reason , which is more wow .   
I ’m sorry , but
what- ”
“ Sveta , ” my mom interrupted her .   
“
I ’ve been doing what I ’ve been doing for- ”
“
-and
I do n’t care , ” Sveta said , more intense , talking over my mom now .
“
I do n’t care , I do n’t care .   
You ’re sitting a few feet from your daughter who spent years with an altered mind because of Amy , and you ’re talking about how you ’d be perfectly okay with Amy altering brains left and right ?   
I ’m sorry ,
what ?   
What ?
”
“
It ’s the matter at hand , Sveta .   
It may well be happening as we speak .   
We have to figure out how we respond to it .
”
“
Mom the fuck up !   
That ’s how you respond to it !
”
Sveta raised her voice .   
That turned heads at the other end of the diner .
“
I ’m trying , ” my mom said , sounding as pissed as I ’d heard her in a while .
“
You ’re trying to help one daughter who might be beyond help , and you ’re fucking up with the daughter who needs it .
”
“ Stop , ” my dad said .   
“
Let ’s end this here ?   
We ’re not getting anywhere , and I think we ’re talking past each other .
”
You barely talked .   
You let mom talk and you nodded here and there to show you were listening and taking it in …
and you did n’t say yes or no or judge .
“ … and Victoria looks like she needs a break .
”
Well , at least he paid attention to me in the midst of it .
“ If we step away without actually communicating , then it ’s going to be a long time before we talk to her again , she ’ll get ideas in her head , and communicating next time will be that much harder .
”
“
We end this here , ” my dad told her .   
“
No debate .   
We ’re probably bothering the diner ’s owners .
”
My mom looked over at him with the most unimpressed look .   
When I rose to my feet , my dad did too , and Sveta started on the process of extricating herself from the booth .
My dad and I offered her a hand , each of us taking one hand .   
She accepted without complaint .   
My mom remained in her seat , leaning back , one arm extended all the way forward , five fingernails resting against the surface of the booth
’s table .
I was so ready to go .   
It struck me only now that we ’d been sitting in the booth and nobody had come to take our orders .   
Maybe we ’d scared them off with the latent hostility and argument .
“
Let ’s go meet the others , ” Sveta said .
The others .   
Oh .   
I turned back toward my mom , and put my bag down .   
“
Can I ask about Natalie ?
”
My mom smiled , and she acted like we had n’t just had a heated exchange of words .   
“
She ’s well .   
Healing from that chest wound while spending some time away with a friend .
”
“
When is she back ? ”
Sveta asked .
“
She said she would be gone for two days , and she told me that yesterday .   
She would have emailed you .
”
“
She probably did , but it would have been lost in the tide of feedback and questions we ’re getting .
”
“ I remember those moments .   
Use them .   
People ask and approach because they ’re interested .   
You want that interest .
”
“
Not today , ” I said .   
“
Today is the day we consolidate .
”
“ Is today a special event ?
” my dad asked .
“
Only that it ’s been too long since we ’ve done it
, ” I said , “ And we really fucking need it .
”
“
Damn straight , ” Sveta said .
“
Can I give you something to pass on to Natalie ?
”
I asked my mom .
“
Of course .
”
I put my bag down and fished inside .   
“
A bit of a thank - you for looking after Lookout and an apology for her having to put up with us while we were mind controlled .   
She did well .
”
“ I have an eye for exceptional people , Victoria , ” my mom said .
“ You do .
”
I handed over the package , gift wrapped as best as I ’d been able with the supplies I ’d had .
“
Stay in touch ?
”
my dad asked .
I drew in a deep breath , then exhaled , looking at my mom , who still sat with her arm out , her other hand resting on the tidy little package .
“ I ca n’t keep doing this , ” I said .   
“ Sticking my hand into the fire and getting burned .
”
“
We ’ll talk , okay ?   
You and me ?
”
my dad asked .
I shrugged .   
My mom looked annoyed at that offer from my dad .
Irreconcilable differences , really .   
There was n’t a good way to handle this .
“
You know where I am , ” he said .
We said our muted goodbyes .   
The door of the diner closed behind Sveta and I , and we stepped into the cold .   
My breath fogged .   
Sveta ’s did n’t .
“
The good news is that my dad extended an invite to Christmas , if you want company .
”
“ Ha ha .
”
“
Come on , ” I told her .   
“
Let ’s go find our teammates .
”
The snow was whipping around us as we returned to the main street .   
I could see a guy across the road , smoking a cigarette while he leaned against a store window .     
He watched the snow not with wonder , but the opposite- a lack of light in his eyes .
People would die as the weather got colder .   
But that would be then .   
The future was in the future , and that future had an Amy - shaped shadow somewhere across it .   
The past was misery .
The present ?   
Today ?   
I could focus on today .   
We would consolidate .
All together .   
Strength and knowledge .
They ’d already departed the train when we arrived .   
I ’d figured the talk with my parents would be intense and problematic , but I had n’t expected it to be long .
It was Byron with a guy with shaggy black hair and scraggly facial hair , and Erin , all sitting on the railings at the top of the stairwell .   
Erin gave me a wave .
Kenzie was bundled up , with pink earmuffs , hair not done up in buns , but parted , the vast majority of her hair at one side of her face , along her temple and cheek .   
She had a black coat , with a nice looking flannel scarf , pink and black – more bundling than was necessary for the weather .
Behind her , two women were talking- thin , both in feminine clothing .   
One had tan skin and light clothes , with a pixie cut , and the other had long black hair , matching clothes , and pale skin .
She spotted us , and she sprinted , running down icy steps , barely touching the railing .
“
Careful ! ”
Sveta called out .
Kenzie reached the bottom stair and threw herself at us , arms wide so one arm caught me and the other caught Sveta .   
Sveta slipped and , despite my efforts , ended up on the ground .
“
Sorry !
”
“
It ’s okay .   
I ’m glad to see you too ,
” Sveta said .   
She made her way back to her feet , then parted ways with me , seizing the railing and heading up toward Erin .
“ See my work ?   
I thought we ’d need to protect identities , ” Kenzie said , looking up at me , her chin touching my stomach .   
“
So I made people projection things .   
It keeps your body type so you can still see what clothes look like , without it getting wonky .
”
“ That sounds work intensive .
”
The guy with shaggy black hair would be Rain then .   
The two girls would be Ashley and Damsel .
“ It was .   
It is .   
But I could n’t sleep anyhow , and I thought I ’d do something productive while I lay in bed .   
And then it became a habit , I ’d work until I fell asleep at my desk or until I got tired .   
Now working on this project makes me tired .   
How are you ?
”
“
I ’m
okay .   
Tough conversation with my parents .   
My mom , specifically .
”
“
I ’m sorry , ” she said .   
She broke the hug .   
“
I ’m
so happy everyone ’s here .
”
“ Speaking of , ” I said .   
I lowered my voice a bit .   
“ Was there a rule you told me about hugging ?
”
“
Oh .   
Um … ” “ Listen , ” I said , and I lowered my voice even more .   
“ I do n’t want to be the bad guy-
”
“ You are n’t .
”
“ -or make you feel like I ’m not happy to see you either .   
But if you had a rule about hugging , then we should keep to that rule , okay ?   
At least until we hear different .
”
“ Okay .
”
“
Do you have other rules ?
” I asked .
“
Yeah .   
A bunch .
”
“
Are you following them ?
”
I saw her look around , like there was a way out .   
I did n’t want to trap her or act like my mom , but
… if this was deemed important then it was important .
Part of consolidating like I wanted to meant avoiding the lies .   
It meant sticking to the rules and keeping things from getting shaky around the foundations .
I had my own shake .   
But Kenzie was especially shaky .   
Especially now .
“
Come on .   
Let ’s make this a good team day .   
We deserve one , ”
I told her .
She nodded with twice the energy that was necessary , no smile on her face .    
I reached for her shoulder , to guide her on the way up steps with ice on them , and she seized my hand in hers instead .   
Quick as a camera flash .
“
You ’re here , ” the long - haired Ashley said .   
“
After leaving us standing around in the cold for as long as you did , you really should buy us something .   
Tribute .
”
Okay , that was Damsel then .   
Hair length matched .   
Easy .
“
It ’s a joke , ” the other said .   
“
You might have guessed , but we ’re not really here .   
We ’re sitting at the apartment , wrapped in blankets .   
We have cups of cider beside us , and a plate of those gourmet chocolates and biscuits on the coffee table .
”
“
That ’s not fair , ” I said .   
I looked down at Kenzie .   
“
That ’s not fair at all .
”
“
Do you know what ’s better ?
” Damsel asked .   
“ When we go buy our clothes , they ’ll fit perfectly .
”
“ I scanned them for measurements , head to toe , ” Kenzie said .
“
That ’s not fair at all , ” I said .   
“
That they get to stay at home with blankets and treats , and they get to go shopping ?
”
“
Having our cake and eating it too , ” Damsel said .   
She touched fingers to her lips and made a smacking kiss sound .
“ If it ’s any consolation , ” the guy with the shaggy black hair said .   
Rain , obviously enough .   
“
I ’m here for real
and I ’m freezing my butt off .
”
“
You ’re in good company , ” Erin said , her arms wrapped around her body and tucked into the opening of her jacket , her body hunched over .   
She gave Rain a sidelong glance .   
“
I feel weirdly disloyal , hanging out with this random guy with black hair and chin scruff .
”
“
I ’m way cooler than that guy ,
” Rain - in - disguise said .
“ Nuh uh , ” Erin responded .
Inch over half a foot , Rain , and put your arm around her , I thought .   
Warm her up .
“
It might help with the butt freeze if you were n’t sitting on a cold metal railing , ” Sveta said .
Rain hopped down , straightened with a stretch , and then shook his head .   
“
Yeah , no , that ’s not better .   
Let ’s get where it ’s warm .
”
“
Let ’s , ” Erin said .
Byron , a little off to the side , was smiling , perfectly content in the twenty - three degree weather .
“
Let ’s go , ” I said .   
“
And let ’s talk mission plan .
”
“
Is this a mission now ?
” Rain asked .
“ Only if it keeps us organized .   
We ’re splitting up , but I want to touch base , especially before any big purchases .   
That ’s partially so we do n’t lose track of each other .   
And also because I ’m really , really curious what some of you are after .   
As far as split - up teams go , I ’m with Sveta , because I owe her
and we ’re ridiculously overdue for this .
”
“
Yes , ” Sveta said .
“
I ’m with the boys , ” Erin said .   
“
They wanted help because they ’re hopeless .
”
“
And I ’ve got the best two people to keep me company , ” Kenzie said .
“ Perfect , ” I said .  
“ We have practical reasons for this and those reasons include updating our costumes for the winter .   
You do that , we can dip into the team funds , consciences clear .   
Within reason .
”
There were nods all around .








“ Here , ” Kenzie said .   
She held out her hand , and I took the little gift .
I turned it over in my hands , as Kenzie skipped over to Sveta , to pass Sveta something similar .   
A hair - clip .   
Mine was sun - shaped .   
Sveta ’s was a sea - shell spiral .   
The others were walking and talking , as we all headed into the mall .
“
I thought since you guys are sort of recognizable , you might want to keep things subtle .   
Yours is n’t very fancy , but it should change up your look a bit , like we did for the others .   
Sveta , you should take one of these packs .   
I gave one to Rain , and I ’m carrying one for the Ashleys .
”
“ A pack ?
”
“ We ’ll go to the bathroom so you can change
serptish- surveillish- ” “ Surreptitiously ?
” I asked .
“
Yeah .   
I ’ll give you something , or I ’ll give it to Victoria , and you can stay close to Victoria .
”
“ Okay , ” Sveta said , leaning on me “ You are n’t overworking yourself ?
” I asked .
“ Only a tiny bit .   
These are easy , it ’s tech I already had .   
The issue was getting somewhere
I could work on it in peace , now that I ’m at the institution .   
I ended up going to the headquarters .
”
“
Alone ?
” Sveta asked .
“
Yeah .   
Turns out
I can do what Chris did , leave and nobody asks questions .   
Part of it is that they think I ’m
a good student
and I ’m obedient
so it ’s okay .
”
“
Yeah , that ’s … not
Chris , ” I said .
“
No , I know .   
He was creepy - scary when he wanted to be .   
I ’m creepily good - nice .   
Same thing in the end .   
It just feels kind of lonely , you know ?   
Bathroom ’s this way .
”
“ I can see it being lonely , yeah , ” I said .
“ I ’m
really missing him .   
That ’s part of it .   
The other part is realizing that there ’s so much you can get away with because most adults are so busy trying to live their lives and deal with a group of kids that one kid does n’t matter .   
I think I ’d be happier if I could n’t get to my workshop at all because they were paying a lot of attention to me .
”
“
I can see that , ” I said .
“
It would be more happiness for a very short time , ” Swansong said .   
“
Then it might feel hollow .   
I ’m glad that your work means we can spend time together like this .
”
Kenzie nodded , excited and sudden .   
“
Right ! ?
”
Silent , I pushed the door to the unisex bathroom open , holding it for the others .   
Rain , Byron , and Erin hung back in the mall
’s concourse while the rest of us went in .
There were people inside , a husband and wife with a baby that they were wholly focused on , taking up three sinks between them .   
I hung back until they were gone , as the Ashleys headed to the sinks furthest from the door , standing side by side as they peered at their reflections .
I hoped that Damsel would n’t be a bad influence on Swansong .
The parents left and most of the stalls were left empty .   
Only one stall to watch for , and we could situate ourselves where we were n’t overheard .
“
There ’s a dial built into it , you might have to tilt it to see , ” Kenzie instructed .   
“
That controls the scope of it .   
I would have liked to have two dials , because you can do an awful lot of exploration with two dials .   
Double - tap the surface to turn it on .   
Oh , let me help you !
”
Kenzie helped Sveta with the hair clip .   
I took the moment to figure out my sun - shaped device .   
The dial required my fingernail to adjust .   
I double - tapped it to turn it on , and my world was swallowed up by a faint checkerboard haze , a transparent screen falling into place around my head and hands , where skin and hair were visible .   
The haze snapped out of existence as the device seemed to figure out where my eyes were , creating eyehole - shaped gaps in the screen , while instead creating greater - than and less - than blurs of shadow to frame my eyes .
A moment later , the checkerboard and the shapes were gone .   
My skin tone changed along my hands , my fingernails now artificially painted .   
In the mirror , I could see hair with darker roots and brighter highlights , twisty as if every lock or length had been wound tightly around a pencil or pen , not treated with heat , but guided in shape all the same .   
The eyes that looked back at me seemed more open .
“ I went through online videos and for each pin
I picked out fifty people who looked similar enough to each of the people
I ’d be giving pins to , then averaged it out .   
When the average was too close to you guys , I pushed it out away from the norm .
”
It was so close to being me , to the point that I could believe someone could get a witness description of me and think this face fit the bill , and it was wholly not me at the same time .   
I changed my expression in the mirror , seeing how the face moved .   
Moving the hand with the pin one way and moving my face another created a brief visual distortion , like what happened when trying to take a panoramic picture that included something moving .
Reminiscent of things , enough that it got my heart rate going .
“
And-
yeah ,
Victoria , you do n’t want to do that .   
It helps if you actually wear the hair clip , duh .   
You should n’t run into problems if you do .   
And Sveta , I put together two options , but I ’m not sure how well option two will work .   
I did n’t have you with me to try it and test it , so I had to guess , based on things .   
Let ’s try smooth .
”
“
Smooth ?
” Sveta asked .
“ I made this one a necklace .   
Here .   
Bend down and I ’ll put it on .
”
Sveta bent down , leaning hard into the sink for balance as she did .   
As Kenzie fiddled , Sveta looked up at me , her eyes searching my face .
“ There .   
Double - tap .
” Sveta did , moving her whole hand to tap , instead of moving fingers as someone else might .
As had happened to me , the white - black checkerboard pattern overlaid her , loose and hovering over her skin .   
It slowly moved to the appropriate surfaces , and then settled .   
The change was minor , but it was because Sveta was bundled up in a huge coat .   
Her face had more skin tone , the features less different from her usual face than my current face was from mine .   
Her hands looked normal .   
She stared down at them .
“
Maybe take that off , so we can be sure , ” Kenzie said , poking at Sveta ’s coat .
When Sveta nodded , I helped her out of the coat , folding it over my arm .   
The necklace took a second to adapt , the checkerboard wrapping around her arms and hands .
When the checkerboard map was settled , it became skin .   
Flesh , from shoulder to fingertip , tattooed heavily down the arms in a design similar to the forest green backgrounds with orange animals that Sveta had painted onto her arms .   
Unlike the paint , however , they ’d faded out as any year - old tattoo might .
“
Can you move your hands around ?   
I ’m wondering if the smoothing works .
”
Sveta turned her hands over , looking at the palms .   
She did n’t move her hands .
“ Svettaaaaa , ” Kenzie said .   
She gave Sveta a bit of a push .   
“ Come on !   
I want to know if this worked .
”
“
Oh .   
Okay .   
What did you want ?
”
“ Move your hands .   
Do stuff .
” Sveta did .   
The movements of her hands did n’t have the mechanical quality .
“
I did that for Ashley Black , and I thought I ’d do it for you too .   
I just wanted to see-
I ’m going to take your hands …
”
Kenzie reached out , grabbed Sveta ’s hands , and them moved them around .   
There was a clear disconnection between where Kenzie ’s hands were and the slow , almost dream - like way that the images of Sveta ’s hands moved .
“
Yeah .   
I worried about that .   
It ’d look weird if you picked something up or if someone moved the map around .   
Next time !   
Here , let me change it .   
Bend down .
” Sveta obeyed .   
Again , she looked up at me , while Kenzie used her fingernails to turn the tiny dial at the underside of the clip .
“ I have other tattoo maps loaded into my phone , if you ’re interested .   
Um , just off the top of my head , lotus flowers , pink and green , and um , watercolor birds and branches … skulls and roses ?   
Do you feel like a badass ?   
Or I can get rid of the tattoos .
”
“
It ’s skulls and roses or nothing , as I see it , ” Ashley Black said , from the other sink .
“
This is good , ” Sveta said , and her voice was small .
I looked over my shoulder at the Ashleys , raising an eyebrow .
“ I know this is a super minor project that probably does n’t matter much at all , but I was still worried about how it would turn out , because a lot of what I do is I get really good images , but then when I do stuff like projections , I ’m trying to find use - sensitive ways of printing those images .   
It ’s like those super old fashioned cameras that would spit out a photo as soon as you took it , but I ’m spitting all over you .   
I had to find videos with a really good coverage of certain body parts , so what I ended up doing was setting up cameras to scan for those and-
”
“ Kenz , ” our Ashley said , interrupting .   
The interruption might have been rude , but the reality was that Kenzie kind of mandated them when she got going , because she pressed on and she left no gaps .
“
Yeah ?
”
“ If you get caught up in this , we ’ll spend the entire shopping trip in here , fiddling with your tech .
”
“
Oh !   
Oh , shoot , I imagined this taking twenty seconds in my head .   
How long has it been ?
”
“
Not twenty seconds , ” our Ashley replied .   
“ Come on .   
Let ’s leave them to it .   
I ’ve got to figure out what I ’m doing with my costume .
”
“
Let Sveta and I hit one or two stores , ” I said .   
“
We ’ll loop over and catch up with you ?   
If there ’s anything you want a Victoria opinion on , have them hold it at the counter
and we ’ll go back .
”
“
Do they do that ?
”
“
That is a thing they should be willing to do , yes , ” I said .   
Not much retail experience .
“
You can tell me how I ’m supposed to wear a costume with a dress built in , when the temperature is below freezing .
”
“
I can try , ” I said .   
I glanced at Sveta , who was now staring into the mirror .   
“ You might have to wear leggings .
”
She made a face , then looked at Kenzie .
“ I can do a thing , do n’t worry , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I ’m going to have to invest in better battery packs though .   
Speaking of-
”
She fished in her bag , then came out with a satchel .   
It was barely bigger than a fanny pack , but it looked like it had a double - size brick in it .
“ Wear , or have Victoria carry it and stay close .   
It ’ll keep things charged , so you do n’t burn out at an awkward time .
”
“ I ’ll carry it .
”   
I reached out and took it .   
It had to weigh twenty pounds .
“ Bye !
”
“ Bye , Kenz , ” I said .
The door banged closed .
Sveta and I stood at our individual sinks , looking in the mirrors .
I was n’t Victoria Dallon .   
I ’d been Victoria Dallon of that Dallon family since I ’d been born .   
Famous enough to be recognized even when visiting Boston or Portland , not famous enough to be a true celebrity outside of my hometown .   
At school and during events , even in my sports , I ’d always been the daughter of superheroes .   
Things had eased up after Victoria Dallon had ‘ died’ , but even after , in hospitals and in the Patrol , I ’d still had the looks , the remarks .
In a way I ’d liked it , I ’d embraced it , but … I wore a mask to be a civilian , and I felt the lifting of a burden I had n’t realized was there .
The door opened , and a middle - aged guy entered the bathroom .   
He did n’t spare us a glance as he hurried to his stall .   
No double - check of a look for Sveta .
What I was experiencing could n’t be a tenth of what Sveta might be feeling .
She dragged her fingers along the length of her arm , and there was a slight distortion- slight enough that I might have explained it away as skin stretching on contact .   
I saw her turn her arm around , examining elbow , then craning her head around to try to get a better look at the shape of her shoulder .
In the midst of it , she seemed to get a glimpse of me , and I could see that moment where the spell broke , she did n’t recognize the person standing next to her , and then realization set in .
“
Oh , I ’m sorry , ” she said .
“
It ’s perfectly okay .
”
“ I ’ve got you holding everything .   
My coat , the bag
with- was it a battery ?   
Let me take some of that .
”
“
Here .   
Take the coat .
” She nodded .   
When she took the coat , it was to hug the mass of damp polyester    against her front , both arms wrapped around it .   
One of her hands pulled away , the wrist still holding the cloth in place , and her eyes fell on the moving fingers .   
Without the ‘ smooth’ setting , they moved like her prosthetic fingers did- a subtle difference .
“ Super minor project that does n’t matter much , she said ?
”
She bit her lip , nodding .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
I ’ve got a glimmer of that same feeling .   
And I think we should take that feeling and run with it .
”
“ Run
how ? ”
“
You and I are two completely different , unrelated people , with none of the baggage and history ,   none of the current worries , and all of the great taste .
”
“
I ’m not sure I have taste .
”
“ I think you do , ” I said .   
I reached out for her arm , and my finger touched the hard surface , while appearing to depress the skin that was being projected there .   
The tattoo was there , with bold outlines and flat colors .   
“
You ’re an artist .   
Come on .   
First stop is winter stuff .
”
She let me lead her out of the bathroom and into the mall concourse .   
Kenzie and the Ashleys were already gone , but Rain and Erin were at a kiosk where books and movie DVDs were set up on revolving stands , each of them with some candy and a drink .   
Rain seemed oblivious to us as we passed them , but Erin managed to get it after double take , before shooting us a thumbs up .   
Rain said something to Byron , who was deeper inside the kiosk .
“
You do n’t get cold , right ?
”
I asked .
“ Not as much .   
I kind of get brain freeze , but I have to be pretty cold for that .
”
“
I did n’t know that .
”
“
Yeah .   
Once I get it , I have to warm up the rest of the way to get rid of it .   
But no , cold does n’t usually bother me much .
”
“ That lets us be more flexible , then .   
Thrift store ?
”
“ I was thinking I ’d be willing to buy a nice coat if I ’m going to be wearing it outside the next few months .
”
“
We ’ll keep that in mind as an option , but , as sad as it is , a lot of people sold their extra things when money was tight , and the thrift stores are currently a gold mine .
”
“ Okay .
”
“ You seem to gravitate toward the hippie , bohemian , surfer style ?   
Flowy , cascading , loose , long , printed or patterned ?
”
“ I guess ?   
I had to pick a few things that I liked , after I got a body , I rushed my choices because I was shopping with Weld
and I did n’t want to keep him forever ,
so I just went with stuff
, half of it was stuff he liked .   
Then when I get new clothes , I get clothes that fit with what I already have .
”
“
But do you like it ?
”
“ I do .   
I ’m just worried
I ’m letting something that happened almost by accident become my style , and I do n’t know better .
”
“
I ’m sure there are lots of pieces of art where someone ’s been painting
, they make a mistake and in the process of adapting to it , they find something better .
”
“
Yeah .
”
“ We ’ll dig around .   
Try new things , see what works .
” Sveta nodded .
The collection of coats was eclectic .   
I found bomber jackets , including ones with pads at the elbows- definite no from Sveta .   
There were jackets covered in patches .
“ I kind of like that , except it ’s someone else
’s patches and story , and I do n’t like the jacket style .
”
“
And it ’s a jacket , not a coat , which you could get away with , theoretically- ”
“
Except it ’d draw attention if I did .
”
We broke apart , each of us searching different racks .   
I pulled out a long coat , with a material like suede , with shaggy fur around the collar , down the front , and around the end of the sleeves , seams standing out in relief .
There was a coat that would run ramrod straight from armpit to knee , with a tidy , neat folded collar in what might have been described as preppy if the rest of the coat was n’t so un - preppy , and a bold blue curlicue along the hem and down one sleeve .   
The fabric was blue that faded to an almost acid - wash blue - green toward the parts the curlicues were .   
There was something grunge and something fantastical about it .
Sveta had n’t picked anything out .
“
Not enthused ?
” I asked .
“
I ’m not finding anything .   
And you ’ve already found two things ?
”
I showed her .
“
Oh , wow .
”
“
Good ?   
Bad ?
”
“ Really , really good .   
I could see buying either of those and being happy .   
How did you even find it ?   
I ’m sorry , but there was n’t anything like that over here .
”
“
I ’m betting there was something , maybe you second guessed it , or you were looking for something specific , and your eye passed over it because it was n’t what you were looking for .
”
I passed her the two coats I ’d found , and I went to the rack she ’d been browsing .   
Women ’s coats , sorted by size .
It was n’t as good of a series of racks , but the sunk - cost fallacy kicked in , and I found myself pressing on .
“
Number three , ” I said .   
I pulled out a wool coat , cut like a trench coat , but with even more flare at the bottom .   
The coat was predominantly gray , but was defined by an arrangement of quilted patchwork , the dense wool coming in overlapping squares and rectangles of different , bold blues and greens , with an isolated yellow - green gradient taking up a sixth of the coat starting at one shoulder .
“
It ’s pretty out there .
”
“ It is , ” I admitted .   
“
It ’s also very you .
”
“
I like it
the most , I think , ” she said .   
She reached out , dragging fingers down the front of it .   
Prosthetic fingers , I had to remind
myself-
it was less a test of the softness of the fabric and more of a …
I could n’t be sure .   
“ I do n’t know .   
Would you wear it ?
”
“
No , ” I said .
“
Never ?
”
“ Probably not .
”
“
Okay then .
”
“
But I ’m me , ” I said .   
“
I know what I like .   
I think you would n’t feel at home in your clothes if you borrowed my wardrobe for a day .   
This suits you , I think .   
Try it on ?
”
She tried on each of the coats in turn .   
I could see the indecision , but prodding was n’t too successful in getting her to open up .
It did n’t help that she was as distracted as she was with the appearance of her arms and face .
“
We ’ll put it on hold , try another store , see what the high - end options look like , ” I said .
That got me a nod , a small smile that I could n’t read .
“ Sweaters and scarves ?
” I asked .
The nod was more enthusiastic , this time .
“
If I ’m bossing you around , you can tell me to quit it .
”
“ I like you bossing me around , ” she said .   
“
I ’m happy , even if I ca n’t seem to pick anything .
”
“
Good , ” I said .   
“
You hunt over here , I hunt over there ?
”
The hunt was easier when it came to sweaters .   
Looser
so they would be easier to pull on , or layered , often long in the body , to the point that they reached the hips or qualified as dresses .   
She found an electric blue turtleneck she liked .   
Scarves allowed for more color and patterns .
The more clothes we found , the more I could see the reticence break .   
She was smiling , less caught up in the distraction of her hands and arms , and more focused on the hunt for clothes .
The winter coat somehow remained as a sticking point .
I tried on a couple of sweaters of my own while she changed in the next booth over .
“
Ah , ” I heard her .
“ Problem ?
”
“ Not a problem .   
I ’m not sure there ’s a word for this kind of disappointment and relief .
”
“ Uh ?
”
“
Come in .
” I finished pulling off my sweater , meeting strange eyes in the mirror as I pushed the changing room door open , and visited Sveta in the next booth .
She was topless , sweater and the shirt beneath pulled free .   
The projected skin that draped over her arms , shoulders , neck , and collarbone extended down to the area that would be her cleavage .   
It stopped there , with a ‘ v’ shaped wedge of flesh that terminated between two undefined metal breasts .
“
On a level , I ’m really relieved that Kenzie did n’t give me any details here-
” she said , gesturing at that area .   
“ That would be ten kinds of concerning and weird .
”
“ Agreed .   
Based on what she said , she could have left her computer to run and collect information .
”
“ A part of me hoped , you know ?
”
Sveta asked , almost plaintive .   
“ and
that part of me is really disappointed .   
It ’s even more disappointed because there ’s no way I could ask .   
Because it ’s creepy , concerning , and weird to ask an eleven year old to search through videos to make a complete body .
She stuck a leg out , hiking up her skirt .   
The projection ended mid - thigh .
“
Come on , ” I said .   
“
Let ’s go talk where we wo n’t be overheard .
”
She nodded , gathering her things to get fully dressed again .   
We went to the cash , and Sveta bought next to everything we had picked out , the coats excepted .
Burdened with bags , we headed to the front door .   
The snow was keeping most people indoors , but in the space between the two sets of doors , it was warm and quiet .   
The air circulation was a steady thrum .
“
Can I talk to you , without the thing ?
” Sveta asked .   
“
Talking about personal stuff to a stranger
’s face feels weird .
”
I reached up , found the pin , and double - tapped it .
Taking off the mask .
Sveta , bags in one hand , kept one hand at her shirt collar , prosthetic fingers near the projected collarbone .   
She did n’t switch to her old self .
“ Feeling incomplete ?
” I asked .
“
My boyfriend is coming home as soon as things wrap up at the front lines .   
Crystal should be too .
”
“
Yeah .   
It sounds like it wrapped up , but they ’re doing cleanup , which is ominous .
”
“ Ominous , yeah .   
But they ’re coming back
and … I like him
, I love him .   
I want to make him happy , and whether it ’s cooking or , um , other things , I ca n’t seem to ever make it happen .   
He does n’t taste because everything ’s muted .   
He only really likes music , but I ca n’t sing .   
I ca n’t do the other things because I do n’t have a body .
”
“
There are things you can do for him that are n’t sensory .
”
“ I try , but there ’s something about making food for someone I love and seeing them go for seconds that would make me feel like I have something to give .   
And I want to give myself to him and have him go for seconds for that , too .
”
“
Does he feel ?
”
“ Dulled feelings .   
But even if I got past that , Vicky , I do n’t know guys .   
I can use my tendrils and squeeze hard enough to bite into the metal and deform it , but I do n’t think he ’d like that .
”
“ I would n’t do that .   
Not without communicating a lot beforehand , and during .   
Probably after .
”
“
He ’s a red - blooded guy , Vicky .   
He likes women .   
With the relationship he
and I have now
, I feel like his kid sister sometimes .
”
“ I do n’t think you ’re his kid sister , Sveta .
”
“ Are n’t I , though ?   
We ’re close
but we do n’t do anything .   
I ’m
half mad scientist and half clown when it comes to the kitchen stuff , because I ’m trying to find something that works for him , but I ’m not getting any wins there .   
He does have to help me with some things , even though I ’ve gotten more independent .
”
“
There ’s more to it than that , though , ” I said .   
I suspected it was futile , because Sveta was letting something out that she ’d bottled for a while .
“
He ’s coming back
and I ’ve seen how he gets after he has the hard missions .   
Tired , but not in a way that he lets me see , and he hinted that this was a bad one .   
What if he comes back and he has to do his part to take care of kid sister Sveta , and what if he says he ’s too tired for that ?   
He ’s given me so many good days , and I ’m not sure I ’ve ever given him one .
”
“
Not the vacation trip , hunting for your homeland ?
”
“
That was for me , though .
”
“ He seemed pleased as punch to see us reuniting at the group meeting .
”
“
Again , that ’s me .   
If I could just- if I could make something and have it taste good or new or interesting to him , then that would be happiness originating from him , his thing .   
A breakthrough for him .   
If I had a full body that I could show him , that looked right , if nothing else , maybe that could be nice for him .   
There ’s supposed to be equity
and I do n’t think I ’m holding up my end .
”
“ Sveta-
no .
”
“
No ? ”
“
Not equity .   
What you want is balance .
”
“
Same thing .
”
“
No .   
Equity , to me , feels like a transaction .   
One for me ?   
One for you .   
I give you something , you owe me something ?   
With balance , it ’s about …
I hate matching and folding socks .   
He hates cleaning the bathroom .   
So I ’ll always do the bathroom and he ’ll always have the socks folded .
”
“
Okay .   
But even there , what am I giving him ?
”
“
It could be that it ’s really , really important for him to have a friendly , loving face to come back to .   
I-
I kind of feel like
I ’m
betraying Dean by saying this , but I think one thing he taught me was that guys    tend to be more disconnected than girls .   
Girls more often have support networks , or they can use the network
they have more than guys can use their networks .   
Guys like Dean or Weld ?   
I ’m not sure they ever really have a shoulder to cry on .   
I mean literally cry .   
Except sometimes a girl they ’re close with .
”
“
Did Dean ?
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“ Only a couple of times … still feels like a betrayal , confessing that .   
Which is maybe the problem or mindset that feeds into why they can so rarely do it .
”
“ We could change the topic .
”
“
No , it ’s just that maybe that ’s what Weld needs .   
Love , trust , caring , sharing , and that intimacy that is n’t only about mashing stuff together .   
It can be about being someone ’s shoulder .
”
“ And the other stuff ?
”
“ You can only keep trying with the cooking .   
I do n’t know if I have any advice to give when it comes to bedroom stuff- ”
“
What advice would you give me if I had a real body , like this ?
”
“ Communicate , set expectations , communicate .   
The first time will be embarrassingly bad .   
If it ’s the right person , then that does n’t matter .
”
“
Yeah .   
I think he ’s the right person .
”
“ Sveta , ” I said .   
I reached out and touched her arm .   
My fingertips hit hard surface before they hit the skin that was projected .   
I gave her arm a slight waggle .   
“
We have a bit of cash flow .   
We have contacts .   
We ’re in a position that matters .   
I would n’t rule out options .   
You could pursue other options like Capricorn is .
”
“
In group , Tristan talked about how he ’s lost hope .   
I do n’t know if he ’s pursuing any more .   
We chase these bright lights that our powers give us , but in reality , Scion was just the glowy ball on the forehead of an angler fish- so much bigger and more vicious than he appeared to be , and he was strong , before .   
The problems we ’re dealing with are the same .   
Two people stuck in one body .   
One person stuck in a monstrous body .   
A bunch of powers being shared around and tossed together .   
They are n’t   small or insignificant , really .   
But they ’re nothing compared to the massive , powerful engines that are behind them .   
They ’re decoys , the pinkie toes of giants .
”
Outside , the snow was blowing harder .   
There was n’t much traffic .
I built on her statement .   
No use denying it .   
“
There were people who had good glimpses and who remembered them , after Gold Morning .   
Mountain sized , island sized .   
Maybe continent - spanning .
”
“
And they ’re like computers .   
They ’re limited but they are n’t stupid .
”
I shook my head .   
“ Not stupid , but not genius either .   
It ’s a specific kind of intelligence and focus .   
They make mistakes or miscalculate .   
There are capes who do nothing wrong who get screwed over by their power-
”
“ Ashley .   
Me .   
Chris , maybe .
”
“ And capes who , if the agent had more sense , would n’t have been allowed to operate like they did .   
Khepri .   
Though Khepri was a special case .
”
“ You know the story about Khepri ?
”
“ I heard from Amy , ” I said .
In the instant , still feeling the glow from seeing Sveta enjoy shopping earlier , and even feeling okay as I tried to talk a friend through a tough relationship snarl , I ’d let Amy ’s name slip without the snarl of negative thoughts that usually accompanied it .
They did follow after , though they did n’t take root .   
I gathered my thoughts again .   
“
They are intimidating enemies , but they are n’t perfect .   
If you want this , and I think you do , then maybe it ’s worth going down that road .
”
“
Beating our powers ?   
The agents ?
”
“
Yeah , ” I said , and my voice was quiet .   
An older man came in through the one door , entering the mall .   
The warm air rushed out , the higher pressure in between the sets of double doors serving to force the cold air out .   
When the old man was gone , the other set of doors closed behind him , I continued , “ Yeah .   
I ’m getting tired of being out of control .   
I ’m tired of being surprised .   
I ’m tired of the betrayals , big and little , from family and teammates .
”
Sveta nodded emphatically , her expression serious , lips pressed together into a line .
“ Not just being out of control , but being controlled .   
I just-
no way can I tolerate that .   
Not Valefor , not Amy , not Mama Mathers , not Kingdom Come , in your case , not Goddess .   
Before the prison attack brought things to a standstill , we were building something .   
Based on some of the emails I ’ve skimmed , we can mostly pick up where we left off .
”
“
You could talk to the team about this , ” Sveta said .   
“
You ’re bringing it up with me , first .   
Like you did with your forcefield .
” I nodded .
“
Why ?
”
“
To gauge .   
How far do you want to go with this ?   
It ’s weird , but I know what the others want by now .   
You …
I get the impression that you could find one or two key things or key answers and you could be truly happy .   
You have the second coolest boyfriend ever
, you ’re beautiful ,
you ’re artistic ,
you ’re compassionate , and you could hold your own in any team .
”
“ You might be overselling me .
”
“
But if someone could wave a magic wand and grant you one wish … you ’d be okay , would n’t you ?   
You could settle down and be happy ?
”
“
One thing ?   
There are things on the side I care about .   
Um , beyond my own issue , I care about the Case Fifty - Threes .   
I kind of want to find out where I came from .
”
“
But if you had a magic wand with one wish , those are things you could still handle , right ?   
You could donate to charities or support an organization .   
You could travel on your own , once things settled down .
”
“ I might have too much of the hero bug in me to stop altogether , ” Sveta said .   
She leaned into me , her head resting on my shoulder .
“
Good to know , then , ” I said .   
“
The reason I ask , and the reason I ’m asking you first ,
is I wanted to know how far you ’d be willing to go ?
”
“
In what way ? ” she asked .
I tried to articulate it , and then settled for shaking my head .
“
That ’s not an answer .
”
“
We left Monokeros in that alternate Earth .   
We put her in a hole she could get out of , and …
she ’s in a prison without people or exits .   
She ’ll finish off the food there
and then she ’ll have to hunt or forage .   
It ’s a stopgap , until we have another alternative .   
Except Tristan lied and said she was dead .   
He lied and said she was dead , knowing full well that if he was called out on the lie or discovered for it , we ’d lose the funding , files , and other things Mortari had promised us for our cooperation .
” Sveta nodded .
“
Do we do that again ?   
With more people ?   
Keeping in mind that it ’s a world where we do n’t have a place to send them , and building that kind of a place is so intensive a project that it might be years before we ’re there .
”
“ We did n’t start at the shallow end and work our way forward , ” Sveta said .   
“
Gimel went straight to the deep end .
”
“
Absolutely , ” I said .   
“ And
some of the worst bad guys ended up leaving for Shin .   
But there are a lot of others here .   
We have resources , we have contacts .   
How hard do we go after them ?   
How hard do we go after answers ?   
Between the cases , the systems like Rain ’s cluster or the Lady in Blue co - opting her cluster , all of that and the broken triggers … we might have to start paying attention to the elephant in the room .
”
“
The agents .
” I nodded .
“
Do I have to answer right away ?
” Sveta asked .
“
No , absolutely not ,
” I said .   
“
But in a short while we ’ll be back at the hero stuff .   
I want to have a game plan .
”
“
You had other things you wanted too .   
No secrets , no lies .
”
“ If we shift or narrow our focus , we might not be able to afford either .
” Sveta nodded .   
I saw her eyes search my face .
I raised my eyebrows .
“ I ’ll think about it .   
I might talk things over with Weld , if that ’s okay .
”
“ Okay .
”
“ Thank you for talking this out with me , ” she said .   
“ I still have , like , a hundred awkward questions about boys .   
I know
you ’re not an expert-
”
“
I had a long - term relationship .   
I ’ve earned my stripes .
”
“
Okay , but one guy , and
he was easy mode because he could read your emotions .
”
“
That ’s hard mode , Sveta .   
In a lot of ways , it ’s hard mode .   
Capes do n’t get easy mode .
”
“ Touche .
”
“
Pick on me for inexperience after you ’ve asked me a question I ca n’t answer , ” I said .   
“ Until then , let me have this bit of pride .
”
“ Okay , ” Sveta said , smiling a little .   
“
You hold onto that pride .   
It ’s mostly deserved .
”
“
Mostly ?
”
I asked , smiling .
She reached up , hesitant with the motions of her arm .   
She tapped a metal finger twice against the hairclip I wore by my temple .
“
While that girl who just left the room holds onto her pride , you , strange person , promised me that you ’d find me a coat , or that we ’d go back to get one of the other ones .
”
“ I did , ” I said .   
“
It might not be a good idea to split me into too many personalities .   
I ’ve already got enough going on .
”
“ Maybe , ” Sveta said .   
But she took my wrist and she gave me a tug .   
I did n’t fight , instead catching her at my right side with my arm around her back .   
Supporting her and half - hugging her at the same time .
Back into the mall , toward a nicer store .   
I could one hundred percent get why Sveta had wanted to shop in a place like this , to get something that lasted , and that had that extra degree of craftsmanship .   
Part of the reason I ’d had her go to the thrift store with me first , though , had been to get her in the mindset of thinking about possibilities , so she would pick something fitting to her style , even here where things were more in line with one another .
The coat she
and I ended up agreeing on as most suited for her
was n’t one I would have worn myself .   
It was a heavy coat , but worn more like a poncho , top - heavy and Cashmere .   
A good base to work off of , worn with a nice scarf or nice boots .
“
I believe my coworker told you before , our apologies , but we do not allow children in this store .
” I turned around .   
The Ashleys and Kenzie were on their way in .
“
This child is the best behaved child you ’ve ever met , ” our Ashley said .   
“
I ’m a customer , you need customers .   
Do n’t be stupid .
”
“
I ’m going to have to ask you to leave , ” the manager said .
“
It ’s okay , ” Kenzie said .   
“ If you take my bag and take my hair clip , you can talk with Ashley , and I ’ll go find Erin and the boys .
”
“
Hang close enough for us to watch out for you , ” our Ashley said .   
She was keeping an eye on Damsel , who was browsing dresses .
“
Got it , ” Kenzie said , bouncing on the spot before heading to the front of the store , hands clasped behind her back .
“
We stopped in here earlier , I found some things I liked .   
Do you want to give a final verdict ?
” our Ashley asked me .
“
Sure , ” I said .   
We passed by a shelf with thermal clothing , and I grabbed a good few packs of it .   
For wearing under the costume .   
Ostensibly my reason for being here .
There was a jacket , too , that was form - fitting and sleek enough that I was pretty sure I could wear it under my costume .
Ashley ’s selection of dresses were more for events than for casual wear , but they were good .   
A halter cocktail dress with an angry flare of white feathers at the collar , a slimmer dress that almost completely covered one leg , while leaving the other bare .   
All in whites , or white with black or gray decorative elements .
“
It ’s an aggressively crisp , put - together look .   
Are you willing and able to dress the rest of yourself up to match ?
”
“ Naturally .
”
“ Then go for it .
”
“
No condemnations ?   
No calls for more color ?
”
“ Nah , ” I said .   
“
I know what you ’re capable of .
”
“
That I could take your head clean off your shoulders if needed ?
”
“
More like I know you can live up to a style this severe .
”
“ Um , ” Sveta said .   
“
Sorry to jump in .
”
“ We forgot about your coat .   
Do you want to buy it ?
”
“ I thought about it , and I think I ’m going to go to the other store for the patchwork one .
” I smiled .
“
Do n’t be smug , ” she said .   
“
I ’m taking Kenz .
”
She took her battery pack too .   
Leaving me with the Ashleys and their battery pack , just heavy enough to be obnoxious .
I gathered up the dresses we ’d liked , and took them to the counter .   
The Ashleys were holograms , so they could n’t carry , and one of my hands was burned .
“ Only reason I ’m going to condemn someone for what they ’re wearing is if it ’s offensive or if it ’s clear
they could do better .   
The first gets the hero in me acting up-
”
“
Terrible , terrible , ” Damsel said .
“ -and the second is going to make the inner coach in me antsy .   
Nothing quite so infuriating as being witness to someone doing something just slightly wrong or a lot wrong , regularly .
”
“
I feel that way about almost everyone , doing anything , ” Ashley said .
I looked back over my shoulder , toward the store where Sveta and Kenzie had gone .   
I could see them at the counter , the dress draped over the end of it .
“
They ’re good .   
I like them , ” Ashley said .
“
Is she okay ?
” I asked .   
“ Kenzie ?
”
“
No , ” Ashley said .   
“
She ’s almost as bad as when I first met her .   
Better in some ways , but in others … ”
She did n’t finish the sentence .   
I wondered if she was expecting her twin to finish it .
“
We ’ll keep an eye out , ” I promised .
“ Please .
”
Sveta and Kenzie emerged , Sveta now wearing the jacket .   
She flickered slightly as Kenzie bolted ahead to where the Ashleys and I were .
“ Rain went to the food court , ” Kenzie said .
“
Are you surveilling Rain ?
”
Sveta asked , mock stern .
“
No .   
I saw him walk that way , ” Kenzie said .   
“
No , I ’m kidding .   
Yes , he has my tech on him
and I ’m
keeping an eye on that tech , so I know kind of where he is .   
But I ’m keeping an eye on my tech , not on him , specifically .
”
Ashley gave me a sideways look .
“
I saw that
, Ashley Swan .   
Do n’t do that .
”
I put my hand on Kenzie ’s head , wobbling it left and right before pulling her closer , so my hand was on her far shoulder , her other shoulder against my side .   
Sveta was on the other side of me , looking as pleased as punch with her coat , her other coat and bags held under her other arm .
Erin , Byron , and Rain were gathered in the empty food court .   
Some of the stalls were only just now opening or re - opening .
More distracting was the lingering decorations and setup from an event that might have happened a day ago .   
It looked like this spot had been a gathering place for one of the big anti - parahuman groups .   
They had n’t properly discarded of their signs or messaging , with much of it left stacked or leaning against a wall in the corner , along with some black trash bags .
“
Jesus , ” Byron said , as we drew closer .   
He added some Spanish words I did n’t know .   
“
That ’s a lot of stuff .
”
“ Because they ’re doing it right , ” Erin said .    
She sat on a table , her feet on the stool next to the one Rain was seated on .   
He looked a little worn out .
“ I got a few t - shirts , some other shirts , some socks and underwear , and a pair of jeans , and I thought that was a lot , ” Byron said .
“
Did you get costume
related- nevermind .   
You do n’t need thermal underwear .
”
“
Not really .   
Got a pack for Tristan .
”
“
And Rain ?
” I asked .
“
We got stuff for Rain , ” Erin said .
“ We would have got more , but we decided to take a break .
”
“
Turns out malls make me pretty ridiculously anxious , ” Rain said .   
“ Stupid .
”
“ We all have our hangups , ” Byron said .
As a group , we got ourselves sorted across two sets of tables .   
Bags were deposited in the middle section .
“
Are we keeping this light and fun , or do we talk about more serious things ?
” Sveta asked .
I kept my mouth shut .   
I was up for either , but I did n’t want to steer things too much .
“
Hard to keep it light with that hanging over our heads , ” Byron said , indicating the anti - parahuman signage .
“
Well , to be fair , they ’re right , ” Rain said .   
“
Parahumans suck .   
We do crummy things .   
There are scary ones out there .
”
“ We could talk business now , then go back to fun , if you guys think you can do that , ” Sveta suggested , almost hopeful .
“
Are we eating ?
” Kenzie asked .
“
I ’m eating right now , ” Damsel said , sitting at the furthest seat away , in our cluster of two tables .   
“ Tea and sandwiches .
”
“ If you ’re hungry , we can eat , ” I said .
“
I ’m going to go get a taco or a wrap , ” Kenzie said , heading to the place apparently dubbed ‘ Hell Taco’ .
“ Business it is , ” Byron said .   
“
I ’ll swap out to Trist , as he has more to say .   
If nobody ’s looking ?
” Nobody was .
The change was subtle , as Tristan was wearing a black coat , same as Byron .   
Tristan punched Rain lightly in one shoulder , and Rain gave him a half - hearted smile in response .
“ While the munchkin is getting her food , is there anything we need to talk about , that is n’t for her ears ?
” Tristan asked .
“
That ’s the first place your mind goes ?
” I asked .
“ I thought I ’d bring it up .   
Kenzie ’s away for a few minutes .   
Is there anything we need to work out ?
”
“ Chris is gone , she ’s bummed and not at her best , so we watch out for her
and we watch her , ” I said .
“ Succinctly put , ” Tristan said .   
“
Are you swinging by the institution at some point to check on her ?
”
“
Sure , ” I said .
“
Are we going to talk about Chris ?
” Ashley asked .
“ Hard to do until we have more information , ” I said .
“
Okay , ” Ashley said .   
“
You ’re going to have files , right ?   
From Mortari .
”
“ Not on Chris , I do n’t think .   
But yes .
”
“
Alright , ” Ashley said .   
“
Then do we warn people ?   
Have we informed the institution that was looking after him that they may need to change things around ?
”
“ If he ’s in Shin , he ’s in Shin , ” I said .   
“
And there ’s not much use warning people , except for the Wardens , and they already know .
”
“
It does n’t feel good enough , ” Ashley said .
“
You ’re bothered by this , ” Rain observed .
“
Yes .   
And I ’m bothered in a way I do n’t want to pass on to Kenzie .   
I ’m glad to be talking about this now .   
This is serious , and it ’s related to us .
”
“
It ’s a kid running off because Victoria ’s sister is his best bet to get healthy .   
He ’s no more a concern than any of the many , many prisoners that were here that just got dumped on that world , ” Tristan said .   
“
Except he ’s young and stubborn , and he ’s kind of our responsibility , as you said .
”
“
You think this ?
”
Ashley asked .   
She leaned back .   
“
This is … group consensus ?
”
“ What are you saying ?
” I asked .
“
Is it ?
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“ Shave off the serial numbers , and that ’s essentially my take .   
It ’s serious , do n’t get me wrong , but …
there ’s a lot of serious going on .   
Why ?
”
“
Your sister is powerful , ” she said .   
“
I ’m sorry to bring this up , but it ’s important .
”
“
She is , ” I said .
“
Do you think she ’s going to do something to his power ?
” Tristan asked .
Fuck .   
Ick .
“
No , ” Ashley said , clearly annoyed .
“ Go easy , Tristan , ” Sveta said .
“
No , ” Ashley said , again , louder .   
All eyes went to her .   
“
What I think , and I ’m saying this as someone who pays attention to power , authority , and leadership , I was listening as they talked at the end , before they left .   
Amy made her announcement , remember ?
”
There were some nods around the table .   
Rain murmured something to Erin , clarifying .
“
Do you remember at the end ?
” Ashley asked .   
“
She turned to him , and she asked him , ‘ Was that alright?’ or something like that .
”
“
Something like that , ” Tristan said .
I felt uncomfortable in a way that did n’t necessarily have to do with Amy ’s involvement .








“ Back !
”
Kenzie announced .   
“
Incoming , clear a space !
”
I exchanged glances with some of the others .   
Sveta .   
Ashley .   
Tristan .   
Rain .   
An unfinished , sensitive topic still hung over our heads .
“ Back with a shitload of tacos , ” Tristan observed .   
“ Brain fuel for a tinker brain ?
”
“
No , geez .   
I do n’t think I could eat all of this without exploding all over the place .   
I thought I ’d get extra and share , ” Kenzie said , as she set the tray down , lifted it up , leaving a second tray on the table , then set it down beside the empty tray .   
She began dividing stuff evenly across the two trays , taking extra care with drinks .
“
I ’m not complaining , ” Tristan said .   
“
Let me pay you back for what I eat .
”
“ You do n’t have to .   
I have a stipend , and we ’re getting some money now .
”
“
You ’re a tinker .   
You ’re probably paying for your stuff out of pocket .   
Paying you back means we ’re keeping it fair for the team .
”
“ M’kay , wo n’t complain , ” Kenzie said .   
She worked her way into the space between the two Ashleys .   
“
What are you guys talking about ?
”
I met our Ashley ’s eyes .   
She nodded just a fraction .
This would n’t be easy .
“ Chris , ” I said .
“
Oh , ” Kenzie said .   
I could see her register that-
no hurt on her expression , only a quirk of an eyebrow .   
She flashed a smile at me , before lifting her taco with its hard , blood - red shell to her mouth , taking a big enough bite that her expression was unreadable .
It might have been fascinating if it had n’t sucked so much to see .
“ We ’re going straight to that ?
”
Tristan asked me .
Kenzie held up a hand until she ’d finished chewing and swallowing .   
“ To what ?   
Chris ?   
Why not ?   
Because I ’m here ?
”
“
Here ’s the deal about us talking about it when you ’re not here , Kenz , ” I said .   
“ We do n’t want to leave you out , and I want to minimize the secrets we ’re keeping , but this is tricky .   
So we touch base with each other .   
We ask each other how best to do this kind of thing .
”
“ Uh huh , ” she said .   
She took another bite , turning her head sideways .   
Before biting , she said , “ I got you iced tea , by the way .   
I dented the lid .
”
Deflection after deflection .   
The bite of food , pointing out the iced tea .   
Would Sveta register that Kenzie was off ?   
Would Rain ?   
Tristan ?   
Erin ?
I leaned over .   
Out of the drinks she ’d balanced across the tray , the plastic lids had little buttons that could be depressed to show what type of drink it was .   
I grabbed the iced tea and did n’t think too hard about how Kenzie might know it was my go - to drink .   
I ’d think on it later .
“
We checked with each other before bringing it up .   
Just like you guys probably talked about how you wanted to keep Amy ’s involvement with Goddess a secret at first , because it would have been awkward and unnecessary .
” Kenzie nodded .
“
That was fine for me .   
We wanted to figure out if it was fine for you .   
It needs to be talked about .   
Is that okay ? ”
“
Yeah , ” she said .   
“
Got ta talk about it .   
One hundred percent .   
So long as we ’re fair .   
I know he did something weird and betray -
y the other night , but I think he would have had to have good reasons .
”
“
He ’s always kept things close to the chest , ” I said .
“
He had a lot of secrets , ” Tristan said .   
“
But when someone like him tells you who they are , believe them .   
He told us what motivated him .   
He wanted to dive head - first into the intense , powerful cape stuff .   
He was grumpy about being left out of the visit to the W.H.Q. , and he was perfectly happy to be in the midst of the Fallen thing .   
Now he ’s maneuvered to be in the midst of the Earth - Shin thing .
”
“ I do n’t like that interpretation , ” Kenzie said .
“ Why not ?   
It ’s fair , ” Tristan asked .
“
Because it makes it seem like he schemed his way through it all .   
Is n’t it better to give him the benefit of a doubt and be wrong , than to not and be one hundred percent worse than we could pretend he is ?
”
“ Honestly , I like giving him the benefit of a doubt , ” Rain said .   
“
I know how shitty it can be to not get it .
”
“
I ’m not painting him as the bad guy here , ” Tristan said .   
“
Okay ?   
There ’s no need for doubts or benefits of the doubt .   
I ’m
laying out basic facts .   
This is what he always wanted , and this is what he was open about , and it ’s what he ended up doing , apparently .   
Going to where the powers are .
”
“
The reason I do n’t like it is that if you put it that way , it sounds like we were only a means to an end , and I refuse to believe that .
”
“ That-
” Tristan started .   
I moved my hand , indicating for him to stop .
“
Let ’s take five , ” I said .
“
Sure .   
Sorry Kenz .
”
“
It ’s fine , ” Kenzie said , with a shrug .
I ’d been able to see Tristan starting to get riled up for a debate .   
I ’d seen it a couple of times before , and my gut feeling was that when it came to facts against feelings , and the facts came from someone as convicted and die - hard as Tristan , the feelings from , well , Kenzie ?   
There was no way it would end well .
Others were taking food from the tray .   
I waited until people had made their choices , then took a wrap .
Erin and Rain ducked out , heading to one of the other vendors .   
A burger place had just opened for lunch .   
‘ Patty ’s Patties’ .   
That took me back
– if I had to go back to earliest memories , then fuck , one of my five or ten earliest memories of Amy was from a family trip – would have had to have been , since the franchise was n’t in Brockton Bay .   
She had been outright weeping because she ’d been so bothered by the decorations around Patty
’s –
whole herds of tiny cartoon cows marching off assembly - line style through the process of getting carved up and served , then dining on burgers .
Sure enough , the cartoon design had been updated to something more clean around the edges , but right beside the store ’s sign was a cartoon cow with knife and fork , disembodied upper body floating over the pelvis and legs , a slice cleanly removed from its middle .   
Because of the design , it had no expression , only vertical lines for eyes and two circles inside an oval for the nose .
Of all the things to survive the end of the world .
Rain ventured partway back , with Erin hanging closer to the counter .   
Order put in , and he was close enough to listen in while waiting .
Kenzie took another bite of her food then sniffled once , before reaching for a napkin .   
She dabbed at the corner of one eye , then wiped at her nose .
“ Kenz , ” Sveta said .   
“
You okay ?
”
“
This taco is really , really spicy .   
I had no idea , ” Kenzie said , her voice distorted by the spice .   
She made a small cough , then thumped her fist down on the table .
“
It really is , ” Tristan said .
Reconciliation ?   
Middle ground by way of hell tacos ?
“ I was worried you were really upset , ” Sveta told Kenzie .
“ I do n’t get weepy , ” Kenzie said .   
“ I am slightly annoyed .   
Chris had a hard time with people , but he showed he cared in other ways .   
He cared about my stuff , he listened to me blab on about my work when others would run away .   
He always was up - front about calling things out the way he saw them .   
That ’s how he cared .   
Even when things got nasty , he ’d usually step in and pull it back to say something nice after taking it too far .   
He would n’t do that if he did n’t care .
”
“
I do n’t think that ’s true , ” Damsel - Ashley said .
“
Do n’t you start .   
You did n’t even know him , ” Kenzie said , jabbing her partially - eaten taco at the projected Ashley to her left .   
“
When he was nice he was so nice .   
So clever and thoughtful .   
There was something in there , that he had to keep protected and secret .
”
“
She ’s not wrong .   
I ’ve told you that you have to watch out for people like that , ” our Ashley said .   
“ When someone treats you badly nine times out of ten , and treat you really nice the rest of the time , that means they ’re bad for you .   
It ’s easy to fake being nice the one time out of ten .
”
“
He was n’t nice only one time out of ten , okay ?   
Please and thank you ,
” Kenzie said .   
“
He was the first friend I ever made that was close to my own age , who stayed with me more than a couple of weeks .   
He listened to me geek out and watched stuff or read stuff because I mentioned it .   
He ’s one of only a couple of people I ever knew who understood what it was like to be one hundred percent lonely .
”
“ One hundred percent lonely ?
” Sveta asked .   
“ I think    a lot of people have experienced that .
”
“
I do n’t know exactly how to put it .   
A bunch of people here probably get it , or they got a taste of it , ” Kenzie said .   
“
You do n’t get powers unless you do n’t have anyone to turn to , or something ?   
But there ’s a difference between being totally alone the once and being totally , one hundred percent alone because that ’s the way things are , or it ’s the way you are , and it ’s a pattern .   
And because it ’s a pattern you ’ll probably be this alone again in five years or ten years .   
It ’s a loneliness that ’s lonelier because there ’s no way it can get better .
”
“ I think you ’d be surprised how others relate to that , ” Sveta said .
“ I guess so , ” Kenzie said .   
“
I have n’t thought that much about it .
”
“
I hope you know that pattern ended here , ” our Ashley said .   
“
I ’m with you .
”
“
Except you    promised me that
and you went to jail , ” Kenzie said .   
She stopped herself , then smiled at Ashley .   
“
Sorry to say it like that .   
You did stay in touch but you did go to jail too .
”
I saw Ashley digest that , then nod .
“
Um .   
Anyway , that pattern ?   
There ’s more to it .   
Chris gets it , I think .   
He welcomes it , encourages it .   
We ’re different because I do n’t want it , but he and I have that common ground .   
We ’ve both nosedived into big projects that you can only really do if you do n’t do anything else , and we can talk about those things .   
That was a me and him thing .
”
“ Hobbies ?
” Rain asked .
“ ‘ Hobbies’ feels like too much a group thing .   
Anyway , I was talking with him about it not all that long ago , especially over the summer when there was n’t school , and I remember thinking it would be so nice to do that for a long time .   
It made so much sense because we had that common ground , right ?   
I kind of fell in love with that idea
and I fell in love with him at the same time .   
Not regular love , it was a bit different this time .   
Maybe crush - love .
”
Ah .   
So that was what she ’d been getting at .
“
Aw , hon , ” Erin said .   
She ’d returned a minute ago , and I had n’t noticed .
“
He said no , by the way , ” Kenzie added .   
“
He said we ’d never get along and he ’s right .
”
“
Can I squeeze in there ?
”
I asked Damsel .
She stepped back from the table .   
I slid across , and took the seat beside Kenzie , putting my arm around her .   
She leaned into me hard .
“
There ’s a possibility he needs help , ” I said .   
“
I know you guys got the basics from him in group .   
Normally we ’d want him to share it on his own , as he feels free , but he obviously ca n’t do that now .   
I do n’t know his background , but I think we need to make sure we all have the information .
”
“ You want his story ?
” Tristan asked .   
He leaned back into the cheap food - court seat .
“ Please .
”
All around us , the seats were empty .   
The only people were way off to either side , in the spaces where lines would form , walking to the food stalls , where skeleton crews were working .
“ I guess since I ’m one of the people who knew him best , I ’ll cover this ?
”
Rain asked .
Tristan shook his head .   
“
It ’s tricky .   
He ’s dropped contradicting details .   
I think when he did tell us stuff , he changed particulars around .   
Keep in mind there might be some misleading details in this .
”
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .   
“
Something like that .   
I think to hide particulars about the people he had to kill on the way .
”
“ Multiple people ?
” I asked .
“
His first memory , the way he explained it in group , is that he was changing back from one of his other forms .   
It was a dangerous form , and a third party was reactivating him .
”
“
Reactivating him ?
”
“
Yeah .   
Keeping him in a loop of changing into a senseless , dangerous form , letting it start to lapse , and then getting him back in that form by giving him a new target or something before he had his senses again .   
For a while .   
A while .
”
“
Why ?
”
“
This is where we have to read between the lines , ” Rain said .   
“
He does really interesting things with biology , and apparently it ’s things that outside parties can use .   
He creates extra mass and stores it elsewhere , he has tissues that heal quickly , he has natural weapons , and he can have materials in his biology that are as durable as a steel alloy .   
He dropped a hint once .   
That it was a tinker that sold him or rented him out so others could study his power , or a tinker enclave that kept it all in - house .   
I do n’t know .
”
“
He talked about brain scans , ” Tristan said .   
“
Also the feeding- the forced reactivation I mentioned before .
”
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .   
“
The initial change or manifestation of powers-
I wo n’t call it triggering because I do n’t think he remembers triggering , it broke his brain .   
He does n’t have much in the way of old memories .   
He might have tried to survive on his own for a bit , but he got caught and used by third parties .
”
“ He never fully recovered ?
” I asked .
“
Nah , ” Rain said .   
“
But he was working on it .
”
“
There was a girl from my hometown who got caught and used for her power .   
I missed the chance to be there when she got out , and I never got to talk to her , ”
I said .   
“
I hope she ended up
okay .
”
“
It might be happening a lot more than we imagine , ” Tristan said .   
“ Resources are scarce , the wealth divide is pretty nuts .   
Some people got lucky , like Byron and me , we had stuff from back home we were able to salvage and sell in lots , and a lot of that got spent on , uh , insurance .   
Most others started on the ground floor , wealth reset to zero , and people like some of these monsters out there , they hate being on an even playing field .   
They ’d prey on others if it meant an advantage .
”
I took a bite of my neglected wrap , thinking .
“
Does he want revenge ?
” our Ashley asked .
“
He never gave me that impression , ” Rain said .
Tristan drummed his fingers on the table .   
“
We should keep an eye and an ear out for creeps like that .   
The kind of people who would traffic in changers for their power , catch tinkers like that girl from your town , Victoria .
”
“
She was a thinker , but
yeah .
”
“
Yeah , ” he said .   
“
Maybe we can get some answers in retrospect .   
Figure out how to deal with him if we cross paths again .   
Give him some peace of mind , if it ’s eating at him , or get a better idea of who he is and where he came from .
”
“ Seems risky to pick up prisoners like that , ” Sveta said .   
“
Prisoners trigger or second trigger .   
Or escape .   
Chris escaped .
”
“
Yeah , ” Tristan said .   
“
Thing is , money ?   
If you have it , it ’s easier to make it .   
If you have more of it than most people , then your money will grow faster than most people ’s .   
Right ?
”
“
Meaning that if we wanted to keep an eye out for people who might know what happened , we might keep an eye out for people with money , ” Sveta said .   
“ Or a lot of resources .   
Like Mortari .
”
Jeanne Wynn and her assistant .   
Citrine and the Number Man .
“ Or
Teacher , ” I added .
“
Which kind of dovetails into what we were talking about before , ” Sveta said .   
“ If-
is that okay to bring up ?
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
Let ’s minimize the secrets .
People were paying attention , finishing off their meals if they ’d been doing a lion ’s share of the talking , as Kenzie and Tristan had , or picking at their fries and sides , if they ’d been mostly quiet .
“
Let ’s talk about shifting gears , ” I said .
“
Shifting gears how ?
” Rain asked .
⊙ Foresight .   
Shepherds .   
Advance Guard .   
The three biggest teams that acted as teams .   
The Wardens might have counted , but the Wardens were n’t present , and I was n’t sure they were a team by definition .
There were smaller teams too .   
The Major Malfunctions .   
The Lone Wolf Pack .   
Paint Fumes .   
Super Magic Dream Parade .   
The Keepers of Peace .   
Green and Bear
It .   
The Homonculus Three .   
The High Road .   
The Fifth Brigade .
This had started out with just a discussion with Foresight .   
We ’d cooperated the most in the past .   
They ’d been there when Amy had left with the prison population .
From there , it had been a question of selling things to the Shepherds , led by Moonsong , who had her doubts about Tristan , and to Advance Guard , who had their doubts about me .
Once we had the big teams on board , it had been a question of figuring out who would accept , and who would refuse .   
The Major Malfunctions were easy .   
Eager , looking to help .   
Others ?
Others were scared .
These guys , who were approaching to stand in front of me and the rest of Breakthrough , looked scared .
The leader was hardest to read , because his bodysuit was skintight , capped off with a helmet that hugged his head , an opaque black visor covering his face .   
The decoration was also the wiring that connected his nervous system to the enormous portal that he wore on his back , the size of a pair of motorcycles .   
It was only by the device ’s hovering capability that he was able to venture indoors with it , though the pack    did scrape up against the sides of any door he passed through .   
A young teammate of his had a tall , musclebound brute projection around and above her , carrying the weapon that went with the portal .   
The third member of the group wore a bodysuit that was so heavily decorated that the theme was lost in the jumble , all whites , reds , blues , and oranges , with some revolving segments .   
The mask looked like a door knocker , complete with a heavy metal ring .
“
This is ominous , ” Accession said .   
The machine at his back whirred , as if reacting to his emotions .
I held out the pamphlet we ’d put together .   
One for every team .
“
You ’re a mercenary group , ” I said .   
“ Heroes for hire .   
You take bids for the most pressing jobs and you do your best to achieve them .   
If you fail , you refund .   
Right ?
”
“
Right .   
We have a pretty decent track record , considering the difficulty of some of these jobs .
”
“ I would like to improve that track record , ” I said .   
“
You ’re a tinker , right ?   
You did n’t get the tech from someone else ?   
I know some tinkers do that to stay out of trouble .
”
“
It ’s my tech .
”
“ Page seven , ” I said .
The representative members of the other teams were all gathered , listening and waiting .
“ Tinker notes , ” Accesssion said .   
He twisted around to show his teammates .
“ Does n’t mean anything to me , ” Mamori said .
“
It ’s nice , ” Accession said .   
“
But you would n’t have everyone here if you wanted to trade tinker work .
”
“ If you think that ’s something you can use , you can have it , courtesy of Lookout here .   
You can also have a turn at looking at the tinkertech of every person here .   
If you get on board , agree to some rules , you can get an edge .
”
“ We make okay money .   
This is stuff I can buy , ” Accession said .   
“
I can get it without selling my soul .
”
“ No soul required , ” I said .   
“
Only cooperation and information .   
We ’ve already set up an infrastructure , some loose jurisdictions .   
We ’ve grouped teams by who they ’re willing to work with and the ground rules they ’re willing to follow .   
If you ’re violent vigilantes , fine .   
So long as you ’re working for the good guys .   
We ’ll pair you with the other violent ones and we ’ll leave you to it as long as you are n’t crossing any critical lines .
”
“
We ’re not violent , ” Accession said .
“
No .   
But if you ’re willing to shoulder your share of the city , we ’ll pair you up with people you can get along with .
”
“
Other mercenaries ?
”
“
No .   
Mercenaries are competition , ” Tristan spoke up .   
“ Volunteers .   
Selfless guy heroes who are willing to lend their help to ensure a job is completed all the way .
”
I glanced at Withdrawal , who was standing off to one side , glowing teal tonight , not pink .   
He ’d welcome the chance to get some experience , to help out good guys .   
Hopefully we could get him contacts .
“
What ’s the catch ?
” Accession asked .
“
If you arrest any of the massive scumbags ?   
Anyone on our lists ?   
Let us interrogate and disappear them .
”
“ Disappear ?
”
“ One of our teams has the means of imprisoning them indefinitely .   
Reasonably safe , reasonably humane .   
But we ’re not sharing .   
The more people know , the more they can figure out how to break ’em out or try to capture them like they did with the parahuman prison outside of Greenwich .
”
“
That ’s it ?
”
“
We also require information , ” Swansong said .   
She raised her chin a fraction .   
She was alone- Damsel was back at the apartment .   
The lingering influence from her other half still seemed pretty darn apparent .   
There was more of the imperiousness I ’d seen in our initial interactions .
I added my voice to hers .   
“
We ’re reconstructing old case files and databases .   
We ’ll need something at regular intervals .   
It can be old information on current threats , it can be secondhand information , bought from others here and contributed with your own hand .   
You will have access to these files and databases .
”
Swansong added , “ You will briefly lose access and other benefits of signing if you provide incorrect information .   
You ’ll permanently lose access and benefits if you provide misinformation .
”
She was good at sounding intimidating , at least .   
I ’d have had to use my aura to achieve the same effect .
“
Can we look this over ?
”
Accession asked .   
“
Talk it over as a team , discuss with our manager ?
”
“ That would be a good idea , ” I said .
⊙ The floor of our headquarters had a Capricorn - created pad of flat ground near the door .   
From my altercation with Amy .   
The building felt smaller than it once had , and I was n’t sure if it was because she had been here , instilling a claustrophobic effect .
We ’d reached out to every team that would listen .   
We ’d used the teams that had been willing or interested to get others to the table .   
Hours of meetings , of handing over packages where rules and tech were outlined .   
Erin had been in the back with Rain , printing out and binding the next pamphlet so it would be ready for the next people to come in .
Formalizing deals we ’d made in abstract before .
It was done .   
We were tired , and some of us still had our shopping with us from earlier in the day .   
Others , myself included , had been weathering the initial storm , re - forging connections .
“
There ’s not much I can do with my stuff broken , ” Lookout said .   
She undid clasps on her helmet and pulled it
off-
the helmet itself had been re - styled , doing away with the buns .   
Even with more allowance in the helmet ’s shape to let her hair hang free , it now stuck to her face and scalp with sweat .
“
Whatever you can do is great ,
” I said .
Sveta looked anxious as she passed me , making her way to her station where her things were .
“
And I should get back to the institution before it ’s too late .   
They might not care much where I am ,
but- ” “ Curfew , ” I said .
“ You know , I ’d be safer at my old place .   
I have surveillance over there .   
I ’d just need to find some conventional weapons I could hook up to that surveillance .
”
“ I think that sounds like a dangerous way to deal with more home intruders .   
For now , let ’s just endure .   
Let ’s get online , make sure we have the sites up so people can contribute info .
”
“ We do n’t have the crazy power outages we were having before , ” Rain said .
Tristan was taking off his armor .   
“
It could be because the Wardens are coming home .   
That means Weld and Crystal .
”
The computers were booting .   
One cube was by the desk , but the other was back in Kenzie ’s old workshop , at her parent ’s house .   
The cube lit up and began humming .
There was a clatter as Rain moved a box of his spare parts .   
Traps , blades , mechanisms and housings for his arms .
We were home again .
“
Connecting , ” Kenzie said .
The laptops were booted , the screens online .   
Without the projector system in action , we were limited to the real , actual screens .
“
Overlaying to satellite image of the area .
”
On the largest screen , a map appeared , just large enough to have the New York district in its bottom left and Brockton Bay in the top right .   
Icons with their own abbreviations worked into them were scattered across the city , many flowing from the same general point .
“
Good for now , but before we stumble onto anything too sensitive , we need to put the unwritten rules protocol in place .
”
“ I ca n’t promise it ’s going to work perfectly , ” Kenzie protested .
“
It ’s okay .
”
She hit a key , and the screen went dark .
We ’d brought Foresight on first .   
Foresight had thinkers , and their thinkers could read people for trouble .   
We ’d scanned all of the heroes coming in , and we , through tags on the pamphlets and tags surreptitiously placed on people , had established a way to track movements for the next few hours .
The screen slowly illuminated again .   
The map was back , but the moving dots and labels were gone .
“
We should get you back for curfew , ” I said .   
“
Can we leave the computers running and come back to this in the morning ?
”
“
I might stay , ” Sveta said .   
“
You ’re coming back , right ?
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .
“ We ’ll hang out , get sorted .
”
“
Sure , ” I said .   
I smiled .
“
Aw , I want a sleepover .
”
“ There wo n’t be any sleeping here , Kenz , ” I told her .
She sighed .
She was still mock - pouting a bit a minute later when her hand went up , finger pointing at one of her screens .
One circle with initials was back on the screen .   
It flashed periodically to draw attention .
Accession , or one of his subordinates .
Kenzie hurried to the computer keyboard , and began hitting keys .
The images that came back were blurry , monochrome .   
Taken from discreet omnidirectional cameras in the notebooks .
“
This one was flagged for us because the camera recognized money , ” Kenzie said .   
She tapped the screen .
Accession .   
He was meeting with someone .   
Young , female , with a coat worn over a bodysuit , a mask on her face that blurred the shadows around eye socket and brow into a singular black blob .   
The cash sat on a table , the face of the bills barely visible , obscured by the pale band that encircled each bundle .
“
They ’re mercenaries , ” Tristan said .   
“ Cash is the norm .
”
“
Yeah , but if you ’re a heroic mercenary , you do n’t get paid in bricks of cash ,
” I said .   
“
You crowdfund or you get paid by legitimate channels .
”
I knew the silhouette pretty well .
“
Besides .   
Look at that person there .   
We know her .
”
People turned their heads , striving to get a better view of a two - tone picture .
“
We wanted to traffic in information .   
Were we baiting her ?
”
Rain asked .
“
No , not really , ” I said .   
“
Where is she having this meeting ?
”
“
In the city , ” Kenzie said .   
“ Coffee shop .
”
“
No sound ?
”
She shook her head .
“ Tattletale ’s in play , ” I announced , for those who had n’t seen or recognized the blurry face yet .   
“ Always has to make the hard things harder , does n’t she ?
”
Kenzie hit other keys , moving around the snapshot to see different angles and mark light and shadow .   
Breakthrough was gathered , shoulder to shoulder , leaning toward the screen .
“
Nothing else that ’s useful , ” Kenzie said .   
“ That blur might be Chicken Little .
”
“ You ca n’t enhance - enhance - enhance ?
”
Rain asked .
Kenzie shook her head .   
“
My tech is n’t all that right now .
” We broke away .   
I saw one or two people rubbing their hands together and blowing on them .   
It was an issue with the rushed constructions , that so many lacked good insulation .   
The snow was coming down outside , and the snow would insulate some , if I remembered right , but I was pretty sure it would have to be a lot of snow .
We ’ll have to buy heaters , I thought .   
I wonder if Tattletale is comfortable where she is , or if there ’s a reason she ’s this far from home .
“ I can take more pictures , but it ’s going to burn out the tracker by the third or fourth , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Also , it might cause radios or walkie - talkies to sneeze .
”
“
Sneezing is a funny way of putting it , ” Rain said .   
“ If we ’re laying low and keeping an eye on things from here until we ’re needed , I need a project .   
You ’re okay , Ash ?
”
“
I ’m fine , ” Ashley said .   
“
No sparks , no twitches , the fingers move like they should .
”
“ Sveta ?
”
“
Oh .   
The tentacles ?
”
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .   
“
Do you want something similar ?   
I can adapt .   
Obviously , I ’m limited .
”
I was silent , watching the monitors .   
One with the map , the single blinking icon , moving slowly across the map .   
Another with the two - tone snapshot of Tattletale meeting Accession .
“
Not tentacles , ” Sveta told Rain .   
“
What about … something more human ?
”
“ I might have ideas .   
They ’re going to have to wait .   
The powers are rolling out randomly , ebb and flow , and Cradle got most of them last night .   
I ’m working with baseline Rain tinkertech .
”
“
I ’m not in a rush , ” Sveta said .
“ I ’ll come up with something .   
For now I ’m going to work on arms for myself , but I have n’t forgotten .
”
“
It ’s okay , whatever you do ,
I ’m fine .   
I ’m grateful .
”
I watched as the dot continued moving .   
Faster this time .   
Car ?
Dog ?
“
Let ’s wait and see where she stops , ” I decided .
Kenzie was packed up .   
The others were settling down , breaking into the weeks - old snacks we ’d stockpiled , and unwinding from the day .
Erin was keeping to the background , but when she was n’t staying quiet while we conducted team business , I could see how animated she was , and how she smiled .   
I could see , too , how Rain was almost revitalized .   
He had courage now , opinions , almost a new man .   
Some of that ‘ new man’ veered into jumping to assumptions about what Sveta would want , but that was manageable .
I could see it in Ashley , with her clothes obtained .   
Her hands were working .   
She was free .   
There remained a question about what would happen in the future , but for now , things were good there .
It was Kenzie that was hurting .   
Sveta needed help .
I ’d come here to be a coach
and I wanted to guide .   
I ’d come to help the city
and I wanted to do that .   
To pull things together .
As I kept an eye on the others , I kept an eye on the icon .   
I saw it stop , and I saw it remain stopped for several minutes .
“
One more snapshot , while she still has the pamphlet , ” I said .   
“
Then we take you back to your place , Kenz .
”
One more snapshot .   
She hit the key .
It was Chicken Little , face close to the camera , making a silly face directly at the lens , cheeks sucked in between teeth , lips puckered .
“
Of course , ” Tristan said .   
“
Of course .
”
She was on to us already ?
“
Come on , ” I said , biting back my disappointment .   
I ’d hoped to have a slight edge in this .   
“
Let ’s get you to bed , Kenz .
”
She did n’t budge from her seat .   
She reached out , and she hit the arrow keys .
Slowly , the view panned .   
It was an omni - directional image , and the image could turn away from Chicken Little ’s face .
“
Do we know what ’s at that address ?
” Sveta asked .
Kenzie kept the key held down while navigating with her mouse .   
“ Hotel .
”
Hotel .
The camera panned .   
Chicken Little was n’t the only kid there .   
There were others .   
Younger girls and boys , most with dark , curly hair .   
All with masks and costumes .
Bags .
And finally , her back partially turned , Tattletale talking to another woman , who might have been Bitch or might have been Foil- only a sliver of the woman was visible .
“
She brought troops , ” Tristan said .
“
Heartbroken , ” I said .   
“ And luggage .   
They ’ve left the New Brockton area .
”
“ Were they driven out ?
” I had trouble imagining another reason for them to be gone .   
New Brockton was their territory .   
They ’d put everything into it for years and now they ’d left it ?   
What had happened there , or what was happening here that was pulling them together ?








I had been trying to build connections for weeks now .    
It had started at Hollow Point , inviting teams to come in , putting ideas like taking credit second to letting other people have their share of the glory .   
We had shared and asked for favors , and that we had asked was n’t that bad a thing , because people tended to like helping , and they felt stronger in knowing they could call in a chit and have some extra powers on their sides .
We ’d put our necks on the line for the Fallen fight .   
Some ups , some downs .   
We had earned some nods by getting ahead of the portal thing and keeping it from being quite as bad as it would have otherwise been .   
We ’d done the neck - to - line thing again by going on television .   
Then the prison .
None of it had gone perfectly .   
Three team members lost along the way , two partially recovered .   
Raised eyebrows and questions about the television program .   
Others had questions about the prison thing , but they were n’t going so far as to ask   those questions and we were n’t offering details .
Now ?   
Consolidation .   
Reinforcing our team ’s ties to one another was only one part of the consolidation .   
Reaching out to other teams and doing something more formal with our relationships to them was the other half of it .
I stood in the center of the open floor of our headquarters , surrounded by whiteboards that were littered with notes and personal details .   
My arms were folded , my still - burned and bandaged hand resting against my bicep , where the bullet had passed through .   
My costume top was in the laundry , so I only wore a sleeveless black undershirt with my costume bottoms .
My eyes were on a projected screen on the wall .   
Most projector images did n’t really have black as a thing , which meant they did n’t work so well in areas with lots of windows or light .   
Kenzie ’s cameras projected black , making the text distinct .
Three names , white text on the black background : ‘ Mapwright ( AG)’ , ‘ Gong ( AG)’ , and ‘ Bullhorn ( IV)’ .
Chris ’s old whiteboard was in the back corner , furthest from Kenzie ’s workstation , across from the bathroom and by the technical front door of the headquarters that we never used , because we always came and went from the fire escape , if we were n’t using the building ’s laundry unit or heading into the basement to flip the breakers if Kenzie did n’t stagger out the startup processes of her tech enough .   
It was n’t Chris’ whiteboard anymore .   
Byron had taken it over .
Icons blinked on the screen .   
I could have gone to the computer and used the mouse to click one , or tried my hand at the voice recognition program and asked the computer nicely .   
One icon to bring up a map and show where in the city this was happening .   
Another to bring up pertinent details on each of the people – many ‘ details’ were blank , filling in only as fast as people found time to spare .   
There would still be some misinformation .
I left it alone , my attention split three ways , between looking around the headquarters , watching the unchanging text on the screen , and hoping .   
It was nine in the morning , hardly prime time for villainy .
The text on the screen changed , so quickly it almost tricked my eyes .   
Two new lines .   
‘ Assist : Withdrawal ( MjMf)’ , ‘ Assist : Finale ( MjMf)’ . “
Hey guys , ” I whispered the words .   
I was alone in the headquarters , but saying it at full volume felt like it would have been an entirely different thing .
I had n’t expected them .   
I had n’t known if anyone at all would show up , but them least of all .
In a way , I almost felt like the Major Malfunctions wanted what I wanted more than anyone else .   
Breakthrough had their own diverse needs and wants .   
They had since the beginning .   
My parents and my mom in particular ?   
Way off in left field there .   
The big teams had their ideological divides , with strong views on how everything should be handled , not just the cape stuff .   
Most of the little teams had their own individual focuses .
The Major Malfunctions wanted to help .   
They wanted to work with others .   
They wanted to get up to speed .   
That they were involved made just about every emotion I was feeling go up two notches on the dials .   
My hands gripped my upper arms .
“
Come on , ” I whispered .
Again , the screen change .   
I ’d been staring at it for so long
that the text lingered in my vision after the point it had disappeared .
Two man Advance Guard patrol against independent villain
Bullhorn , Major Malfunctions assisting for goodwill .   
Capture and arrest , custody pending .
I punched the air .   
“
Yes !
”
Two weeks of lead - in for this .   
The fight had n’t been a hard one .   
Gong might have been able to handle it on his own .   
Advance Guard might have intentionally gone out early to pick a fight they knew they could win , which skewed the results .
We ’d told other teams that we ’d have our system online this morning , and Kenzie had set it up to go online at ten .   
Advance Guard had multiple members out on patrol at the time the imaginary starting pistol had fired .
That was just who they were .
But it was a win .   
So long as I did n’t look too much into it , investigating the particulars of the fight , how the public tied into it , whether there was property damage , it was a clean , cooperative , perfect win .
I would , of course .   
I ’d get the details further down the line .   
This was an experiment , and it would be for nothing if I closed my eyes to everything that took away from my desired result .
I flew across the room to make a note on my whiteboard , because I would ’ve been risking a Kenzie - like happy skip or bouncy walk if I was using my feet to travel .
Already , another Advance Guard team was reporting to the network that they were entering an area with known villains .   
Spright and Flapper against Eclipse Arc .
To them , being first and being on top were things that mattered .   
I was n’t going to complain .
My skin prickled with goosebumps as the door to the fire escape opened , cold air flooding the space .   
Alternate - identity Rain and Tristan .   
They both set to kicking snow from their boots and shoes , respectively .
“
Did I miss the start ?
” Tristan asked .   
“
Did we win ?
”
To him , being first and being on top were things that mattered .   
I smiled .
“
You missed it , and we won .   
Advance Guard , Majors assisting .   
Bullhorn .
”
“
That sounds one - sided , ” Rain said .
“
That ’s part of the idea , ” I said , turning to look at the screen .   
Spright and Flapper had already retreated from the scene .   
They were putting out a call for assistance .   
If they had n’t been way out on the end of the city closer to Brockton Bay , I might have flown out .
I went to my computer and opened the page , adding in details on the fly because it looked like people were looking up the particulars .   
Eclipse Arc were serious , as villains went .   
Good costumes , good powers .   
There were ‘ heroes’ out there who got themselves labeled Vigilantes because they crossed lines or shrugged off law and convention in their pursuit of the bad guys .   
Eclipse Arc were the opposite , a pair of villains walking a ‘ Robin Hood’
line where they really only preyed on those who deserved it .   
They supported convention rather than flouting it , tending to go after villains where possible , and among those villains , going after those that had broken the unwritten rules first .
They were big time enough to warrant being a serious target of heroes , but by walking the line they did , they made it very easy for others to gloss over them or leave them alone in favor of other targets .   
Too big for Prancer ’s old group of B - list villains , too small to be important .   
Too villainous to be worth reaching out to , too noble to be a target people could feel especially good about dealing with .
Except the unwritten rules had broken down and Eclipse Arc were out being assholes , robbing people who did n’t deserve it .   
Hopefully Advance Guard would steer them back onto their old path .
“
Are you going ?
” Tristan asked .
“ They ’re closer to Boston .   
No .   
The fight will be over before I was out the door .
”
Rain walked up until he was beside me , double - tapping and removing the necklace that powered his identity , and setting the backpack with its heavy battery onto the table by the door as the second ‘ skin’ fell away .   
Now his ordinary scruffy self , he ran fingers through his snow - damp hair .   
Odd , to see him with no visible scrapes or scuffs , no lines under his eyes .   
He looked simultaneously younger and older .   
He also , I noted , had a bit of stubble , and it was n’t sixteen year old wannabe stubble .   
His jacket was lighter than the weather warranted , but he wore multiple layers- a mix of clothes I ’d seen him in before and new ones .   
He met my eyes .
“ You look less tired than before , ” I said .
“
I ’m really tired , ” he said .   
“ Always am .   
The daylight hours are n’t as harrowing now , but the dreams have n’t stopped , wo n’t stop .   
Love Lost was restless last night .   
Angrier for some reason .   
I honestly would n’t be shocked to see her gang on that screen .
” I looked at the screen .   
A few new encounters had appeared .   
Eclipse Arc had apparently run for it , and somehow Spright and Flapper and two members of the Lone Wolf Pack had n’t been able to give chase .   
I ’d have to know more before I chalked it up as a draw or as a win .
“
Is it going okay ?
”
Rain asked .   
“
I know
Kenz was upset that she was going to be away and offline when this test run went online .
”
“ Tech - wise , I think we ’re okay .   
The map was n’t working that smoothly when I last looked , and the surveillance options are just showing black screens .   
I do n’t want to touch it in case
it ’s more tinker than tech .   
In terms of our early encounters and victories … ” Four patrols were active .   
In addition to that , one non - parahuman incident of crime had been foiled , Eclipse Arc had been scared away , and Bullhorn was now in the hands of the authorities .
“
We should be out there , ” Tristan said .   
He ’d taken off his coat and shoes and now carried his luggage bag of armor .   
“
It ’s going to look bad if we ’re absent .
”
“ Soon , ” I said .   
“ If we went out now , it would be a fishing expedition .
”
“
Fishing is fine , ” Tristan said .
“ We can do more later , when we ’re organized , ” I said .   
I floated over to my keyboard and opened my image folder .   
Images from last night .
Our IT person was both eleven and a tinker , so things had a way of getting weird or inconsistent if she was n’t around and keeping everything upright .   
I tried my hand at using the ‘ second monitor’ function with her temporary projector box , and was glad to see it worked .
The images were surveillance images of Tattletale and her gang .   
Their group was gathered by the back of Tattletale ’s rented vehicle with the trunk open – on the one side , guarding the open trunk , it was Tattletale , Imp , the crowd of Heartbroken kids , Chicken Little , and Tattletale ’s bodyguard Snuff .
They were with a group of ten people who were standing as a loosely organized group .   
For most of the ten , there was something in pose and posture that made it absolutely clear what their backgrounds were .   
Feet were planted a certain distance apart , many had arms folded or behind their backs , their backs ramrod straight .   
Most were exceedingly fit , or had the builds of people who had once been exceedingly fit and had slipped one way or the other with Gimel ’s food stores and quality being what it was .   
A lot of them looked like they shopped at the same stores , but a few broke the mold .
The pictures I ’d saved did n’t include the image that we ’d gotten of the trunk ’s contents before Chicken Little
’s birds had chased Kenzie ’s one working camera drone away .   
A plastic tote of guns , heavy enough that the back end of the truck had been heavy-
Rain ’s note .
Tattletale had fled Brockton Bay with the other Brockton - Bay Undersiders , namely Imp and Imp
’s gang , they ’d stopped at one place to regroup and wait for the stragglers , and then had immediately set to getting themselves prepared .   
Hired mercenaries , bought not with cash , but with a store of weapons .   
From there , they ’d met up with Parian and Foil , retiring for the night , all packing up together in a manufacturing area for Parian ’s clothing line .
They were n’t bad clothes , either .   
I had a sweatshirt dress with a watercolor - style image of Brockton Bay on the front that was by her , and another regular t - shirt with the watercolor image in negative , on a black fabric .   
She had similar designs for most of the major cities .   
I ’d bought some out of a kind of solidarity , and because they were actually kinda nice .
“ Question is , what is she up to today ?
” Tristan asked .
“
Yeah .   
That ’s a question , ” I said .
In my images , I ’d omitted the shots where Tattletale had been making repeated and pointed looks at cameras and other surveillance .   
She knew , fine .   
I ’d known she would know from the time she ’d caught Kenzie ’s camera tracking our conversation while it was a mere speck in the sky .
There was still nothing she could do about it .   
We could keep tabs on her , and all she could really do was have
Chicken Little send birds flying after our cameras .   
I suspected it annoyed her , but that was fine by me .   
She was on our turf now .
Things might get harder if she decided to have Foil take shots at the cameras , but sending that kind of projectile flying out over a populated area did n’t seem like the kind of thing the Flechette or Lily I ’d known would do .
“
Another win , ” Tristan ’s voice pulled me away from my musings .
“ Parahuman or civilian ?
”
I asked , walking back to the pair .
“ Non - powered .   
The Grower ’s Court ?
” Tristan asked .
“ Sounds vaguely familiar .
”
“ Farming collective kind of like what the Fallen had , ” Rain said .   
“
They decided they wanted to keep everything they grew , they did n’t want to pay taxes or give a share to the city , did n’t want anything from the city- ”
“ -Ignoring that the city gave them the seeds , machinery , and tools , built the roads , and provided material for the homes .
” Tristan said .
“
Sure , ” Rain said .   
“
Yeah , I guess so , did n’t hear that end of it , but it ’d have to be the case , right ? ”
“
It was , ” Tristan said .
“ Them deciding to hoard was a thing last spring , after the long winter .   
They holed up , everyone with a rifle , and city eventually said it was n’t worth it .   
Then this summer , in the middle of a lot of the craziness , they blocked off a section of road , raided a truck , and took the stuff back to the Grower ’s Court .
”
“
And ?
” I asked .
“ And a month and a half later
, the Shepherds got enough people behind them to deal with it , ” Rain said .
“
They ’re civilians , but that ’s a win that might go in the papers , ” Tristan said .   
A smile crept across his face .   
“
We could reach out to the papers .   
Promote what we ’re doing .
”
“
Shepherd ’s win , their choice what to do with it .   
But you could let them know .
”
“ Uh , Rain can .   
While Moonsong is in charge , I ’m
leaving the Shepherds alone , ” Tristan said .   
“
In the meantime , I ’ll get changed , and we ’ll plan to go after your nemesis , instead ?
”
“
No on both counts , ” I said .
“
No ?
”
Tristan asked , hefting his bag , stepping toward the bathroom .   
“
There ’s a sign on the door that says ‘ death’ , with really awesome drawing of a skull .
”
I heard a shout of greeting from within the bathroom .
“
Sveta ’s in there , ” I said .   
“
She wanted to rinse off and clean her stuff ..   
She ’ll be out soon .   
Like
I said , no on both counts .   
No changing , and no , we are n’t going after Tattletale .
”
“
You ’re paying attention to her .
”
“
Damn fucking straight I am , ” I said .   
“
She ’s not someone you ignore , but she ’s not someone we pick a fight with either .   
That ’s a whole two squads of trained soldiers that are trading off shifts to support and guard her team around the clock .   
She also has twice as many parahumans on her team as we have on the full Breakthrough roster , if we pretend Chris is still on the team and we include Damsel .
”
“
She ’s not , you know , ” Rain said .   
“ Damsel wo n’t join .
”
“
She ’s tertiary .   
If someone comes after Breakthrough as a whole , they ’ll have to account for her .
”
Rain seemed to consider that .   
“
Yeah , sure .
”
“ We ’re not going after Tattletale .   
The Undersiders held their own for years .   
We ca n’t pick a fight with that .
”
“ We can try , ” Tristan said .   
“
Get some people together .
”
“ Nah , ” I said .   
I thought about it .   
“
Fuck no .   
There are other ways .
” ⊙ Kenzie was done with her classes .   
Ashley was through with her appointments .   
I felt bad that we ’d dragged them straight from that into an extended road trip .
Kenzie had her parents’ van , black , sleek , and sturdy enough to carry what she could bring from her workshop .   
Some of the components that we ’d strapped into place were serving as desks , Rain and Sveta leaning over papers as they sketched out loose ideas .   
Ashley was in the back , sitting opposite me , while Kenzie sat next to her with her feet propped up on a case , laptop on her lap in a way that let them both see the screen .   
Here and there , the remnants of lunches and snacks from the fill - up station littered the area .
Byron drove , because he was just a bit more secure driving on ice than Tristan was .   
I had the passenger seat , though I was twisted around to watch the others .   
My own laptop sat closed on my lap , still warm from when I ’d had it on .   
I did n’t have a power cable that plugged into the car , and that last twenty percent of battery was more valuable than having an easy way to fill the time .
Listening to the idle chatter was kind of nice on its own .   
Sveta and Rain collaborating .
“
What kind of scale ?
”
“
Um , I have to lift it with my own strength , right ?   
Not that big .   
Not giant mech big .
”
“
Good .   
Because I do n’t have the materials for a giant Svetamech .
”
“ Mecha - Sveta !
” Kenzie chirped .
“
I ’m already mecha - Sveta .
”
“
Double size ?   
Triple ?
”
Rain asked .
“ I had a friend who was larger than usual when I was with the Irregulars .   
The square cube law is a thing , is n’t it ?
”
“
Less a thing if you ’re working with tinkertech .   
It ’s part of why mechs are doable .   
Double sounds like an okay starting point , though .   
How do you want to sketch this out ?
”
“
What if we start really broad - stroke , and do this ?
”
“
That ’s calligraphy broad - stroke .   
Really broad - stroke .
”
“ For the shape .   
See ?   
Top - heavy , hourglass
…
”
Ashley talking to Kenzie in a quiet voice .
“ They went into my room .   
They went through my things .   
Some were tinker things , but I do n’t think they realized .
”
“ Off with their heads .
”
“ I wish I could take their heads off .   
I do n’t usually get mad , but I had a nice house and a nice workshop , and now I have to be there , and the people who should be protecting my things when I ’m not there are n’t .
”
“ If you ca n’t take their heads , why not scare them ?
”
“ Ashley , ” I used a warning tone .
They seemed to leave it at that .
In the distance , past a light but constant snowfall that was stirred into violent flurries by the existence of nearby portals , I could see the skyline of the New Brockton area of the city .   
Intervening buildings spoiled the view a bit , as did the mountain range to the west of the area .
“
Did n’t you tell Tristan that you thought the Undersiders would win in a fight ?
”
“
In a fight ?
”
I asked .   
“ I do n’t know .   
I do n’t think it ever comes straight down to a fight , though .   
There ’s other stuff .   
Information , misinformation , money , resources , having reinforcements , and protecting yourself .   
Those are the things that decide a fight before it even happens , or that cause horrible , long - term damage to you or places you care about , in a win - the - fight , lose - the - war way .
”
“
Things our team is n’t great at , ” Byron said .
“
They ’re better than us at it , but they were at this for six years .   
It ’s where they specialize and
it ’s where they ’ve been developing their skills and abilities since Kenzie was half the age she is now .   
Robbing casinos , stealing tech patents to ransom back , robbing stores and flying under the radar the entire time .   
Then they recruited a new member to kidnap that thinker I mentioned before , and sparked off two wars with parahuman gangs while using her , another local crime - boss thinker , and Tattletale to get enough of an edge and come out consistently ahead .   
Some people think the Endbringer attack was because of all that conflict .
”
“ Jesus , ” Byron said .
“
That ’s pretty darn close to what Weld described , ” Sveta said , behind me .
“
In fairness , we did compare notes and sit in on some of the same meetings , ” I said .
“ Fair , ” Sveta said .
I turned back to Byron .   
“
That was only the start of it .   
They ’re villains , and
while I ’m talking fairness ?   
They are n’t .   
They do n’t play fair .   
Tristan suggested picking a fight , and I think it ’s a bad idea , because we could get every hero in our coalition to go after them and the Undersiders might find a way to make the fight unfair in their favor .
”
“
The reason I brought it up is that I have to wonder if we ’ve collectively lost it , because as strong as they are , they ran .   
We ’re heading towards what they ran from .
”
“ We wo n’t enter the New Brockton area specifically , ” I said .   
“
How are we doing on your end , Kenzie ?
”
“
I ’m still getting the occasional blip .   
We ’re on the right road .
”
“
What if we get this far and there ’s nothing ?
” Sveta asked .
“
Then we spent some time driving around and talking .   
But going by what Kenz reported with the timeline-
”
“ They went somewhere , ” Kenzie said .
I opened my laptop .
9:41 PM , two vehicles with Undersiders inside are seen at the New Brockton area limits , leaving .
9:55 PM , two more vehicles are tracked leaving .
10:24 PM , all four vehicles are seen moving together .   
Judging by speed limits and where they are spotted , they were not traveling for the full duration .   
“
Tell us when we ’re close , ” I said .
“
Oh , we ’re close .   
Five more minutes .
”
“ Gear up , ” I said , folding up my laptop , sliding it between the seat and drink holder .
I had washed and laundered my costume , but my costume was fabric with decorations that Weld had fashioned for me before he ’d left , a higher quality than nearly anything I could have had made for a reasonable cost .   
I ’d removed the pieces to wash it all , and there were still some to replace on the costume .   
My hood had a thin length of metal running through the edge of the hood to keep it from slumping off to one side , and I did have to thread that through .
Two minutes of work , to do that , don the ten finger- and thumb - rings that had spikes sweeping back , resting against the backs of my hands , and fix the decorations at my shoulders so they were straight , connecting them to the armor , because designing the costume so the metal hung off the cloth would have had it pull down and drape weird .
The van pulled to a stop .   
We all opened our respective doors .
A truck rest stop .   
Dirt road , shoulder - high concrete barriers to guide any errant or out of control trucks , and a fair amount of open space .   
There were a pair of portable toilets with bright yellow sides in the corner , and a diner - style restaurant a two minute walk away , but as I turned to Kenzie and pointed at the diner , she shook her head .
“
Did she con us ?
” Sveta asked .
I held out a hand , telling them to stay put , and then I floated up and over the battlefield .   
It was still early afternoon , and the light was good .   
I could see where boots had scuffed the frost - hard dirt , and I could see spots of blood .
“ Blood , ” I reported .
“ Truck stop ?   
I bet guys bleed here all the time , ” Rain said .
“
More blood , ” I pointed out .   
I indicated points on the ground .   
“
Something hard hit the ground here .   
Hard enough to break the frozen ground .   
And … a blast .
”
“ Blast ? ”
“ Come on , take a look for yourselves .   
I wanted to keep the ground reasonably pristine for a first - look , in case there was anything .   
No need now-
I ’m
pretty sure some trucks came through today .
”
The group fanned out , searching the perimeter .   
Once they got far enough , I showed them where the ground had been gouged by something .   
The gouging clustered in areas .
“ I found bullet casings , ” Ashley said .   
She ’d veered furthest from the group .   
Way off to the side , where the dirt gave way to the still - new , pavement of the highway , she ’d found the casings .   
Bending down , long skirt blowing against her bare calves , she used a finger to prod one casing .
“
Careful you do n’t taint the evidence , ” Rain said .   
“ Victoria ’s right .
”
Ashley stood straight , her chin rising in that imperious way .   
She approached Rain at a slow walk .
“
Hee , ” Kenzie made a happy sound .
“
I ’m
missing something , ” Rain said .
Ashley nodded , holding up a hand .
“
I ’m
… fuck .   
I ’m the prosthetics tinker , and I forgot about your hands .   
You have no fingerprints , no skin oil .
”
“ There we go , ” she said , smiling .   
Her left shoulder brushed his as she walked past him , then brushed against his shoulderblades as she walked around behind him .
“
That is the fucking smuggest I ’ve seen you , Ashley , ” Tristan said .   
He and Byron had apparently swapped out to share notes as they ’d done their own walk of the scene .   
“
That ’s cat with the canary smug .
”
“ Nuh uh !   
She ’s not smug , she ’s happy .
”
“
Same thing , ” Ashley said .   
“
I ’m happy
my hands are this good .
”
“ Food particles , though ?
”
Rain asked , turning around to face her , a little obstinate now .   
“
We just ate , and we did n’t wash our hands .
”
Ashley let her power flicker around her hands , making a sound like a snarl as it washed over the prosthetic limb .   
“
I cleaned it earlier .
” Rain sighed .   
“ You win .
”
“ As it should be .
”
One vehicle with a crate of guns , to later be used to purchase or barter for the services of mercenaries .   
depending on timing , the Undersiders would have had two vehicles worth of people here , or they would have had four .
Assuming they were running , the attackers would have come from the northeast .   
The Undersiders would have been fleeing the southwest .   
The bullet casing came from the Undersider ’s end of the scene .
“ I think we ’re ready , ” I said .   
“ we should get going before we get in trouble for camping out at a truck stop .
”
“ Awesome ! ”
Kenzie said .   
She drew her phone , then selected the program .
The van bucked visibly as the machinery in the back kicked to life .
“ I was able to speed things up just a bit , because having everything in the van meant I was able to bring extra batteries , and I could box it up a bit .
”
“
Box it up ?
” Sveta asked .
“ I do two things .   
Like a tinker who does jets and does , I dunno , radiation .   
They can make jets or they can make radiation , but radiation - powered jets are their best work .   
For me , it ’s cameras and boxes .   
Box - cameras are best .
”
“ Inconveniently sized boxes , ” Rain said .
“
I made this camera inconveniently big for regular carrying .   
Let ’s give this a shot .
”
“
Let ’s be careful not to put images in the middle of the highway , ” I said , indicating the cars that were flying past us on the other side of the concrete barrier .
“
Done .
”
The past - camera kicked into life .   
All around us , the space began to fill out with dots of color .   
If she was going to be aware of when we watched her in the present , we would shift our focus from her to her past .
The snow did make things more difficult , each flake becoming a lone thread , with threads joining together into an opaque curtain that marked the wild commonalities in how the air moved , reacting to the passage of cars on the other side of the divider , and the constant outflow from the portal .
Then , much as they ’d started to appear and get drawn out , the snowflakes were undone , each trail disappearing one by one .   
All of the rest of the images started to come together , each one a caterpillar , a long blur that traced the paths the individuals had traveled .   
The passage of vehicles were like the strokes of fat , crude brushes that crossed out whole sections of the picture .
“
I ’ve got some data on the Undersiders already , ” Kenzie said .   
“
We can narrow this down .   
I ’ll pick some images to lock down by the points in space .
”
Tattletale was first .   
At the Southwestern end of the clearing .   
Ducking down .   
She was wearing a coat and earmuffs , alongside her mask and costume .   
Slowly , the figure right behind her began to fill in .   
Snuff , standing right behind her , shielding her with his body , one hand extended toward the source of whatever he was shielding her from .
The car was next , filling in .   
Door open , as Tattletale ducked inside .
All around us , figures were appearing .   
The kids with dense black waves and curls of hair , most dressed in black , all with masks of their own .   
Heartbroken .
Imp , stumbling as she tried to shield the kids .   
One of her arms was gone .
“
Any loose arms , Kenz ?
”
“ Weapons ?
”
I pointed at Imp .
“
Eew .   
I ’ll try searching for it .   
Ca n’t be too hard to find .
”
The rest of the group was so quiet that it was almost grim .   
There were so many people .
Not far from the Undersiders , with an armored vehicle of their own , three people .   
The shooter responsible for the gun casing , a man , and a woman .
The red - haired shooter would be Shamrock .   
The man was Gregor .   
The woman , though she was n’t fully drawn yet , and though her dark costume was concealing enough to muddy things further , was likely Faultline .
How desperate were you , that you went to her ?   
I thought , looking at the image of a retreating Tattletale .   
The Undersiders had met with the Palanquin mercenaries , despite the fact that Tattletale ’s feud with Faultline was common knowledge .   
I ’d heard it had something to do with Tattletale getting beaten out by Faultline on an early job , and then never really getting an opportunity to even the score after .   
I was n’t sure if that had been pure speculation from Crystal .
“
Getting a whole lot of mess while I ’m looking for the arm .   
Hold on , ” Kenzie said .   
“
Lots of power effects to fill in , and they ’re messier than people .
”
“
It ’s fine , ” I said .   
“
This is really good , Kenz .
”
I saw her bob her head in an excited way , pacing around as she held up her phone .   
Here and there , she erased progress or shifted something so it was loading a figure at a different point .
This was n’t a moment in time .   
It was well over a dozen things being captured at critical moments .
At Snuff ’s left hand , a black - gray blob , taller than he was , the air distorting at the edges .
At one point in the ground , a plume of dirt and pavement .
In the air , Imp ’s arm .   
A silvery thread connected to it , and that silvery thread traced its way to the attackers .
“
Sorry , ” I whispered , whispering because it was a kind of tacit acknowledgement that she could n’t and would n’t hear me .
I did feel sympathy , but I did n’t feel bad , exactly .   
They ’d brought a mess down on their own heads somehow .   
They ’d made enemies and they ’d answered for it .   
I had no idea what we ’d do or how we would handle it if it came down to it .   
I could n’t see us standing by and letting cape fights happen , but it did n’t feel right to take the Undersiders’ side either .
Or maybe … “ Sveta , ” I said .
“
Mmm ?
” she asked .   
She was standing near the still images of Faultline ’s crew .
“ The Undersiders played a part in saving the world ?
”
“
Yeah , ” she said .
Still did n’t feel right to intervene on their behalf , but by the rules , at least , by the unwritten laws ?   
Maybe .
Uuuuuuuugh .
Snow blew around us .   
I was aware of cars on the road that had slowed to see what we were doing .   
Standing in the middle of a firefight that made no logistical sense , as each piece of the puzzle was frozen at a different time and place than the others .   
Powers were flying , bullets in the air , people mid - motion , and none of it jibed .   
Jibing would have to be puzzled out in another way at another place .   
That was if there were clues to be gathered there .
“
It ’s going to be another few minutes .   
These people are all packed in together , and I can do things like take a snapshot of EM levels , or brainwaves , or DNA , but I keep getting cross - signals .   
I ’m having trouble pulling them apart .   
But we will !   
We will figure out who you all are , mysterious attackers !
”
“ I know who one of them is , ” Tristan said .
“
We know them , ” Rain said .
“ You-
you saw enough details to do a visual ?   
You must have a power if you did , because my onboard camera is n’t getting a good lock .
”
“
Not a power , ” Rain said .   
“ Passing familiarity .
”
“
Do tell , ” Ashley said .
“
That right there ?
” he indicated the people who were gathered as a mass .   
“
That ’s messy because it ’s a cluster .   
And right beside it ?
”
“
What ? ”
Kenzie asked .
“
Another cluster , ” Rain said .
“
There ’s another , ” Tristan said .   
He indicated the gouges in the ground with the earth spewing from them .   
“
I know this one .   
He was n’t at the Fallen fight , but there ’s some old history .
”
“ Paris ?
”
Rain asked , his head snapping around .
Tristan nodded .   
“ Or one of his cluster .   
But that silhouette looks right .
”
“
Oh , ” Kenzie said , hurrying to type out a word on her phone .   
She aimed at the center of the back , and an image flickered across the spaces she was aiming at , its head trying fifty different orientations before finding something suitable .   
“
Then this is-
”
“ March , ” I said , an instant before the image of her ‘ hare’ mask and the brimmed hat with the masks’ ears poking out the front came into solid , crystal - clear focus .
“
She recruited , ” Ashley observed .
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .
“
She did n’t try to recruit you ?
” Sveta asked .
“ I was in jail .   
Maybe she tried ? ”








“
Oh no , ” Swansong said , her voice deadpan .   
“
It ’s the fuzz .
”
“
Oh no !
”
Lookout echoed Swansong , her voice anything but deadpan .   
“ Are we in trouble ?   
What do we say ?   
What do I do ?
”
The cop cars were pulling into the truck stop from the highway .   
They saw the scene and slowed down .   
Two cars , each with two cops .   
Since identifying March ’s group , we ’d been moving the scene around a bit to investigate and see if we could work out any details .   
The plan had been to leave in another minute or two , after Lookout
’s data had saved .
“ Start by calming down , ” Sveta said .   
“
We ’re good guys .
”
“ I ’ve had serious talks with police officers nine times , and it went bad seven of those times , ”
Lookout said , her eyes fixed on the cop car .
The officers had come to a complete stop at a point before the concrete barrier properly started .   
It gave them the ability to hop in their cars and turn off onto the highway .   
They emerged .
“
Can you take down the images ?
” I asked .   
“
The cops seem intimidated .
”
“ Not without losing the data .   
Do we want to lose the data ?
”
Split second decision : get shot or lose the data ?
“
Keep the data , ” I said .
“
What if you dim it ?
” Rain suggested .   
“ Make it look fake .
”
“ That I can do .   
Opacity down .   
Doing it .   
Please do n’t make me talk to the cops .   
It always turns out bad .
”
All around us , the images of Tattletale ’s group , Faultline ’s trio and March ’s multi - cluster shifted tint and became see - through .
I raised a hand , holding it over my head as I walked toward the officers .   
Capricorn followed , while the rest of the group hung back a bit .
“
Hi guys !
”
Capricorn called out .   
Tristan .   
“
We ’re on your side !
”
The cops did n’t relax .   
We continued to approach until one older officer who had his gun drawn raised it a fraction .   
Not quite pointing at us , but if we approached another few steps , then it might well be .   
A good thirty feet of distance separated us from them .
“
What the hell is all this ?
” the older officer asked .
Tristan turned his head to look , his hands still out to his sides .   
“
We ’re heroes .   
We were trying to track down some rivals , used some power stuff to see if we could see what they were doing at their last reported location , here , and found this .
”
“
It ’s a bit of a mess that we ’re trying to puzzle out , ” Capricorn said .
The younger guy by the old officer ’s side turned around , taking it all in .   
His back to us as he looked over in the direction of March ’s truck , he used the most innocent of tones as he said , “ You were the ones on television a few nights ago .
”
“ We were , ” I answered him .   
“ I remember talking about how we wanted to share information and enforce cooperation .   
If you want , we can give you a tour of this scene , catch you up .
”
“
No thanks , ” the old guy said .   
He looked at the younger cop that I presumed was his partner .   
“
They ’re heroes ?
”
“
Yeah .
”
He broke his stance , no longer ready to drop into a firing position , gun no longer almost pointed at us .   
He did n’t put it away , though .
“ You were part of the prison thing too , ” the young guy said .
“
Yeah , ” Capricorn said .
The old guy took a step to the side , leaning in close to his buddy .   
He asked a question under his breath , clearly not intended to be heard by the pair of us .
I caught ‘ clown’ in the middle .   
It was answered with a half smile and half - shrug .
Ass - clowns .   
Great .
“
One of the reasons we went on the show was to force some hands , flush some birds out of the bushes , ” Capricorn said .   
“
The people who pulled the prison breakout were the birds .
”
“ Tried something , you failed , and the rest of us suffer ?
” the old guy asked .   
There was an edge to his voice .   
“
And here you are , trying something else ?
”
“ We succeeded , ” I said .   
“ Birds flushed out , birds stopped or temporarily neutered .   
The problem is , the way things are right now , we stop two big villains , and there are two more in the shadows , ready to step out and take advantage of the situation .   
We ’re poised on a crumbling ledge , and we ’re … trying to keep it all upright .
”
“
I ’m not one for the poetics , ” the old guy said , staring across the distance at me .   
The other two cops seemed to think the situation was n’t escalating , and were walking over to the March multi - cluster hologram , investigating .   
“ Birds and crumbling ledges .
”
“
You ’re not giving her a fair shake , ” Capricorn said , “ Officer … ?
”
“ Senior Trooper Littlejohn .
”
“ Sir , ” Capricorn said , “ With my last team , I did some ride - alongs with officers .   
I heard their frustrations again and again .   
I know
it ’s a thing :
whether you ’re a paramedic trying to stay ahead of a drug epidemic , a trooper or senior trooper trying to deal with gangs , or hell , a teacher trying to save young minds , you run into the futility of it all , it ’s the same .   
Score a win today , and tomorrow it can seem as if nothing changed .
”
The old guy was quiet .   
The young guy looked over his shoulder , his attention divided between us and the still images .
Capricorn , sensing he was n’t going to get an answer , added , “
Do n’t do to us
what I ’m
betting hundreds of people have done to you .   
Do n’t tell us we did n’t make a difference when you were n’t there to see .
”
Littlejohn did n’t respond for a second .   
He did look at his partner , who shrugged , unsmiling .
“
Sure .   
I wo n’t tell you , ” Littlejohn said .
Nicely , neatly ambiguous , as responses went .
“ Over there , ” I said , indicating Tattletale ’s group .   
“ Undersiders .   
Took over Brockton Bay .   
They were running New Brockton .   
They did some scummy stuff , they helped save the world .   
It ’s complicated .
”
“
That ’s her , huh ?   
Tattletale in the flesh ?
” the younger officer asked .   
“
We keep hearing her name .
”
“ Tattletale , but it ’s only a … very advanced simulation of a scene from last night .   
Hologram .   
Beside her are mercenaries from Palanquin .
”
“
Do n’t know them , ” the young officer stated .
“ You have to get into murky waters to get a good answer there , ” I said .   
“ June twentieth , twenty - eleven .   
The day that the PRT broke .   
An event in Brockton Bay .   
Everything classified , but there was a mass exodus of heroes from the Protectorate and Wards program .   
It was the day the portal appeared in Brockton Bay .
” I looked over at the horizon .   
The portal had warped , distorting , and New Brockton had been cleaved in half .   
A slice of sky that was different from the rest .
“
And ? ” Littlejohn asked .
“
Palanquin started traveling the world , opening portals for buyers .   
They have ties to the Undersiders , not necessarily friendly ties .   
But they ’re tied into it all .
”
“ And the third group ?
” Littlejohn asked .
I was so tempted to say ‘ ass - clowns’ , to borrow his phrasing from earlier .   
I gave it a fifty - fifty on either winning him over or souring the dialogue , based on my read of him .   
Not good enough odds .
“
Ca n’t say for sure , but they seem to be the people who are stepping in to fill a recent void , picking up where the last set of troublemakers left off .   
We were figuring it out when you came , ” I said .
“
Always something , huh ? ”
Littlejohn directed the question at Capricorn .   
“
I never took the ‘ capes’ seriously .   
Endbringers seemed too far away .   
It was too many masks and nicknames to keep track of , all kid stuff .   
Then , y’know .   
All at once , it was all too serious .
”
I nodded , pushing thoughts out of my head and trying to maintain a poker face .   
The ‘ all at once’ for me was n’t the one he was thinking of .
“
Yeah .   
I do n’t blame you .   
When this stuff is great , it ’s goofy , ” Capricorn said .   
“
When it ’s bad , it ’s bad enough you do n’t want to talk about it .   
Most of the time , it ’s like I said before .   
We ’re trying to improve things a bit at a time , even when it looks like it ’s not getting us anywhere .
”
Littlejohn turned his head and whistled for attention .   
The two officers who had wandered off returned to us .
“ Nimmons , move the cars to block off the stop .   
Park them both
so it looks neat and calm .   
Be ready to move if a truck needs to roll in .   
Alves ?   
Up on that concrete barrier .   
Keep an eye on traffic , keep it moving .   
You could try holding onto a notebook , act like
you ’re taking down license plate numbers of the ones who are moving too slow .
” They listened and obeyed without objection .
“ We got called in because something was up .   
Reason we ’re staying is that it ’s a truck stop , and you ’re not trucks , you ’re obstructing , ” Littlejohn told us .
“ We can be gone in a minute , ” I said .
“ If you need to look around more , then do that , just do n’t take too long doing it .   
If these loons are the next ass - clowns in line to cause trouble , it ’s better
we get them before they ’ve figured out
which way is up .
”
It ’s a little more complicated than that .   
They ’ve figured out a lot more than which way is up .
“ Sounds good , ” I said .   
“ Thank you , sir .
”
“
Explain some of this to me as you go .   
I should know more than I do .
”
“
Absolutely , ” I said .   
“ Geez , where to start ?
”
“
Why does this all look wrong to me ?   
Does n’t look like it meshes together .
”
“ It does n’t , ” I said , as we walked back toward the rest of the group .   
“
It ’s the puzzle we were trying to put together :
what goes where .   
We can ask Lookout-
she ’s running the simulation .   
We froze a few key scenes that we worked out .
”
“
Show me ?   
These are people from my city , apparently .
”
“ They were .   
We were in the middle of trying to figure out if they ’re leaving because someone worse scared them away , or if they left to go protect some people elsewhere .   
Lookout !   
Scene one ! ?
”
The scene around us shifted .   
The moment where Tattletale was mid - meeting with Faultline , Chicken Little and the Heartbroken sitting on the front of the parked cars , where headlights illuminated the light snow .   
Trails marked where snow clumps had been rolled against the ground to form snowballs .   
They had been stacked into miniature snowmen .   
Chicken Little had two birds in the snow on either side of what looked like a failed snow - bird , the outstretched wings having crumbled under their own weight .
I pointed at that , then spun around to point at the other end .   
The headlights of March ’s vehicle were sweeping into the lot as it pulled in , but March was n’t waiting that long .   
She sat in the open window of the car , leaning over the hood with a rifle in her hands .   
The frozen scene had captured the muzzle flash .   
Even from a distance , there was something in March ’s eye-
she wore her mask
so it covered half of her face , her left eye peering through the right eyehole of the mask .   
The adjustment of the mask freed her to look down the rifle ’s scope .
“
Page us through slowly ?
”
I asked Lookout .   
No need to raise my voice now that we were closer .
A matter of ten feet from us , the image of Tattletale had shifted , and was mid - reaction , the bullet having connected .   
A bullet to the back of the thigh .   
The other thigh had a fresh wound on it .   
The reason there had n’t been more blood on the snow was that most of the gore had hit the side and interior of the car .   
The only thing that kept Tattletale from going straight to the ground was Snuff ’s grip on her arm .
“ Eliminating the competition ?
”
“
Honestly ?   
Probably not .   
But depending on how this works out , she might as well be .   
It ’s just going to be someone crazier and more dangerous than the one who dresses up as a march hare and shoots with kids in the line of fire .
”
“
Costumed kids .   
Heartbroken , I think ?
”
“
Yeah .   
Heartbroken and Chicken Little .   
But kids are supposed to be off - limits .   
You go easy .
” Littlejohn nodded .
There was a scene between this one and the first one we ’d started to piece together .   
Shamrock opening fire .   
Gregor slinging a blob of slime .   
Snuff was practically throwing Tattletale into the vehicle while his power blocked out an area in front of him .   
Not as much of a dark blob as we ’d originally thought- that had been the overlapping of multiple effects .
“
Shamrock shot one of March ’s people .   
March ’s person immediately reacts , lashes out-    Lookout ?
”
We caught the scene from earlier .   
Dismemberment .   
The kids now on their way to the vehicles .   
March had been disarmed by Shamrock ’s shot , the rifle broken at the wooden base just a half - inch from March ’s hand , but March had other people leaning out the windows and over the vehicle .
“
Who ’s the bridge troll ?
”
The question came from Littlejohn ’s partner .   
He indicated Gregor the Snail , who was shielding some of the Heartbroken kids with his body as they got into one of the Undersider ’s vehicles .   
He was wearing full costume , and his body visibly steamed , though the projection did n’t catch all of the steam , making it look cut off or jagged in places .
“
That ’s Gregor , ” Sveta said .   
“
From my very limited exposure to him and everything I ’ve heard , he ’s apparently a gentleman .
”
“
He ’s wearing a fishnet shirt in minus - something weather .   
Does n’t seem gentlemanly to be around kids like that .
”
“ They do n’t seem to mind , ” Sveta said .
“
I ’m a kid
and I do n’t mind .   
He looks huggable .
”
“ I like it , ” Swansong said .   
“ Dark
, bold . ”
Littlejohn ’s partner scoffed a bit .
“
And they ’re kids who hang out with supervillains , ” I pointed out .   
“ Heartbroken and Tattletale ’s protege .   
Playing in the snow while the adults talk is probably as kid - like as things get for them .   
I do n’t think fishnets are even on their radar .
”
“ The one with the bird mask is the protege ?
” Littlejohn asked me .   
I nodded my confirmation .
“ Maybe he likes it , ” Sveta said .
“
You can relax , ”
Littlejohn ’s partner said .   
“
You ’re making more of a deal of it than I meant to say .
”
“
His wife probably likes it , ” Sveta said , indicating Shamrock .
“
No shit ? ”
Littlejohn ’s partner asked .   
“
I kind of hate him now .
”
“ Funny thing is , I think you could say that to his face , and he would just accept it , ” Sveta said .   
“
I think we should stop here before I get pissed off .
”
“
Woah there , ” Littlejohn ’s partner replied .
“
Let ’s end it , ” I said , and I said it quiet , where only Littlejohn and Capricorn could hear .
“ Troy , ” Littlejohn said .
‘ Troy’ stopped , going silent , and looking at his partner .
“ Head on over to the other end , near the cars .   
See if you ca n’t spot anything about the truck the attacker is driving , or the people inside .
”
Troy seemed eminently unbothered as he shrugged one shoulder , heading over to the truck .   
I found myself wishing he ’d looked more annoyed or hurt about being sent away .
Sveta would be annoyed and hurt .   
I knew that much .
“
Thank you , ” I said .
“ Tell me more about this , ” he said .   
“
Who are these people ?
”
He ’d indicated Imp .   
In the last scene we ’d pieced together , Imp had an arm that replaced the one that had been torn away .   
The new arm was a different skin tone and had a bad bullet wound .
I was starting to explain when Lookout showed something on her phone to Ashley , then to others .   
I trailed off , motioning for her to show me and Littlejohn .
“ I got enough detail to map it out .   
We have license plate and vehicle serial numbers on the frame of the vehicle .
”
“
Whose ?
” I asked .
“ Faultline , ” Lookout said .
“ I could check databases , ” Senior Trooper Littlejohn told us .
“ I think I ’ve got it already , ” Lookout said .
“
But thank you , ” I added .   
“
Listen , we were pursuing a lead when we got this far .   
This is your territory .   
Do you want to take jurisdiction over this scene ?   
Use of weapons , cape stuff ?
”
“
Fuck no , ” Littlejohn said .
“
It ’s okay if we handle it ?
”
“ Probably not .   
Except this looks like a steaming pile of mess , and I want no part of it .   
You want to own this ?
”
“
We ca n’t pin them for a crime , but we can try to keep this from becoming a string of incidents , and we can keep you in the loop .
”
“ We ’re going to go talk to Palanquin ?
” Sveta asked , and she was n’t quite able to hide her excitement .
⊙ Tristan leaned back , a phone pressed to his ear .   
His helmet was in his lap .
I saw his eyebrows go up as the person on the other end answered .
“
We ’re not new clients , ” he said .   
“
We ’re parked a block away from you .   
We ’d like to approach , talk , see if we ca n’t both help each other .
”
The phone dropped from his ear .
“ They hang up ?
”
Rain asked .
Tristan shook his head .   
“ They ’re checking .
”
A voice on the other end cheeped through the phone ’s speaker .   
Tristan raised it to his ear .
“
How did we find you ?
” he asked .
“ We followed Tattletale ’s path to the bus stop .   
There was camera footage that had the license plate on it .
”
Tristan repeated it , then covered the mouth - part with his hand to repeat ,   
“
There were no cameras at the location .   
They checked .   
Do we tell them ?
”
“ We have very good cameras , ” Swansong said .
“ We have good cameras , ” Tristan said .   
“
We ’re not trying to be ominous here .   
We want to talk and get ahead of whatever is going on .
”
A pause .
“
Yeah .   
We ’re Breakthrough .
”
Tristan glanced at me , then put the phone down .   
“ We can approach .
”
“
Can we get a camera in the air ?
”
I asked Lookout .
“
Yep !   
I ’ve got just the one !
”
She pulled the football - sized flying camera out of the case
she ’d been resting her feet on .
“ Is that ‘ just the one’ because it ’s special , or because it ’s your last one ?
”
Rain asked .
“
Both !   
It ’s both .
”
Sveta opened the door .   
Rain and Swansong were putting their masks on .   
Circuit - board face , with circuits cutting fissure - like zig - zags , gloves doing much the same , all black , with lines that glowed dully with a red light from within .   
A slight change from before .   
A hooded costume top covered his hair , which was n’t new .
Using three arms , he slung a satchel - bag over his shoulder as he hopped down onto snow - wet road .
The Palanquin mercenaries were organized in a line along the front of one nice , modern looking building , looking like professionals with how they held themselves , though it was a very different thing from the hired mercenaries we ’d seen around Tattletale .
Faultline , Gregor , Shamrock , a thinner - than - realistically - possible Case-53 , and a woman I did n’t recognize , with bangs cut straight across her forehead .
I ’d expected the lines of no - man’s - land to be drawn out as they had with the police visiting the scene .   
Instead , Sveta just kept walking .
I could see Faultline ’s entire lineup tense at that , that the line was so flagrantly being breached .
Then the recognition from Gregor .
He strode forward , and though he was n’t much taller than an average guy , he still picked Sveta up , hugging her in a way that had her feet dangling .
No man
’s land effectively shrunk .   
There were n’t twenty feet of distance , but instead it was us standing close enough that we could talk normally , not so close that our two large groups became a huddle .
Faultline had updated her costume , I noted .   
Tinkertech .   
Tinkertech from outside one
’s own team was generally very expensive , because it was temperamental , and there was only one person who could soothe that temper or fix it if anything went wrong .   
Yet none of her people looked like tinkers .
As soon as she was out of Gregor ’s arms , Sveta hugged Shamrock .
“
I take it
you vouch for them , Gregor ?
”
“ I vouch for Sveta .
”
“
And I vouch for them , ” Sveta said .
“ Not quite that easy , ” Faultline answered .   
“
We ’re on a job , we have clients to safeguard .   
But Gregor likes you , Sveta , and
I trust Gregor with my life .   
We ’re going to move , because being out in the open exposes us to danger .   
We walk with your team in single file .   
You ’ll come with us , no fast movements , no tricks , no powers , and nothing finds its way to your hands .   
We ’ll also need to search you .
”
I glanced at Capricorn , only to see that the armor had a blue tint .   
Tristan had backed off for reasons unclear to me .
“
Okay , ” I said .
“ Whippersnap , could you check them ?   
Please stay still .   
Arms up , feet spread .
”
I raised my arms , holding them apart .
Whippersnap was the literally broomstick - thin Case-53 with skin stretched too tight across a half - width skull , large , juicy eyes bulging out of eye sockets to either side , to the point that it looked like he could literally look backwards .   
The eyes were slow to move , scraping against the sockets , but they moved almost constantly .
He was at my side with an audible noise on arrival .   
With a disconcerting speed , his hands touched and lightly slapped me , starting at my collar and hood , then working down .
It felt more invasive than an ordinary strip search , because it was so fast and thorough
I felt like I was being laid bare .
He was a speedster , but he looked and felt a damn sight like a bio - speedster .   
There were breaker speedsters like Velocity , who shifted into an alternate state to access reality on a different level , there were ones who had a great deal of propulsion , ones that manipulated the environment , and then there were the ones who just had biology that alien – usually through changer powers .
“
Hi Whippersnap , ” Sveta said , as I was left alone , the full search moving to Byron , for a full search of Byron ’s armor .
With a sound like a whipcrack , Whippersnap moved faster , closing the distance between himself and Sveta .   
The sound had come from him extending an arm , pointing at her .
“ I ’d like to put all of the bad stuff behind us , ” Sveta said .
“ Tch .
”
“ Is this going to be a problem , Whipper ? ” Faultline asked .
“ Neh , ” Whippersnap replied .
He took only another twenty seconds to search the rest of the team before stopping at Sveta .   
“
Ca n’t search her without dying .
”
“ I vouched for her , ” Gregor said .
“
You could cork her with a mucus plug , ” Whippersnap said .   
“ Seal that suit closed .
”
“ I will not do that , I ’m sorry .
”
“
Real nice , Whipper , ” Sveta said .
“
I ’m being nice , ” Whippersnap said ,
his voice a hiss .   
I could see veins stand out through the too - tight skin .   
Cords and muscles bulged at the corners of his jaw .   
“
I could have said no vouch , anti - vouch .   
You betrayed my team .   
But I am new , but out of respect for Brother Gregor and the boss , I ’m quiet for now .   
I am a professional .
”
“ We can talk at the next chance we get , ” Gregor said .   
“
For now , Faultline , any feelings ?
”
“
No plug or sealing her into her suit .   
Follow , before we ’re out of time , ” Faultline said .   
“ Stick to my rules .   
Be good .   
March has enhanced accuracy and advanced timing .
”
“ Like Flechette , ” I said .   
I winced .   
“ Foil .
”
“
Different .   
Timing is her main power .   
Situational , big - picture .   
Operation - level
. ”
“
She was good on the small scale too ,
” I said , following Faultline .   
“ Is that stronger because she used what she told us about ?   
The thing that let Goddess take all the power ?
”
“
No comment , not on that , ” Faultline said .
We were walking now , not into the nice building that they ’d gathered by , but down side streets .   
This was not a car area .   
It was hilly , with a lot of single - lane roads , and two rivers cutting through it that bottlenecked existing traffic across a finite number of bridges .   
It was nice , in a quaint , quiet way , no noise of trains or boats tooting their horns .
If I had n’t been able to fly , I might have taken issue with the fact that everything in this area seemed uphill or downhill .
Faultline went on , “ I ca n’t elaborate because It ’s pertinent to my client ’s needs and focuses , and it ’s for her to share .   
What you need to know is that March is someone with near - perfect accuracy , timing is n’t a consideration , and yes , these two things are linked when you ’re talking about shooting at moving targets .   
She knows how to use a sniper rifle .   
What ’s more dangerous is that when she sets things in motion , she has a sense of what ’s going to end up where .
”
“
In a timing sense ?
” I asked .
“
Yes .
”
“
My old nemesis , ” Lookout muttered .   
“ Time in the day .   
Timestamps .   
Recording by clocks and timers .   
It ’s madness .
”
“
It waits for no man , ” Swansong said .
“ The jerk .
”
“
What makes us safe now ?
”
I asked , raising my voice just a bit to drown out the background chatter .   
“
I assume we ’re safe now .
”
“ We took measures , but they ’re time - limited , which is why we ’re walking to a confidential but safe place instead of talking any more out in the open .
”
“
We ’ll follow your rules , help keep to your time limit , ” Byron ’s voice was soft .
Rain , meanwhile , was absolutely quiet at this point .   
I wanted to ask questions , but I did n’t want to complicate things with the already tense , no - nonsense vibe that Faultline was presenting .
She was a decent mercenary .   
This was her in her professional mode .
“ -Newter ?
”
I heard the tail end of Sveta ’s question to Gregor .   
She was leaning into him hard , like she sometimes did with me , unaware of her own particulars of movement or balance when she was n’t managing it all herself .   
“ Or Scrub
? ”
“
It is best if I do not share our team ’s strengths and weaknesses .   
Not without more thought .   
I am sorry , little cousin .
”
“ I understand .   
I really do .   
Maybe it ’s better that I do n’t know .   
Sorry .
”
“
It is better you do not know .
”
“
Do n’t say it like that , ” Shamrock said .
“ This way , ” Faultline said .
The street    had a corner , and past a lip of concrete preventing any errant cars from going down , there was a set of stairs leading down to a street further down the way .
We took those stairs , circled around one building , and then headed down another set of stairs to what looked like a basement area .
A headquarters .   
The stairs went down a long way , enough to leave the space expansive enough for ceilings at twice the usual height .
We were led down to the base of the stairs , before Faultline instructed us , “ Wait .
” We did , settling in to lean against walls .   
Sveta was talking to Shamrock and Gregor .   
Shamrock was saying something about places she ’d visited or seen- possibly related to Sveta talking about her summer with Weld .
Whippersnap had wandered off , except wandered was the wrong word , because it implied meandering .   
Saying he ’d run off was wrong too , because it implied running away .
Well , maybe that was right .   
It just did n’t seem quite appropriate .
Rain and Byron were talking , and Rain used all four arms as he gestured unconsciously-
no , he was gesturing to illustrate what he was saying about weapons , and what he ’d need to do to use them well .
“
Lookout , ” I said , lowering my voice .
“
Yes ?
”
“
How is that camera of yours in the sky doing ?
”
“
It ’s fine , ” she said .   
She pulled out her phone , and she showed both Swansong and me , then Rain , who was leaning over .   
“ Looking down .   
Nothing strange .
”
An overhead view of the area .
“
Anyone that could be following ?
”
“
None .   
If they followed , it was with a power .
”
“ If they followed , ” the woman with the bangs said , “ They wo n’t give you a chance .   
March will shoot , she will maim you if she wants to maim you , and she will kill you if she wants to kill .
”
“
What dialed March up to eleven ?
”
Rain asked .
“
A combination of things .   
She ’s excitable , and someone excited her .
” Faultline returned , alone .   
There were two more mercenaries with her .   
“ Situation blue .
”
“ Medical emergency ?
” I asked .   
“ The hospital code ?
”
“
What ?   
No , ” she told me .   
Then , not to me , she said , “ I ’ll leave it to you to interpret .
”
“
Good , ” the woman with the severe bangs said .   
“
Excuse me .
”
She walked away from the group and across the room .   
As she did , her body started to come apart in ribbons .   
As the ribbons came away , they revealed someone beneath .
The ribbons came together , forming a complete , different person , and then opened up once more .   
Another person beneath .
So it went .   
Each layer was something of a close relation with the one before it .   
By the time she was on her fourth layer down , the first woman had recovered enough to get up and walk away .
The fourth layer down , as it happened , was Tattletale .   
Two of her bodyguards seized her before her weight could come to rest on the legs that still had bloody bandages on them .   
She was moved to a chair , and made a face as she sat down .
The rest of us remained gathered in the lobby .
“ Got ta stick your nose in , huh , Vicky ?
”
“ Trying to stay on top of things , ” I said .   
“
What did you do ?
”
“
That ’s a pretty aggressive way of looking at it , Vicky , ” Byron said .
“
It was n’t entirely me , ” Tattletale said .
Of course .
I saw Whippersnap again , keeping company with a Case-53 of the same age , just a bit younger than Sveta .   
The girl was her overly elaborate lace dress and veil- the lace was her skin and the skin had a million intricate holes in it , with just a hint of red around the largest ones , where they looked deep in enough to see past tissues and look at raw flesh .
“
She ’s been recruiting , ” Tattletale said .   
“ Capricorn , you know Paris .   
Most of the recruits are singular actors from multiple clusters .   
Most , it turns out , are being brought in by a promise .   
She tells them that she knows how to leech power , as Goddess did .   
If they join her , she will tell them , after they ’ve helped her achieve her goals .   
If they do n’t , she tells one of their cluster - mates .   
With me so far ?
”
“
She made that offer to me , ” Rain said .   
“
But I think she ran into trouble .   
Of the two who are still alive , one wo n’t work with her , and the other is filled with too much rage to cooperate with anyone .   
They just want me dead .
”
“ Precipice , she ’s making the offer to Cradle .   
After Snag ?   
If you do n’t reach out and take her offer , she ’s going to give Cradle that knowledge .   
You can see where your hands are tied , do n’t you ?
”
Rain ’s mechanical hands strained a bit , metal on metal , as he clenched his four fists .
“
Yeah , all four of them , there you go .   
She used that , gathered some people , and she made it clear she wanted Foil .   
That ’s where I came in .
”
“
How do we know it ’s not a bluff ?
”
Swansong interrupted .
“
She has proof , kind of , ” Rain said .
“
Because , Swansong , she was a member of a cluster of three .   
Timing , accuracy , and Foil
’s trademark weapon enhancement .   
March found and drained their cluster
’s third .
”
“
She ’s very strong compared to Flechette , now , and that ’s her proof , ” Rain said .
“ Goddess dying answered a few lingering questions she had , things which were holding her back , ” Tattletale said .   
She turned around , and flagged down a mercenary .   
“ Painkillers .   
Something not too addictive , thank you .
”
She turned back our way and sighed .
“
What did you do ?
”
I asked , again .
“
She went after my teammate , and I told her that if she did n’t stop , I would take away her bargaining chip .   
I ’d figured it out myself , I would tell key members of the different multi - triggers- the enemies of her new ‘ recruits’ , if you will , how the draining works .
”
“
And ? ”








“ You threatened her and she forced your hand ?   
This is why you ca n’t play games with dangerous lunatics , ” I said .
“ I can .   
It ’s doable , ” Tattletale answered me , leaning back in her seat , sticking her tongue into her cheek
so it poked out .   
“ Does n’t always work out .
”
“ The issue is when others suffer because of the games you ’re playing , ” I said .
“ Here we go .   
Sanctimonious heroes being sanctimonious , ” she said .   
She rolled her head back , heaving out a sigh .
“
I ’m not arguing for morals , Tattletale .   
I ’m arguing for sanity .
”
“
Yeah .   
That ’s overrated too .
” Was it possible to respect the fact that she ’d been capable enough to take over and keep a city , and yet have zero respect for her as a person ?
I knew she prioritized sanity – or she prioritized stability .   
She ’d gone into laborious depth about how she was working to those ends when we ’d first met in New Brockton .   
But now , because she was hurt or because she was petty , she shrugged it off and pretended it did n’t matter .   
Tongue in cheek , joking , but still so tone - deaf .
“
What else do we need to know ?
”
Rain asked , stepping up because I had n’t followed up .   
A small part of me had been content to let the awkward comment hang .
Tattletale sat up straighter .   
She saw her henchman coming , carrying a tiny paper cup like the sort used for ketchup in fast food places and a regular paper cup for water .   
She took both , drawing out the pause before she gave her response .   
“
You , Precipice , need to make a decision when it comes to March .
”
“ I picked up on that .
”
“ I ’ve had to deal with her more than a few times , because that ’s the price of having Foil with us .   
As a professional she is efficient , dangerous , and dramatic .   
She ’ll almost always be in the right position , she ’ll almost always hit , and she ’ll almost always kill whatever she hits , provided she wants to .   
Her underlings support her well .   
She combines that professional effectiveness with being petty , unhinged , and lopsided in her focus in non - professional things , and lets the two things bleed into each other .
”
Gee , I wonder what it would be like to talk to someone like that , Tattletale , I thought .   
There might have been something in the look I gave Tattletale , because she rolled her eyes slightly .
“ Unhinged in person , still dangerous , ” Rain said .
“ I ’ve had to deal with some incredible pains in the ass in the course of my villainous career , ” Tattletale said .   
“
Some were on my team .   
March ?   
She ranks up there .   
Trust that I know
what I ’m talking about when I ’m
telling you this stuff .
”
“
Sure , ” Rain said .
“
My advice ?   
The thing you need to know ?   
If I were in your shoes , with the same relationship to that bunny - eared train wreck , I ’d suck it up , say goodbye to your little team of damaged , overzealous heroes , and join March ’s group .
”
“
No way , that does n’t make any sense at all , ” Lookout said .
“ It really does n’t , ” Rain said .
“ She does n’t make sense .   
She ’s this fixated on Foil , and Foil has barely interacted with her .   
She actually did you a huge favor , Precipice , getting involved when she did , providing sanctuary , and saving you from the Mathers witch .   
You owe her and if you give her an excuse , throwing that debt you owe in her face and ignoring her ?   
You will become her focus .
”
“
Is this your power talking or is it just you ?
”
I asked Tattletale .
“
Both .   
It ’s always both , and anyone who tells you it ’s one or the other is lying to your face .   
The powers always tie in .
”
“ If everything you ’re saying is true , it seems like it ’d be more dangerous to stick with her , ” Rain said .
I respected the ‘ if everything you ’re saying is true’ part .   
It showed he was n’t getting sucked into Tattletale ’s vortex .
“ Hon , she hunted down and recruited the Graeae twins for a Foil - related reason .   
I ’m certain of that .   
Let your imagination run wild as to why .   
Think of the most sketchy of the ‘ kiss’ applications of that power , I ’m sure Victoria can come up with something if your imagination fails you .   
Then think of the most sketchy ‘ kill’ application .   
Start with how she can functionally keep Foil alive forever .   
Then combine the two ideas .   
That ’s when she likes Foil .   
If you cross her , Precipice , then she wo n’t like you .
”
Victoria can help you come up with something .   
The words went past barbed to being something else .   
Bitter , even monstrously ugly if I considered that she ’d been there when I ’d been eaten alive by acid , and she knew what had happened after .   
She had n’t been able to resist getting the dig in , for cleverness ’s sake .
Chris had been the same , when I ’d first met him .   
Jessica had warned him .
No wonder that she was alone at a time she was this hurt .   
There was no friend at her side to make sure she was okay or to get her her medications .
Dwelling on that was easier than dwelling on the words themselves .   
Things were just a little bit less ‘ turn around and she could be there’ than they had been in recent weeks , but nothing was fixed .
Rain leaned back-
he was still at the foot of the long staircase to the high - ceilinged basement area , and leaning back meant resting his tailbone against the end of the post that was the railing .   
He did n’t talk , and with his mask on , his expression was hard to read .
“ I ca n’t help but feel you have ulterior motives for approaching this this way , ” I said .   
“
What was it
you said about having multiple reasons for everything you do ?   
That ’s how you have to operate at your level , is n’t it ?
”
“
It would be , but maybe I ’m not in charge of New Brockton while March is on the warpath , and maybe I ’m operating on two fewer cylinders .
”
Her hands gently touched her knees , indicating the injured legs .
“ ‘
Maybe’ is such a weak word , and you used it twice , ” Swansong said .   
“ Be straight with us .
”
“
I ’m being remarkably straight , considering you came here of your own accord and possibly led March to me
–
we ’re going to find out soon , ” she said .   
She winced .   
“
I should have asked for more pain meds .   
I did have multiple motives , yes .   
I ’ll be straight : when you do what I do , you end up playing games of chess with other masterminds , and that ’s its own thing , but you also end up playing five simultaneous games of chess with lesser players .   
March doing what she ’s doing has forced me to stand up and take my eyes off the boards .   
If you want to be on top of this , you need to be on top of that .
”
“ Watching chessboards ?
” Swansong asked .
“
No .   
The moment I had to stand up and walk away , they got to make their moves , knowing I could n’t respond .   
Big plans can unravel .
”
“
Your plans , ” I said .   
“ You ’ll have to give us more details if we ’re supposed to think that your plans are our priority .
”
“ Ashley knows how a sudden void in the criminal structure can shift the landscape .   
If I ’m not there to supply key information or resources , then others will .   
People will move into New Brockton , and they wo n’t be as nice as I am .   
Other people are going to move outward .   
This will have ripple effects , and when a city is held together with yellow duct tape , ripples can rip .
”
“ You want to use us to protect your position ?
” I asked .
Tattletale sighed loudly .   
“
I did n’t invite you to come here .   
If you want my opinion , you want to use yourselves to protect my position .   
You want to protect the status quo , keep things sane , as you put it .   
You brought up how I aimed to do multiple things at once .   
Apply that to yourselves .
”
“ You think we are n’t ?
” Swansong asked .
“
We ’re in the middle of other things , and this plays into it , ” I said .
“ I know what you ’re in the middle of , and you know I know .   
You ’re organizing the heroes , sharing information , making sure that the city still has a way to deal with the real threats , when thrown - together prisons do n’t have what it takes .   
How well do you think that ’s going to go over when you take the initial steps
and then the crime rate jumps three hundred percent ?
”
“
And clearly the answer is to throw our lot in with yours and help you , ” I said .
Tattletale put both hands on the seat , lifting up her upper body a fraction so she could adjust how her ass rested on the seat
’s surface , her face momentarily screwing up .   
She eased herself back down .   
“
Clearly it ’s going to happen whether you help me or not .   
But if you work with me on this , then I ’ll point you in the right direction , so you can work against the ripples .   
You can get ahead of this problem .
”
“
And we finally see what she ’s after , ” I murmured , keeping my voice barely audible .
“
It ’s not the worst deal in the world , ” Sveta murmured back .   
“
It ’s sharing info , which we wanted .   
And we know she ’s good .
”
“ It ’s sharing select info , ” I kept my voice quiet .   
“ If a police chief has his officers focus on majority - black neighborhoods , those officers end up acting in support of someone else ’s bias .   
If we target specific criminals that Tattletale points out for us , what does that mean ?
”
“
It means we get some easy catches , ” Rain whispered .   
“
We ’re not locking ourselves into anything .
”
“
It ’s not that simple or easy , ” I murmured .   
At a normal , louder volume , I addressed Tattletale , “ It ca n’t be you listing them one by one
and us picking them off .   
You give us the information , we decide what to do with it .
”
“
It ’ll take me a bit to pull together .   
I can do that , with one caveat .
”
“ Caveat ?
” I asked .
“
What does Caveat mean ?
”
Lookout whispered Ashley .
“ Stipulation .
”
“ Rule ?
”
Lookout whispered .
“
It ’s a condition , a drawback , ” Tattletale said .   
“
I ’m going to give you that full list , that ’s fine .   
Known locations , associations , some details on powers .   
You ’ll have it as soon as I ’ve finished typing , and you can distribute it to your team .   
But .
”
She placed emphasis on the ‘ but’ .
“
The caveat , ” I said .
“
I ’m going to give you all one very strong suggestion for who you specifically go after first .   
Take it as motivated or me serving my interests if you want .   
You can think it over for the next few days , ask a thinker to double check , whatever , you ’ll find it really is n’t .   
It ’s just sensible .
”
“
Who ?
” I asked .
“ Love Lost .
”
“
Why ? ”
Ashley asked .
“
Because if March tells Cradle the quote - unquote ‘ secret’ to taking over the cluster , Cradle has two options .   
One is to go after Precipice , who is expecting it , with an organized group at his back .
The other is to eliminate Love Lost and co - opt that power .
”
“
She has a team at her back , ” Ashley said .
“ Disorganized and reveling in that disorganization .   
And Cradle can get close enough to bypass that team and stab her in the back .   
Her team is also violent and swiftly rising to the top of the public
’s most wanted list .   
They ’re just high profile enough to grab attention , they ’re striking from a visual standpoint , they ’re noisy , they cause property damage , and they ’re vaguely reminiscent of the old Slaughterhouse Nine .   
People want them gone .
”
“ And
getting them gone wins us points with the people ?
” Byron asked .
Tattletale shrugged .
“
What ’s the secret ?
”
Rain asked .   
“
You said you told people .   
How are the Lady in Blue and March breaking the balance of their clusters ?
” Tattletale smiled .   
“
I could ask for a favor or payment for this information .
”
“
I ’m going to find out somehow , ” Rain said .
“ You might find out because Cradle or Love Lost use it on you .   
Knowing helps you to avoid it .
”
“ Tattletale , ” I said .   
“ If we ’re helping you by taking out your potential rivals and leaving you alone , you can throw Precipice a bone .
”
“ When I first met your team , Vicky , I commented on Precipice and how I do n’t think he ’s a great person .   
Cradle is twisted up inside in a way I ’d need a whole lot more time to wrap my head around .   
Love Lost is an emotional wound so open that the contents pour out to people nearby .   
And Snag is dead .   
All thanks to him .   
Through his inaction , he condemned people to die .   
Children died .
”
“ You act outraged , you have morals , but sufficient money , favors , and - or necessity let you put that outrage and those morals aside ?
” Sveta asked .   
“
That does n’t seem right .
”
“
Are you trying to convince me not to help him ?
”
“ I had to face down people like that once .   
At least have the decency not to act .   
Do the victims that much respect , ” Sveta said .
“
It ’s the other way around , Sveta .   
Tress .   
Garotte .   
I am bothered .   
I do n’t trust him .   
I ’ve seen his type before .   
If I ’m going to give a teenager of that particular type access to a whole new level of parahuman power , I need to double check things .
”
“
Then why ask about money or favors ?
” Rain asked .
“ Cauldron sold vials with powers in them .   
They created things like Sveta , Weld , Gregor and Whippersnap on their way to making those vials .   
The vials were expensive .   
Why , when they had a man like the Number Man working for them ?   
He could conjure money from thin air .
”
She ’d named a few of the other case fifty - threes .   
I looked- Gregor and Shamrock had long since moved on .   
Faultline seemed okay leaving just the mercenaries who were hanging around the area to watch us .
“
Why ?
”
Tattletale asked again , for emphasis , her right eyebrow piqued .
“
It limited things to the people who really wanted the powers , ” Sveta said .
“
Yes , but it also ensured that the people who got the powers respected the impact of it .   
If your team is willing to pay my price , then I know they ’ll walk away from that payment just a bit more mindful .   
Every time
the pocketbook smarts , you should think of him .
”
“ How much ?
” I asked .
Tattletale paused .   
Her eyes searched me .   
“ Not money .   
You seem fairly confident you can pay .   
That ’s interesting .   
Do you have a sponsorship ?
”
“
What do you want , Tattletale ?
”
“ I ’d ask for access to your information network-
”
“
No . ”
“
No , ” she said .   
She nodded .   
“ I want a ‘ get out of jail free’ card .
”
“
No , ” I said .
“
Let me clarify .   
You have a way of imprisoning the parahumans we all need gone .   
‘ Disappearing’ them .   
Fine .   
Undersiders are exempt .
”
“
Scared ?
”
Swansong asked .
“
Yeah , a bit , ” Tattletale said .   
“
Vicky has a grudge , and I would n’t one hundred percent put it past her , in a theoretical future where this worked you streamlined the process , and you had me at a disadvantage .   
Frankly , the idea of teenagers being the ones to arrest , judge , and condemn should scare anyone .   
And yes-
let me interrupt you before you get started or figure out if you ’ll say something .   
I know you ’re not making all those decisions .   
I know you have lawyers
and you ’re talking to the city .   
I also know who some of those lawyers are and the kind of people we have running the city right now .
”
That last line was punctuated by a serious look Sveta ’s way .
I saw Sveta nod slightly .
Tattletale continued , “ It ’s still scary .   
I want exemption for my people .   
If we help you here , you do n’t do that to us .
”
“ We do n’t do it to you ?
” I asked .   
I thought for a second .   
Most of the Undersiders could go in a regular jail .   
In a theoretical universe where the villain team that took over a city was well and truly arrested .   
Take Rachel away from her dogs , put Imp in a sealed cell with the right kind of monitoring , put Tattletale in jail and limit her human contact , limit Parian ’s access to materials
… I looked at the others .   
Byron nodded slightly , then switched out to Tristan , a nod .
“
Ca n’t guarantee that another team wo n’t push for it , ” I said .   
“
You meet us halfway .   
Stay out of the kind of trouble that makes people want to ‘ disappear’ you .
”
“
Okay , ” she said .   
“ You have twins and a clone on your team .   
You should know how shards map things out .
”
“ You ’re talking about agents ?   
And they use DNA .
”
“
The Corona and the tendril of shard - ness that the shard extends to the person are kind of the real - time location tracking .   
It ’s as if they ’ve got a hand on your shoulder , and if you travel halfway across the world , their hand still on your shoulder , they have an intuitive sense of where you are .   
With some exceptions and special cases in there .   
But the DNA ?   
That ’s the bar - code for the verification check .
”
“
I ’m supposed to put my DNA inside them ?
”
Rain asked .
I looked at Sveta , who was next to me , raising a hand to draw her attention to the line .   
She only nodded solemnly .
“
That sounds way more kiss than kill , ” Tristan said .
“
Huh ?
” Rain asked .
“
I ’m
pretty sure Rain does n’t like boys that much , ” Lookout said .
“
Oh , ugh , ” Rain said .   
He looked at Tristan .   
“
Um , not ugh because boy - boy , but because Cradle .
”
“ I get it .
”
“
Also , pretty sure Love Lost is twice as old as I am .
”
“ I ca n’t believe I got Capricorn ’s line before Precipice did , ” Lookout said .
Tattletale butted in , “ You ’re getting ahead of yourselves , little miss precocious especially , you ’re about three years too early to be getting that .
”
“ Two years maybe , ” Lookout said .
“
Whatever .   
Back to the subject at hand .   
Step one is confusing the signal , ” Tattletale said .   
“ Location ?   
Close proximity , for a long period of time .   
Think staying within arm
’s reach for days , even weeks .   
Probably with no interruptions , breaks , or time apart .
”
“ The Lady in Blue got one member of her cluster back and the transfer was immediate , ” I said .
“ Signal was already confused .   
The means of transferring power were already established .   
When shards kick down doors , through second triggers , some trump effects , whatever , the doors never go back to the way they were .
”
“
So step one is kidnapping someone and keeping them close for a long time , ” Rain said .
“ I can see why Foil was n’t interested , ” I said .   
“ Sleeping next to March for a long while ?
” Tattletale smiled .   
“ Step two ?   
DNA .   
When they check their paperwork and see that one person has four different powers , they check the bar - code .   
You want them to get the wrong ones and kick down the doors .   
The go - to method seems to be a blood transfusion .   
That ’s if you ’re lucky enough to be compatible .   
If you ’re not , then you can try doing the Bathory thing , go full cannibal , you can try other things to confuse the signal like borrowing skin or other tissues , or you can be patient , and hope the signal confusion occurs without you going that far , though by the time you ’ve spent weeks with someone like that , you might be ready to end it and wrap yourself in their skin , bathe in their blood instead .
”
“ Jesus , ” Tristan said .
Tattletale shrugged .   
“ Helps if you leave the other guy weak as part of what you ’re doing .   
Means they ca n’t fight it , they dwindle , and you grow comparably .
” I nodded .
“ I do n’t think I could do that to them , ” Rain said .
“
No , probably not , ” Tattletale said .   
“
But they might be willing to do it to you , and now you know what to look out for .
”
“
Thank you , ” Rain said .
“
Do n’t thank me .   
Just do n’t throw me in that alternate dimension of yours and lock the door behind you .   
And unless there ’s something more pressing … let me get my Russian nesting doll back .   
These gunshot wounds hurt enough that I ’m willing to dilute my existence down and kind of not exist .
”
There was n’t anything more pressing .   
We all had food for thought , and we had things to do .   
We left her be .
It was like a weight came off my shoulders , leaving an underground meeting with Tattletale , even though it had been a brightly - lit , high - ceilinged base of operations .
The snow was swirling around us , and the air was cold , but it was a refreshing cold .   
Below , with heaters going and a winterized costume on , I ’d been a touch on the warm side .   
Now I was finding a happy middle ground .   
I ’d probably find myself on the cold side when the light sweat chilled , but for now I was happy enough .
Our breath fogged around us , with Sveta as the exception .
“ Gregor had to go somewhere .   
Do we have a pen and paper ?
” Sveta asked .   
“
I ’d like to leave him my contact information .
”
“ I ’ve got some , ” Lookout said .   
“
My scratch pad for tinker ideas .   
Give me a second .
”
Lookout rummaged and then took dictation .   
The others joined me , leaning against a bike rack that would n’t see much use for another few months .   
Tristan in his Capricorn armor , Rain , and Swansong .
“
Deal with the devil , ” I said .
“
As the resident expert on devils , I do n’t think she ’s a devil , ” Rain said .
“
You ’re the resident expert on a lot of things , ” Tristan said .
“
Yeah ?   
I fucking earned it , ” Rain said , without any hostility in his voice .   
“
And before you get annoyed with me for going easy on her , Victoria-
”
“
I ’m not ann-
”
He did n’t stop talking , despite my interruption .   
“ -I’m also the resident expert on shitty human beings .   
And I do n’t think she ’s a great person .   
But she ’s trying in her own way .
”
“
You ’re an expert on that too , hm ?
” Swansong asked .
“
I’m- are n’t we all ?
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“ Difference is , I ’ve never known her to apologize or acknowledge the things she did .
”
Sveta joined us .   
Kenzie had run off .
I had my concerns about that- Kenzie ducking out of sight into a hive of villainy and mercenary tendencies .   
We ’d talked very recently about how tinkers were prime targets for that sort of predation , being used for their powers .
Sveta seemed to notice .   
“
She ran off as soon as I said I was done , sorry .
” I nodded .
“
What do we think ?
” Sveta asked .
I looked in the direction of the stairwell .   
“
What she said about the power dynamic ?   
I can believe most of it .   
Location and DNA ?   
It fits with things we ’ve seen before .
”
“
Things like Byron and Tristan , ” Sveta said .   
“ Proximity .
”
“ And twins and clones , ” Tristan added .   
“
Same barcode .
” Swansong nodded .
“
You said most , ” Rain said .
“
Who ? ”
Sveta asked .
“ Victoria .   
She said she could believe most of it .
”
“
She said the process works best if the person being drained is weakened .   
Bled out , skinned …
”
“ You do n’t think so ?
” Tristan asked .
“ I think it makes sense if you do n’t think about it .   
I also think that powers tend to target the disadvantaged .   
Victims .   
Trigger events target them .   
Second triggers do .   
When your power fluctuates because you ’re in a mindset aligned to your trigger ?   
It ’s rewarding that mentality .
”
“ Tattletale misled ?
” Sveta asked .
“
Or she was wrong ,
” Tristan said .   
“
How sure are you , Vic ?
” I had to think about it .   
“ Fifty percent .
”
“
That ’s not helpful , ” Sveta chided me .   
“
That ’s the opposite of helpful .
”
“ If we ever find ourselves in a position to consider doing that , we should be aware of the risk .   
Weakening one person risks a second trigger , and it might work the opposite way .
”
“
Great , ” Rain said .
“
There ’s an upside !
”
Sveta said , encouraging .   
“ If they get you … you kind of have a chance , whatever they do ?
”
Rain snorted .
From the stairwell , Lookout emerged .   
She had Chicken Little with her , as well as Whippersnap and the lace girl .   
I could see the defensive body language in the two case fifty - threes .   
Whippersnap folded his arms , while the lace girl stepped a bit behind him .   
Her hand found Whippersnap ’s .
“
… shot a target and all of the smashed - up bullets came out looking like birds , ” Chicken Little said .
“
That ’s crazy .   
But you know , that ’s a trick of the eye sometimes .   
Like when you look at a cloud and it looks like something ?   
I remember when I was really young , in those good old days when you were automatically friends with whoever was the same age ?
”
“
Yeah , ” Chicken Little said .   
“
I remember those days .
”
“
Yeah !   
So we were pulling bits of concrete away from this ruined wall with cracks running through it , and every single piece had a pattern in the broken side that looked like a face .   
That ’s the effect I ’m talking about .   
I experimented with it , when I was working on my cameras .
”
“ I think I have one of the bullets in my pocket .   
It ’s sharp
so it ’s sometimes useful .   
Here .
”
Chicken Little reached into the front pocket of the coat that had been built into his costume-
it had tails at the back like an old fashioned coat , but the tails had a feather - like cut to them , like a bird
’s folded wings .   
His mask was full - face , with beady black eyes set fairly low , in a way that made the forehead and the crest at the top stand out more .
He produced a bullet , like a soft slug pried out of a wall or floor , or out of a bullet - proof vest .   
Sure enough , it had broken up into a shape that looked a hell of a lot like a robin in flight , the splits separating head from wing and wing from tail .
“
Oh wow .   
That really does look like a bird .
”
“
So do all the others .   
If I catch her going to the range again I ’ll see if she can do another .
”
“ Or other things , ” Lookout said .
“
Oh yeah !   
Like an elephant !   
I like elephants .
”
“
Imagine if you controlled elephants .   
That ’d be nuts .
”
“ I could n’t , though .   
They ’d get hurt and that would suck .   
Aunt Rachel
’s
dogs get hurt or die a lot
and it sucks .
”
“ Aunt Rachel ?
”
“ Bitch , or Hellhound , but she does n’t have a secret identity ,
obviously- ”
“
Nonono , obviously .   
Yes , I know her name and everything , I get it .   
I just blanked .
”
“ Chicken , ” Whippersnap said .   
“
We should let them go .   
They ’re waiting and they have things to do .
”
With eyes that bulged out , each looking like there was too much moisture inside them , to the point they were n’t quite round anymore , he still managed to glare .
“
Okay , ” Chicken Little said .
“ You ’re lucky that you have people around your age to hang out with here , ” Kenzie said .
“ Maybe you could come here and hang out sometime , and-
”
There were noises of protest , muted and not , from more than a few corners .   
Whippersnap was louder .   
Sveta , Ashley and I were at different places on the spectrum of dissuading and the more logical pointing out of issues .
“ -or not , ” Chicken Little said .
“ Security issues , ” Whippersnap said .   
“
And we ’ve heard enough about her to know
she ’s a walking infosec breach .
”
I really liked how the young teen was using words like ‘ infosec’ .   
The company we keep .
A bummer , that Kenzie could n’t meet up with a potential friend .
“
Maybe neutral territory , ”
I said .
Whippersnap ’s focus seemed to remain primarily on Sveta .
“
What ’s your name ?
”
Swansong , addressing the lace girl .
“
Does it matter ?
” Whippersnap asked .   
“
What do you care ?
” Swansong shrugged .   
“
I just like the dress .   
It ’s pretty , and I ’m a fan of the style .
”
As if to indicate , Swansong ’s fingers brushed against her own skirt .   
White fabric , like the lace girl seemed to be covered in .   
Swansong only had a bit of lace , though .
The lace girl nodded , lips set into a firm line behind her veil .   
Her hands looked like they ’d been covered in gloves , then had the lace pattern punched in repeatedly , passing through glove and flesh both .   
Most of her looked that way , and the parts that did n’t just had extra layers , with only hints of it .
“
When a case fifty - three ca n’t choose their appearance , pointing out even the parts you like about how they ended up can be disconcerting , ” Sveta murmured .
“
Sorry then , ” Swansong said .
“ I did make it myself , ”
the lace girl said .   
“
Most of it .   
Thank you for liking it .   
I ’m Chantilly .
”
“ Swansong . ”
Chantilly smiled slightly .
Whippersnap shielded her with his body , as if we had guns and she was in danger .   
He looked at Chicken .   
“ Come on .   
You should go downstairs .   
You ’re a target too .   
Tilly , let ’s go .
”
I saw Lookout start to take a step forward , then stop herself , rocking back on her heels .   
I put a hand on her shoulder .
“
Hold on , ” Swansong said .
The trio stopped .
“
Do any of you want to share emails , phones ?   
So you can see about the meeting on neutral ground ?
”
Chantilly shook her head , quickly .
“ I will , ” Chicken Little said .
I could see Whippersnap ’s active impatience , as Chicken Little wrote down a number or email on Lookout ’s scratch pad .
As soon as he was done , he was ushered away along with Chantilly , Whippersnap continuing to be protective , shielding the lace girl from us as if from a physical danger .
“
I know your rules say you ca n’t ask or push contact on people , ” Swansong said .
Lookout nodded .   
“
I wanted to so badly .
”
“
It ’s good
you made a friend .   
That looked like a good conversation .
”
“ I did n’t talk too much ?   
Or say anything weird ?
”
“ Nah , ” Tristan said , from the side .   
He looked at me .   
“ We should go .
” I nodded .   
“
Things to do .
”
The snow continued to fall , done its frenzied dance higher above , where our proximity to various portals and the weather they stirred up made the snow travel in wild courses .
“
How do you feel about going after your friends ?
” Tristan asked .
“
Friends ?
”
Rain asked .
“ Swansong , going after the members of Love Lost .   
If that ’s what we end up doing .
”
“
It ’ll be nice to see them again .   
Nicer to show them what I ’m made of .
”
“ That simple , huh ? ”
“ Not simple , but I like where I am .
”
“ I like where you are too , ” Lookout said .   
“
And I like that Chantilly liked you too .   
The white dress comes with its upsides , huh ?
”
The conversation continued .   
Tristan asking Lookout if she had a map , so we could find her family ’s van .   
She had a tracking chip inside it .   
Because of course .
Tristan swapped out for Byron , because Rain had asked a question , and I heard my name , a ‘ Vicky’ tossed into it – a question aimed at Byron .   
On answering , Byron swapped out , and Tristan said something about how quick that had been .
My focus was more on Sveta , who was staring off down a side street .
“ Sveta , ” Tristan said .
“
Hm ?
”
“
What do you think ?   
Love Lost ?
”
“ We can .   
We ’ve fought a lot of them before .
”
“ Tonight , you think ?   
Or do we plan more ?
”
“
I ’m fine with whatever .   
Weld gets back super late .   
Crystal too ?
” I nodded .
“
It would be nice to tell him we scored a big win .
”
“ Tonight then , ” Tristan said .
“
Okay , ” Sveta said .   
She looked off to the side again .
“ See something ?
” I asked .   
I saw the mild surprise on her face .   
Before she could answer , I said .   
“ Come on .   
We ’ll check it out .   
If we ’re being followed , it ’s important to know .
”
“ Do you need help ?
”
Swansong asked .
I shook my head .   
“
Stay put , or go to the van and wait there .   
Keep an eye out .
”
At the nod , I took Sveta ’s hand , and I pulled her along with .   
She used her tendrils , reaching out and grabbing things , hauling herself further down the way .
Once she was on a rooftop , she waited for me .
I looked back at the others , who were smaller in this new perspective .
“
Come on .   
We ’ll loop around .
”
“
I did n’t see anything .
”
I brought her along with .   
She gripped my arm and in the doing she held my injured hand .
We stopped on another rooftop .
“ I thought we could use a break , ” I said .   
“ Get away .
”
I saw her expression shift slightly .   
The slip , the facade going back up .
“
I ’m sorry that sucked .   
Whippersnap .   
Chantilly .
”
“ I barely knew him .   
He was a kid in the group .   
But he was supposed to be like a brother to me .   
Like how he said brother Gregor .
” I nodded .   
“
Yeah .
”
“
He was supposed to be mine , not possessive or anything …
but they ’re the only family I get
and I do n’t get to have them .
”
The facade slipped away .
“ And Chantilly ,
yeah .
”
“
Yeah !   
Fuck ! ”
Sveta said , angry .
“
Fuck , ” she said , sad .
I hugged her , and she buried her face in the crook of my neck , mumbling now that she was talking into cloth .   
“
She wears a white dress and that gets her points with Chantilly , but I ’m the outsider ?   
I ’m the odd one out ?   
What the fuck .
”
Yep .   
Better that the anger get out now than in a release of bottled - up feelings .   
Especially when we were going up against an emotion manipulator .
I had tears in my own eyes , now , just listening .
“
And she shows off her hands ?   
I ’m happy for her
, I really am ,
I ’m not
that much of a bitch that I would n’t be , really .   
I ’m sorry .
”
“
You ’re not a bitch at all , ” I said .
“
But she ’s smug and showing off about how they ’re practically indistinguishable from regular ones and what the fuck ! ”








Video played on our laptop , a cartoon animation of a beautiful woman with black skin , dreadlocks , yellow stick - on nails , and a canary yellow boa in a tropical paradise .   
A skinny guy with rings of tribal tattoos on his arm and ‘ DJ’ on his bicep sat with his arm around a curvy young woman in a bikini , with sharks tattooed at her sides .
Every character was stylized , to the point it could be hard to keep track .
“
Who ’s that ?
”
I asked , pointing at a guy in the background .   
“
Were we introduced to him ?
”
“
We saw him in the background earlier .   
He was putting the gun on the jeep , ” Rain said .   
Rain wore the trinket at his neck , which changed his appearance to the scruffier , dark - haired alternate look .   
He sat with a similarly disguised Sveta and me on a curved couch , his boots resting on his bag , which was on the quarter - circle shaped table in front of us .   
The couch and table setup were one of twenty - five , each arranged
so it was a rotation from nearby tables and couches , placed in the lounge area of a larger building .
The building was something of a hybrid : a dining hall , library , social area , and market all in one .   
At this end of the greater building , the smells and noise of the food court were muted by an intervening bottleneck .   
On the floors above , I could see the bookshelves of the library .   
Individual chairs , beanbags , and study nooks were up there , away from the light conversation of the lounge floor .
Twenty - five tables on the ground floor , a crowd , and then two floors of library on three sides , a wall of thick glass on the fourth side .   
Circular lights high above us glowed blue , pumping out the UV light .
This was Lyme Center .   
When the last winter had rolled around , things had been bad .   
Suicides had peaked as the winter went long , and isolation had been a part of that .   
Being cold and hungry was one thing .   
Being cold , hungry , and alone ?   
The inorganic way that so much of the Megalopolis had sprung up had led to whole groups and clusters of people in isolated pockets being left with no contact with other people .   
There had been places where people could gather that had been crammed with those seeking human contact from dawn until well after dark , and there had been places where there just had n’t been anywhere to go and talk to other human beings that were n’t neighbors .
Lyme had been a tent city a month ago , and past the big windows of Lyme Center the construction was continuing well past sundown .   
Snow , bright yellow construction vehicles , and dark skeletons of pre - fabricated buildings being put together .   
No plumbing , not in the original sense , just fat tubes set into ditches just deep enough that gravel and dirt could be piled over top and packed down .
“
What show ?
” a guy asked , leaning over the back of the couch .   
He looked twenty - five or so , and from his jacket and the bag he had slung over his shoulder , he had the look of a tent - city denizen who had n’t quite let his guard down .
Not so different from a homeless person who kept everything they valued within arm ’s reach .
“ Blood Atoll , ” Sveta said , adjusting her headphones so the one was n’t covering her left ear .
“ Never heard of it .   
Seeing people in bikinis is making me wish I was someplace warmer
, I ’m not sure I could stand to watch that .
” Rain chuckled .
“
Is it good ?
”
“
We ’re not far enough in to know , ” Rain said .   
He hit the pause button .   
The scene had the woman with the boa looming over ‘ Parker’ , the youngest person in the house .
“
I ’m dying for something to watch .   
Is it in the catalogue ?
”
“
Offworld French animation , ” Rain said .   
“
It might go in the catalogue if we can figure out how to convert the video file types .
”
“
That ’s always a nightmare .   
But if you upload it straight , it can be emulated .
”
I leaned back , “
We talked to a few people about it and got different answers each time .   
Some people do n’t like how messy it gets .   
If it sucks it might not even be worth the hassle .
”
“ Odd animation .   
Rotoscope ?
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .
An icon was flashing yellow on the laptop .   
Rain cycled out of the window and into another one .   
A simple video game , with two towns , each with a nine by nine grid on it , each icon on the grid having a series of buildings .   
Hospital , house , farm , carpenter ’s , and police .
Rain centered the laptop across his knees , clicked on the house , cycling through images until a frowning old lady appeared , peering over the little fence .   
A series of red ‘ -100’ and ‘ -200’ popped up in neighboring zones .
Above the other town , a face like the one I ’d seen drawn on Kenzie
’s whiteboard popped up – a circular face with only eyes and mouth , brown skinned , black hair parted with two buns , contained within a speech balloon .   
Her eyes closed into half - circles , mouth wide in a smile that took up half of the circle .   
A thumbs - up icon followed .
I was n’t a hundred percent sure I followed the logic of the coding system , but Rain seemed to .   
I could get the general sense of it though .   
In the other town , there was a police officer shouting at someone outside of the police station , curse words in the speech balloon .
I pointed at it .   
“
She ’s
okay ?   
No points lost ?
”
“
Random event , ” Rain said .   
“
They ’re fine .   
She ’s still ahead by … seven quintillion points .   
Literally .
” I looked over my shoulder .   
There were police officers and people in patrol uniforms wandering Lyme Center .   
The nooks and reading areas were regularly visited .
In ‘ our’ town , the police were just walking around their one - ninth of the grid .
The guy who had been watching our screen over our shoulders walked away .   
Rain finished typing out a message , fixed the orientation of the laptop , and resumed the video .   
He leaned back and took the ear bud from my hand , sitting closer as he put it in .
On the screen , ‘ Parker’ was throwing a fit .   
The woman with the boa took it unflinching , until the first few objects were scooped up from the nearby cabinet and thrown .
We had two audio jacks plugged into the laptop .   
Sveta had a hair of headphones .   
Since I was sharing the ear - buds with Rain , I had audio only in the one ear , which was fine with me , since it let me keep an ear on our surroundings .
In my right ear , Parker ’s swears matched up with the subtitles on the screen .
“ Shit , ” Sveta said , with a serious expression on the face she wore as camouflage .
The thrown objects marked the point it stopped being a teenager ’s tantrum and became something else .   
The lady with the boa gripped the edge of the counter , staring Parker down .   
Others stood from their seats .
‘
Fuck you and suck on frozen shit , you act like you ’re all that , but you ’re a mess !   
I ca n’t believe I actually looked up to you for a minute there!’
‘ She gave you a place to live.’    This from D.J .. ‘
She gave me fucking slavery !   
I joined up to have fun !   
I wanted to drink and fucking actually do shit
and instead I ’m your bitch !   
I ’m
done!’    
‘ You can always leave,’ the girl with the shark tattoos running from armpit to waist said .   
‘ We wo n’t get in your way.’ ‘ Nicky might,’ D.J. said .
‘ Nicky is n’t here,’ Shark girl said .   
‘ If you ’re gon na leave , now ’s good.’ Parker swayed on the spot , as if leaning hard enough to one side could be the motivation to go .   
She looked at the woman with the feather boa and then immediately looked away .   
‘ Can I collect my pay?’ The woman with the feather boa shook her head slowly .
‘ If you leave , you leave all the money you ’ve earned on the table,’ D.J. said .
Parker became visibly agitated at that .
“ Walk away , ” Sveta murmured under her breath .
Parker did n’t .
“
Do we intervene ?
”
Sveta asked , quiet .
“
What we ’re watching is out of date , ” I said .   
“
We ’re … six minutes behind on the broadcast , because we keep pausing .
”
We were only free to pause because the other group was staying current .   
Rain skipped ahead , catching us up .   
Visual glitches muddled the screen .   
As it resolved , the squares and blocks of text falling away , Parker could be seen in the kitchen , cleaning up , downcast .
Rain flipped backward a bit , giving us one - frame glimpses of the outcome .   
Parker subdued , resuming her work in the kitchen .   
A few seconds before , we had Parker with a stricken expression on her face .   
A moment before that , ‘ Nicky’ was at the door .
Played in the right order , ‘ Nicky’ had come back , and the fight had gone out of Parker .
Of course , Parker was just a superimposed image .   
Nicky was n’t a tanned blonde with cornrows at either side of her face .   
D.J. was n’t a surfer dude , the girl with the shark bite tattoos was n’t his side chick , and the woman with the boa was n’t the silent leader of the group of pirates .
Love Lost had settled here in Lyme .   
We had some surveillance , but positioning ourselves was a task .   
Ninety percent of everything that was n’t part of the old tent city was under construction .   
The other ten percent was like this
– crowded , patrolled , and potentially monitored by moles and agents in league to Love Lost .
We ’d tried to set up and operate out of the van , where our supplies were in easy reach and our team was together .   
We ’d struggled to find a parking spot in the happy medium between being close enough to Love Lost to act , and far enough away to avoid attention .   
Within two minutes , we ’d had police knocking on the door of the van .   
Every spot was pre - claimed or , as we ’d been told , subject to the whims of the construction teams that were moving large amounts of material through .
Our attempt to get out of the van and set up somewhere as a team had been similarly stymied .   
With that , and after seeing just how closely monitored and claustrophobic the emerging community was here in Lyme , I was prepared to give Love Lost some credit .
She ’d either been insanely lucky to stumble onto a location like this , or she ’d had the sense to find it .   
I was betting on the latter .
Our only options had seemed to be setting up in the next area over , with a twenty minute travel time to get here if we needed to do something , or setting up close and dealing with constant hassle , with civilians peering over our shoulder and potentially reporting back to Love Lost .
Except Kenzie had had an idea .   
Old programs .   
One to superimpose images , and another that let her tech put the game together based on a description .   
We ’d watched for ten minutes before the game popped up in a mostly working fashion .
“
What do we know about her ?
” I asked .   
I reached forward and hit the arrow keys , since there was n’t a lot happening on - screen .   
I stopped when we had an image on the woman with the canary feather boa on screen .
“ Heavy question , ” Rain said .   
“
She ’s angry , but I think most people picked up on that .
”
“ Silent , ” Sveta said .
“ Nearly silent , ” Rain agreed , nodding .   
“
She was law enforcement .   
Detective , I ’m pretty sure .   
I saw a flashback where she won an award , her daughter was in the audience .   
So I think she was a pretty good one .   
I remember , uh , another flashback , she had a child , but her child died .   
Was killed .   
Senselessly .
” The sentences were more fragmented as he went .   
I saw him clench his fist , white - knuckled , before wrapping his other hand around it and cracking the knuckles manually , his eyes on the screen .
“
And she turned into a … pirate ?
”
I asked , mindful that people might overhear .   
“
Using all of that expert knowledge from her past life ?
”
“
Something like that , ” Rain said .   
“
The vicious anger is a running theme .   
Anger at the criminals , anger at her ex .   
She drank .   
She seems to avoid it now , which I find a bit surprising .
”
“
How was she with her child ?
” Sveta asked .
Rain resumed the video , then skipped forward and backward a bit , looking .
It was a point we ’d paused the video before , when the guy with the overloaded pack had interrupted .   
The woman with the canary feather boa looming over ‘ Parker’ .   
With the scene , someone ’s
voice from the background was represented on screen with the subtitles .   
‘ … do n’t want to step into the ring here , Colt honey.’
As the word ‘ Colt’ came through the earbud , it was auto - changed to Parker on the screen , in the subtitles .   
Colt was the kid from Cedar Point who had been roped into joining Prancer ’s group as a henchman .   
She ’d apparently been there when Kenzie ’s place had been raided and Natalie had been hurt .
Rain seemed to want the image to stand for itself .   
Our painted - over picture showed Love Lost leaning forward , staring down Colt .   
No words , only intimidation .
“
Angry ?
” I suggested .
“
Messy , I guess , ” Rain said .   
“
Does it matter how she was with her kid ?   
Because I think she loved her child with all her being .   
Does n’t that count for something ?
” Sveta frowned .   
“
I ’m so tired of dealing with parents like K ’s , Vic ’s , and now this mess .
”
“
I ca n’t really comment , ” Rain ’s voice had dropped , almost like he was falling away , but his gaze was intently fixed on the face on the screen .   
“
Nobody deserves to go through what she went through .   
What she ’s going through , every minute of every day .   
She ’s carrying that now , while she ’s dealing with , uh , Parker .
”
“ Do you need to sit this one out ?
” I asked .
“
Before , I had pretty strong feelings , but I could think about the big picture .   
Now that I ’m closer , the feelings are bigger , and I think the feelings are winning .   
Ask me again later ?
” I nodded .
That did n’t make the situation any easier .   
If Rain sat this one out , then we had Sveta and I as part of this group , and Swansong , Capricorn , and Lookout as part of the other group .
Love Lost had more capes than that , and she was entrenched in this area .   
This was her turf .
We could call others in , but they would face the same problem we did .   
There were n’t any good places for capes to lurk .   
Set up too far away , and response times would suffer .   
Get too close , and they could be spotted .
I had my phone .   
It was n’t camouflaged like the feed on the laptop was , but I was reasonably sure that whatever I browsed would be dismissed as idle reading , provided
I scrolled past images quickly enough .
I sent a message to Advance Guard .   
They had some people with mobility who could swoop in .
The icon on the screen flashed , indicating that the ‘ game’ had updated .
It was the little Kenzie face in the speech balloon , with no smile .   
Eyes wide .   
An Ashley face was laughing with a hand in front of the mouth , the ‘ ha ha ha’ floating away .   
Tristan ’s face popped up , green and barfing a thin stream that pooled on the roof of the building below the speech bubble .
Rain went back to the video feed and caught us up to the present , where a faint arrow indicated what the other team was watching .
‘ … between my teeth and cheek .   
For an hour , hunh ?   
Whaddyasay?’   
Sidepiece . 
 
‘ Why ’d you have to say teeth like that ?   
Teeth are ten kinds of fuck no.’    D.J. ‘ Not even a nibble?’ ‘ Never a nibble !   
Never!’ ‘ I ’ve known people who liked being nibbled on and nipped.’ ‘ You know fucked up people , Side.’ ‘
What if I tucked it somewhere safe and warm instead , hmmm ?   
We could go catch a movie , and then I ’ll give it back .   
How fun would that be?’ On the screen
, Sidepiece cozied up to D.J.    He seemed to accept the cozying , but said , ‘ Safe and warm for you is an inch from nitroglycerin for me.’ Sidepiece made a sound that was about fifty percent snort , forty percent nasal snort overlapping the first , and ten percent laugh .
‘
I ’m attached to it,’ D.J. said .
‘ Detach it .   
I want it to play with for a while .   
We could have so much
fun.’
On the other window , Kenzie was marked as away , a candy emote over her head .   
Going to get snacks , while Sidepiece and D.J. potentially got R - rated ?   
Tristan was with her .
Rain hit a key and the subtitles disappeared .   
I saw him glance back and looked out of the corner of my eye .   
A guy in a uniform that could have been a security guard or cop was standing off to the side , looking in our direction .
‘ You ’ll lose it.’ ‘ Nuh uh.’ ‘ I ’ve seen you lose your keys , your favorite top- ‘ ‘ That shit was stolen , no fair.’ ‘ -your phone , twice , your banking card- ‘ ‘ I was really drunk when I lost the card.’ ‘ -your pancreas.’ ‘ Grows back!’ ‘ Slowly!’ ‘ But it grows back !   
And I did n’t lose it exactly , okay ! ?   
I had a snowfort pile going , y’know?’ ‘ What the fuck is a snowfort
pile?’ ‘ What the kids do with snowballs , all stacked up neat and ready to throw ?   
And then the ground shook and rattled the table , and it all blew .   
Ovaries are such cluster - fuckers , all loaded up with those eggs .   
I did pretty fuckin’ good finding as many of the pieces as I did.’ ‘ You lose shit , Side .   
Admit it!’ 
  ‘ No !   
I had reasons and other shit going on !   
I ’m not going to get carelessly drunk
if you give me a toy to play with!’ ‘ That ’s what you do every day !   
Toys and drugs and drunk!’
The two started play wrestling on the couch in their
…
I was n’t sure if it was a headquarters or home .   
The tropical overlay did mask some essential details .   
There was a key to make the overlay drop away , but that risked letting bystanders see the feed .
Spright and Shortcut were on their way .   
Shortcut was n’t my first choice , but I was n’t about to look this horse in the mouth .
Colt was in the next room , though she might as well have been in the same room as the frisky pair , because the wall that separated kitchen from the living room space had a massive window in it that things could be passed through .
Love Lost was moving .   
On the screen , the lady with the feather boa was pulling on a light jacket .   
The camera zoomed in as she slid something up her sleeves , attaching it to her wrists .
Claws .
“ Going to battle , ” I said .
Rain used his feet to pick up his bag , dropped it a bit , then got it on the second try , passing it to his hands .
Love Lost snapped her fingers .   
All activity on the ground floor stopped – which amounted to ‘ Parker’ , Sidepiece as the girl with the shark - bite tattoos , and D.J ..
“
Do you need us ?
” Sidepiece asked .
Love Lost indicated Colt .
“ We ’re going out ?
”
Colt asked .
“
Yeah , ” Nicky said , as she came down the stairs .   
She grabbed her own top and hat .   
“
It ’s a meeting .   
Bring everything .
”
“
So long as it ’s not washing dishes , ” Colt said , sullen .
The scene on the screen shifted , the camera pulling away .   
It gave us an overhead view of the ‘ Blood Atoll’
– a ring of beach with a pirate bay contained within .   
Other lenses on the camera began to pull up scenes and things of interest .   
One dominant picture was of the jeep beside Love
Lost
’s headquarters .   
A machine gun was mounted on top , covered with a tarp , an x - ray image showing the loose position of the gun .
I looked around to make sure nobody was staring at our screen , and reached over for the key combination , checking with Rain and Sveta that I was good to go .   
They did their own check before nodding .
Just a second .
The Atoll became Lyme , the dirt from where ground had been flattened out forming the ring around the exterior , construction ongoing , the layout of boat and beach became building and snow layered over dirt and rock .
The jeep with the machine gun was now a truck , and instead of a machine gun , it was something tinker - made .   
The tinker leaned against the side of the vehicle , smoking .   
He did wear a mask , soft with goggles built in , a spike of metal extending from the connecting piece between the two goggles , up the forehead , and arcing back over the head , giving a silver line to the part in his greasy , copper - colored hair .   
The mask did n’t cover his throat , and I could see the hair there , almost an unbroken line from neck to collarbone to chest hair .   
He wore a heavy flannel shirt , a workman ’s jacket , winterized work gloves , and jeans .   
Low - key as tinkers went .
Other scenes showed our position .   
The hourglass - shaped Lyme Center had Kenzie , Swansong , and Tristan in the noisier area .   
On the other side of the bottleneck was us , marked with tinted dots .   
Yellow - white for me , green - blue for Sveta , and dark red for Rain .
Love Lost , Colt , and Nailbiter stepped outside ,
Nailbiter distorting into her narrow form to stab the upper half of her body into the backseat before the seat was even moved forward to let people back there .   
Her lower body was withdrawn in , narrowing and disappearing into the space .   
Colt climbed in normally , before pulling the seat back to its normal position to let Love Lost in .
There were graphical glitches as the program struggled to come up with ways to coordinate the very different vehicle types .
The tinker drove , with Love Lost in the front seat .
“
We could intercept , ” Sveta whispered , leaning in close .   
Rain leaned in to hear , and we had a huddle .
“ Against an unknown gun ?   
The four of them ?
”
Rain whispered back .
“
We have two Advance Guard guys on the way , ” I whispered .   
“ Spright and Shortcut .
”
“ Ew .
”
Sveta made a face .   
“ Not my favorite person .
”
“
They ’re quick enough to get involved when we need involved , ” I said .   
Rather than use the laptop , I pulled out my phone .   
Time to make sure everyone was in the loop .
Tracking Love Lost ’s group to unspecified meeting .   
They ’re armed for a fight .   
Known violence in records , two of the four people en route are on our list of major threats to the city .   
AG sending two to assist .   
I punched the short description of our activities into my phone and sent the message .
Database back at headquarters notified .   
We were in the system , and other heroes knew what we were doing .
Capricorn , Lookout , and Swansong were ready .
Spright and Shortcut were at the very edges of Lyme .
Two more bases to cover .   
The first went into a much cruder queue .   
The icon switched rapidly between ‘ sending’ , ‘ sent’ , ‘ queued’ , and then ‘ read’ .
We got a message back .   
‘
What are their names’ .   
No question mark .
Nailbiter and Love Lost .
‘ Not going to say no .   
Be safe – Nat.’
My eyebrows went up .   
Was she back ?   
Or did she decide to get involved ?
The second to last was n’t as smooth .   
The ‘ loading’ symbol played over the final bar , which was simply labeled ‘ Wardens’ .   
The option grayed out , a line struck through it .   
Then it shifted .   
A crown icon .
A crown for a monarch ?   
An emperor ?   
It was uncomfortable , but I doubted Kenzie had put that much thought into things .
Doubly uncomfortable that they knew what we were doing now .
Citrine or one of her employees sent their reply .   
Permission given .   
Good , to meet the self - imposed requirement of a thumbs - up from the higher - ups .   
Negative , on so many levels , that the higher - ups were who they were .
“ The others want to meet up .   
They ’re heading our way , since we ’re closer to the car , ” Rain said .
“ They ’re packed up and moving already , ” I said .
“
All energy and forward momentum .
”   
Rain smiled .
“
What do you think ?
”
I asked him .   
“
Any doubts ?
”
He did n’t have an immediate response for me .
“
It ’s okay to say no .
”
“
I’m- ” Rain started .   
A group of people walked right behind the couch , one of them holding a bag that brushed
Rain ’s head .   
Sveta ’s head craned around a bit more than a head should , studying the people .   
She dismissed them as normal .
“
I ’m thinking of how Ashley apparently backed off , the other night .   
She said she did n’t want to do the one thing , she knew she was bad at it
and it was bad for her .
”
“
Yeah .
”
“ I respect that .   
I ’d want to do that if I was more sure about anything .   
I ’m pretty sure the three of us that are left are going to kill each other .
”   
The last few words were whispered .
“
But ?
” I asked .
“
But I also feel pretty sure that if I do n’t stop her , she ’s going to hurt other people .   
I know her pretty well by now .
”
The other three members of the group were at the second floor stage , looking down .   
They started the walk around to the stairs .
“
Should we pack up ?
”
Rain asked , hand on the lid of the laptop .
“
Wait , ” Sveta said .   
“ Look .
”
It was the cartoon overlay of things , showing the truck .   
Heading to the Lyme Center .
At the back of the truck , the roof and side had been slid away , revealing the gun within .   
The gun was lighting up , crackling with electricity , and slowly swiveling .   
Aiming at the camera .
My head snapped around to Lookout .   
She was at the top of the stairs , oblivious .   
I raised a hand , trying to get her attention .
“ Shit , ” Rain said .
She was too enamored with Ashley , chattering up a storm .   
Tristan had a hand out to make sure she was n’t going to fall down the stairs , but he was n’t looking at us either .
Phone out , I started to type .   
I knew it would be too slow .
“ Powers ?
” I whispered .
Rain shook his head .   
At the same time , Sveta stood up .   
Her fingers , appearing like skin with the projector image that was on her , fumbled for and found her anchor necklace .   
She worked at the dial on the back .
“ Sveta ?
” I asked .
“
Please work , ” she said , one hand gripping the wrist of her other arm .
The hand of that arm flickered and moved in a slightly out - of - sync way , before closing into a fist .
Above Sveta , I saw a line flash out , briefly appearing .   
One tendril , loosed to reach out .   
Aimed not at any person , but at- at the metal of the railing closest to our heads .   
It struck with a force that made a sharp ‘ tang’ noise , followed by a duller echo of the same sound .
Anyone that had looked or seen would have seen just the briefest instance of the tendril going out and in-
and it looked like she ’d arced it well overhead , using the cloak and prevention of her necklace
’s setting .
Nobody was shouting ‘ parahuman , parahuman , danger!’ – there were no shrieks .   
Only people on the stairwell and near the railing who looked concerned , like the metal might fail as something came loose .
And we had the group ’s attention .   
I indicated the laptop , and Lookout whipped out her phone .
Quick enough to see , too late to do anything .
The lights in the Lyme Center flickered and dimmed for a moment .   
The laptop we ’d been using went black .   
From the look of Lookout ’s reaction , she ’d just lost her phone .
She ’d have lost her last good flying camera , too .
People were still reacting to the sudden motion and the sound .   
Slowly , they settled , looking a little less at ease than before .   
Heads periodically looked skyward ,    as if assuming that some wire or cable had ripped loose and then been reeled in .
No eyes on us .
“ Relax , ” I said .   
“ Take it easy .   
We draw more attention to ourselves by freaking out .
”
Lookout , on the stairs , was clearly upset , all but stamping her feet in impotent anger .
“
She has an emotion sense , ” Rain said .   
“ If she comes here , she ’ll sense our emotions .
”
“ All the more reason to relax , take it easy , ” I said .   
“
Everyone here is a bit emotional .
”
“
I can guarantee you that I ’m in the top two percent here .   
I have some pretty strong regrets when it comes to how things happened .
”
There was no more way to tell how far away Love Lost was .   
The camera and laptop were dead .
The other three were still near the top of the stairs .   
I motioned for them to hang back , and then turned my eyes and my attention to the tunnel that led from the second floor of this half of the hourglass - shaped Center to the second floor of the other half .
Make sure you have an escape route .
We had our stuff packed and ready to go , the escape routes in mind .   
Above us and to our left , Kenzie , Tristan , and a disguised Ashley were leaning against the railing , looking out over the lounge and social area .   
The center of the hourglass and the passage to the other side were right behind them .
Love Lost arrived in civilian clothes .   
Her tinker had stayed behind .   
She wore a coat with a velvety texture , ankle - length and tailored to fit her figure , drawing in at the waist and then drawing in slightly from the hips .   
Her winter boots had platform heels , and I could see traces of metal along the boots .   
Claws ready to deploy .
I had snacks in my bag that I ’d saved in case we ’d ended up doing an outdoor stakeout or surveillance from the van .   
I found a bag of chips and opened it , sharing out the contents .
“
What are you doing ?
” Sveta asked .
“
Acting normal , ” I said .   
“
Do n’t stare .
”
Rain bit down on a chip .
Love Lost , Colt , and Nailbiter were weaving their way across the floor .   
Love Lost whispered something to Nailbiter , with Colt in earshot .   
Immediately , the other two started peering over the crowd more intently .
They knew we were here .   
They ’d planned for the camera- no doubt because they knew how we ’d operated in Cedar Point .   
She ’d studied what we brought to the table and recruited a counter to Lookout .
Does a detective ’s awareness of their environment and an emotion - senser ’s
ability let her pick us out from a crowd with any effectiveness ?
I was trusting no , extrapolating from how Dean had described things .   
I was trusting that if it came down to it
and she did see us , then they would n’t try too hard to get us .   
This was their territory , and as much as they seemed willing to shit where they ate , I had to assume that they would n’t slaughter the people in their own neck of the woods .
“ Why is this working ?
”
Rain asked .
“ Emotional soup .   
There might be enough people here that feel just as awful as you do .
”
“
Really .
”
I looked out over the crowd .   
“ Only takes five or six .
”
Love Lost found the people she wanted to talk to .   
It was maybe the biggest collection of people in the lounge area .   
With twenty - five seats , they had members of their group split across five or six .   
Right beneath Kenzie , Tristan , and Ashley , who peered down from the second floor railing .   
It might have been the third floor on another building
’s layout , but this center had been built tall , open , and grand , so it might feel less claustrophobic in the midst of a harsh , hungry winter .
The anti - parahuman citizens having a face to face meeting with Love Lost .   
Pretty clear that they knew what she was , because they seemed pretty stone - faced until Colt arrived , acting as an interpreter or representative .
“
They might have faced the facts and realized where they stand ,
” I murmured , before turning my eyes back to my chip bag .   
“
They ’re
anti - parahuman , but there ’s a limit to what humans can do .   
They might be hiring help .
”
Love Lost took a seat .   
Colt was doing the talking , of course .   
Nailbiter hung back .   
The enforcer in this situation .
“
Why ?
”
Rain asked .   
“
Something big ? ”








We were on a villain ’s turf and I was getting a sense of what that meant , as I marked face after face that now seemed serious and focused enough that they seemed to grasp what was going on .
A pair of officers in uniform had been keeping the peace in the place , patrolling and watching out for trouble , telling the occasional person to go outside to smoke , or grilling twenty - somethings about what they were drinking .   
Now , for lack of a better way of putting it , they were standing guard , both a set distance from
Love Lost ’s meeting with the anti - parahuman guys .
They were n’t watching Love Lost , but they were watching the anti - parahuman group .   
One stood in the middle of a walkway , which meant that a group of people who were getting up from a table had to walk the long way around , instead of cutting right past the talk in progress .
There were others I was less sure about .   
A pair of people like the guy who ’d butted in and asked about ‘ Blood Atoll’ were milling around now , with an aura like they owned the place … or like they were working for the person who did .
“
In the game we were playing , ” Rain said .   
“ I do n’t think we got to it , but there ’s a second stage , right ?   
The monster ?
”
“
We talked about it briefly , ” I said .   
“
I did n’t pick up on all of it .   
I figured I ’d learn by doing , or let you guys do it .
”
“ I was always more of the gamer , ” Sveta said .
I nodded .
“ We ’re managing our little town , nine by nine grid , then the monster strikes , ” Rain explained .   
Even wearing a projection , his expression was problematically serious .   
He glanced at Love Lost , emphasizing what he was talking about .   
I worried that she would see him and see something in that expression .   
Fortunately , she sat so we were two couches away , her left shoulder pointed at us , her face only visible from the side .   
She sat so her platform heel was propped up on the table ’s edge .
“
Sure .   
The monster , ” I said .
“ We have to account for where the monster was , and where it was poised to act .
”
“ While K gets an obnoxious number of points , ” Sveta said .   
“ Elbow him for me .
” I elbowed Rain .   
He looked at Sveta , who was smiling a bit , and forced a smile onto his own face , the projected image translating it .
“ Accounting for things like , say , the monster having its claw around the station ?
”
“
Yeah ?
”
Rain asked .
With my eyes , I indicated the pair of officers .
Beside me , Sveta reached for a chip .   
She took one in her fingers , and in the course of moving her hand toward her mouth , accidentally snapped it in two , the pieces landing in my lap .
I picked up the larger fragments of chip , popping one into my mouth .
“
Hey .
”
I held up the other half of the broken chip between two fingers , while Rain took over at the laptop , nudging my hand aside so he could do his thing .
“ Give , ” Sveta said .
I popped the half of chip into her mouth .
“
Thank you .
”
“ Station in its clutches .   
Right .   
That ’s … a danger .   
Lots of points to be lost , ” Rain said .
“ Already lost points , as I see it , ” I answered .   
“
Foregone conclusion , before we even started playing today .
”
Rain ’s knee bobbed up and down .   
“
I might need to take a walk soon , get some air .
”
Which translated to him potentially needing to make a run for it .   
Though if it came to that , I was n’t sure he really had any good options .   
Sveta and I were mobile .   
Tristan , Ashley , and Kenzie were closer to an escape route .   
Rain , though ?   
We ’d have to cover for Rain .
“
If you go , we ’ll watch your stuff , ” I murmured .   
I leaned back , shifting the chips over so they sat between Sveta and me .   
“
Make sure you ’re covered .
”
“ Thanks , ” Rain said .
So much of this was hidden behind veneers and translations .   
The signals we were using , the language , the false faces .
Nailbiter , roving and investigating as she roved , wandered off to one side , where she joined a group of the tent city thugs .   
I did n’t really have a better term for them
– the people who ’d been in the tent cities for long enough that they ’d seemed to adapt to the new environments .   
Almost like homeless people , almost like survivalists , but with a mean edge .
She seemed to know them , and after speaking with them for ten or twenty seconds , they got up and started fanning out , searching .
Love Lost looked very relaxed , her coat removed and folded over the back of the couch , while she talked with anti - parahuman people at the next couch over .   
It was clear they were n’t very keen on her , but they were n’t cussing at her or acting on their apparent dislike .   
What they were feeling seemed to stop at frowns and perpetual scowls .
Above , Kenzie , Ashley , and Tristan were talking , while leaning over the railing .   
They were doing their own surveillance .
“
Where did we leave off before the game ran out of battery ?
” I asked .   
“ Monster due to arrive ?
”
“
Arrived just as , ” Rain said .
“ Station in its clutches , and … house in clutches .
”
“ Yep , ” he said .   
“
You nailed it .
”
He ’d watched what Nailbiter was doing too .   
Good .
What else was there ?   
There were other icons for other fixtures of the area .   
A town hall , drawn like an old Washington capitol building , flag above it ?   
I had to assume it was co - opted , but it was n’t relevant here .   
A hospital ?   
No medical needs .
Business ?   
Not here .   
But I saw a couple of the library ’s staff at the fringes , standing by the public access computers , watching the lounge and the active meeting more than they were watching the library .   
A matter of fifteen or so feet from our couch , I could see one burly guy with a shaved head , folded arms , tattoos , and a librarian ’s apron on .   
I was n’t sure why the library staff had aprons , exactly , but it was so .   
The guy looked very menacing while wearing a denim - blue apron with a book embossed on the chest , a small notebook in the pocket .
Standing guard , like the police were doing .   
There had n’t been any apparent communication .
“ Business ?
” I asked .
“
Is there business in that quadrant ?
”
“ I dunno .   
Maybe a bookstore ?
” I asked .
“
Yeah .   
I get you now .   
I would n’t be surprised .   
Question is … what do you do if things have gone that far ?   
Panic ?
”
“
Stay out of our game monster ’s way , ” Sveta said .
“ AKA : panic , ” Rain said .
“ Staying out of the way is prudent , not panic , ” I said .   
“ Panic is dangerous in its own right , and it leads to mistakes .
”
“
Yeah , ” Rain said .
Nailbiter
’s squad of tent city thugs were still making their way across the floor .   
One walked down the aisle beside us , and I tried to act nonchalant .   
Rain and Sveta seemed to do okay too , because the guy passed by without incident .
Across the lounge , past a sea of couches shaped like quarter - arcs and quarter - circle tables , I saw Nailbiter continuing her own investigation .   
A teenager had her hand over her head , drawing out a line with an extended finger .
Talking about Sveta ’s whip .
They had to know we were here , now .
The discussion was ongoing , and we did n’t have ears on it .   
We had no surveillance tech that really sufficed , now , no camera overhead that could detect sound waves or however the ‘ sound camera’ worked .   
We had to operate by context , reading body language while trying not to look too obvious .
The problem was , Love Lost seemed utterly unbothered .   
Cool , calm , collected .   
Steely , even .   
I could look at the apparent leader or negotiator of the anti - parahuman group , a woman with very black eyebrows , blonde cornrows at either side of her head and a thicker braid along the top , and I could see her frustration , but without a good read on Love Lost , I was only seeing one side of the conversation .
Seeing Love Lost just as frustrated would suggest they were n’t finding a common ground .   
Seeing her possessed of her usual calm would have suggested she had the upper hand in whatever they were negotiating .
There was something in this situation that made me envision the situation at the time I ’d left Brockton Bay .   
A feral lunatic at the fringes , driving her dogs to attack civilians .   
Others seizing their own territories , capturing the locals , capturing the police , capturing businesses .
I ’d been fighting to correct that .   
I ’d had a lot of issues , then .   
The pain of losing Dean , of losing Uncle Neil and Eric .   
Dad being sick .   
I ’d been a little brute of a Brute - class cape , and I was n’t sure if any of those things had been on their way to getting better .   
But my city had been changing around me , and before I could do anything about it , the Slaughterhouse Nine had appeared .
This ?   
It reminded me of that scenario .   
The slow , subtle capture happening behind the scenes .   
Being on a villain ’s turf and getting a dawning sense of what that meant .
I got my phone out and typed a message to Shortcut and Spright , keeping an eye out to make sure nobody was looking over my shoulder .
Me : 

She ’s on scene here .   
Meeting with another group , all unpowered .   
Our cameras and some of our communications are out .   
She knows we ’re here .   
Has pawns in police , civvies , and library as guards or underlings .   
Two of her capes at her HQ , one in parking lot .   
Others in our area .   
Stand by .
I showed Sveta , then Rain .   
I got a nod of confirmation , then sent it .
Love Lost was reacting to something .   
She shook her head , then put her arms out , draping them along the back of the couch .   
With her coat off , she wore a long - sleeved sweater , and I could see the equipment along her arms , beneath the sleeves .   
It looked like the blonde braid - cornrow woman did too .   
Her head rested against the back of the couch for a moment , and she looked up .
Tristan , Kenzie , and Ashley were doing their best to look nonchalant .   
Love Lost did n’t seem to pick up on anything , turning her attention to Colt instead .
Colt sat on the corner of the couch , one foot on the ground .   
She was doing the talking , but with her position relative to ours , and the fact the couch was a quarter - circle in shape , her back was to us .   
I could only hope the others were following what she was doing .
Love Lost turned her head the other way , apparently distracted , and looked at Nailbiter .   
The outstretched hand to her right moved , fingers curling like she was making a claw - shape with each , simultaneously cracking her knuckles .
Or making a beckoning gesture .
“
She saw them , ” I said .
“
Did she ?
” Sveta asked .
I looked up at the group .   
Tristan looked down at me , and I opened my eyes wider .
A second later , Tristan , Ashley , and Kenzie were stepping away from the railing , heading down the corridor to the other half of the building .
“ We should go , ” Rain said .
“
Do n’t hurry or look rushed ,
” I said .
Rain nodded .
We packed up our stuff , getting our coats on-
only Sveta did n’t have to , because she had n’t taken her quilted - pattern long coat off before sitting down .
There were police , civilians , and business owners keeping an eye out for trouble .   
A good number of them were watching us , as Nailbiter reached
Love Lost ’s couch .
I was n’t sure if Love Lost said something or if some other signal was transmitted .   
If it was a statement , it was one or two words .   
Nailbiter stood straighter , made a gesture , and then stalked off in the direction of the ground - floor corridor to the other side of the Lyme Center .
Tristan ’s group on the second floor , passing through the center of the hourglass - shaped building .   
Nailbiter and her growing collection of people a floor below , a few steps behind .   
If the layout on the far side was like the layout on our side , then this group could and would easily intercept the others as they reached the bottom of any staircase .
I used my phone to send a warning to Tristan :
Me : 
 Inc.
I got my reply :
Tristan : 
 go
Go , not come ?
Okay .
Nobody was coming after us as we headed to the door .   
It seemed like a lot of the people who were undercover henchmen for Love Lost were responding to the threat , giving chase to the other half of our group .
“
Are we meeting up with the others ?
”
Sveta asked , managing to sound ninety - five percent casual .
“
They ’ll catch up , ” I said .   
“
They ’ll send a message if they need it .
”
I wished I could be more sure .   
I wished it was easier to wrap my head around just what we were dealing with here .   
I ’d compared it to the situation in Brockton Bay , but was this more of a Hellhound thing , where people were in danger , being controlled by fear ?   
A Regent thing , where the villain backed up local infrastructure because he benefited from it , but was otherwise as much a player in conflict and strife as any interloper ?
A ‘ Tattletale’ thing , where drugs and crime had been treated like hunters being handed out hunting licenses ?   
X allowed per week in her territory during the warlord phase ?   
X in Brockton Bay and New Brockton , after things had settled ?   
Technically not as bad as we ’d once had , but worse in so many other ways , because it represented giving up on better ?   
Halving the number of overdoses , but then giving up on reducing it further , because changing things meant having to work past her artificial rule of law , or waiting for a villain with too much on her plate to find the time to talk about it and implement the changes ?
Hearing anecdotes and seeing evidence that the crime rate was slowly getting worse , that drugs were more and more of a thing , and wondering if she was losing her handle on it all or if it was intentional on her part .   
Wondering and not being able to ever know for certain .
Things could n’t work that way .
Love
Lost …
I had no idea where she fit on the spectrum , but I detested so much of what Tattletale represented , and I had a hard time believing Love Lost would be any better .   
Ex - law enforcement or no .
The air was cold as we exited Lyme Center and emerged into the parking lot .   
Nobody followed , nobody seemed to pay us much mind .   
It was Tristan , Kenzie , and Ashley who were evading Nailbiter right now .
“
We ’ll distract , ” I said .   
“
See if we ca n’t pull some attention away from the others , or make them lose out if they do n’t .
”
“
What ’s the strategy ?
” Rain asked .
“
I ’m thinking … the moment there was trouble , they probably made a call to Disjoint and Sidepiece .   
Probably a few others .
”
“
Not Kitchen Sink or Hookline , ” Rain said .   
“
They ’re on
Love Lost ’s shitlist right now , going after a kid .
”
“
I ’m going to put Spright and Shortcut on Sidepiece .   
Us ?   
Let ’s look for that truck they were driving , with the tinker gun on it .
”
“ I like that .   
Fan out and find it ?   
Covered truck ?
” Sveta asked .
“
Yeah , ” I said , drawing my phone out of my pocket .   
Beside me , Sveta motioned , and Rain nodded .
Signals exchanged , Sveta headed left .   
Rain headed right .
The parking lot was dirt , the individual spaces marked out with lines of yellow - painted stones , some of which had been kicked around or moved by the passage of tires .   
With the ice and the snow , the dirt was hard , and as packed as it had been , it had still been disturbed , then left to freeze disturbed .   
Every step was a hazard for the ankles .   
It slowed Sveta down in a visible way .   
Rain had a slight benefit from his power to steady himself .
I had my flying , but I could n’t be too obvious .   
I waited for a car to pull out of a space , before I resumed walking , my flight only partially on , keeping my step lighter .
Me : 

Villain reinforce probably approaching Lyme Center from 1:00/NNE 
 Disjoint guy , white , skinny disconnects and teleports body parts 
 Sidepiece , girl , white , curvy , hurls explosive chunks of her flesh .   
V. dangerous . 

May be driving patchwork hatchback or walking .
No messages from Tristan ’s group yet .
I got my reply from our reinforcements :
AG : 

We know who they are what they do
That would be Shortcut , presumably .
I focused on looking for the tinker .   
He ’d blasted our camera .   
A gun that big could n’t be easy to put together .   
It was a weakness of tinkers , that they could lose their stuff and they ’d be that much weaker .   
Things got broken .   
There was wear and tear .   
There was a need for upkeep .
Kenzie ’s current status emphasized that much .   
So capable , but so capable of being knocked down a few pegs , with an arduous recovery if she was .
I heard a whistle .
Yeah .   
A large truck , with a covered back ?   
Easy to spot .   
It had n’t taken long .
Sveta and I found Rain .   
And we rounded a group of cars that had been parked haphazardly , where yellow stones had been partially buried by early snowfall .   
The truck had been parked at the back of the lot .   
The tinker was inside the cab , letting the engine run , presumably to stay warm .
“
I ’m thinking …
let ’s not give him a chance to reach for any weapons , ” I murmured .   
“
You deal with Tinkers by denying them access to their stuff .
”
“
I could pull him out through the window , ” Sveta said .   
“ I do n’t want to cut him up though .   
Sorry .
”
“ Car windows do n’t break like that , ” Rain said .   
“
But they do n’t break that easily if you punch them or hit them with a baseball bat , either .   
Let me set up , you follow up .   
One two punch .
”
“ One two three , ” I said .   
“
Let me get in position , then we go .
”
That got me a pair of nods .
I hurried forward , ducking down beside a car .   
I looked back in the direction of the Lyme Center , worrying a bit about the others .
We ’d trust them for now .
I gave the other two a nod .
Rain created a silver crescent , holding it in his hands .   
He was far enough back that I could n’t hear him , but I saw him mouthing the words .
He flung the blade .   
It slammed into the door of the truck , drawing out a glowing silver line .
In the dark , Sveta ’s hands were hard to see .   
One seized the car door , tugging .   
The other followed a second later , reaching through the gap in the same second it appeared .
The guy had his seatbelt on , and that delayed things for a second .   
I saw him scrabble , reaching for something .   
Then Sveta had him , tugging him away and beneath the seatbelt- his feet got caught and he slipped back , head moving in the direction of the ground , while his feet were on and near the seat .
She got another hand on him , and when she tugged on him this time , he moved at a velocity that kept his head from scraping against frozen dirt .
I was there to catch him .   
My aura blasted him while he was in transit .   
I was ready to slap or catch a weapon out of his hands , but he was unarmed .
Sveta pulled him close , her feet skidded on hard , icy ground , and she nearly toppled , taking the guy to the ground with her .   
Rain caught her , his body behind hers , then produced a silver blade , holding it to the guy ’s throat .
The flannel shirt tinker wore a mask , soft fabric , bright blue lenses , a spike extending over his head .   
The fabric stopped where his facial hair began , but the look just really did n’t work .   
It rarely did , unless the beard was magnificent .
I could see him huffing for breath .   
The emotion blast had been to put him more off balance , and to mess up his coordination in case he had a weapon as Sveta pulled him close .
I left them to it and headed to the truck .
“ Be careful of traps , ” Rain called out to me .
“ Will do , ” I said .   
“
Thanks .   
Costumes on .
” I double - tapped the sun badge I wore .   
The projection around me fell away .   
I pulled my two segments of breastplate from my bag , where they protected my laptop , and set them in place .
Behind me , Sveta had dropped the human shape , and wore a mask .   
Rain had donned his circuitboard mask .
I hoped the other group was doing okay .
The truck still hummed with activity , the heaters blasting out warm air that steamed up the windows .
There were a bag fast food , a cell phone , and a sketchbook on the divider between the seats , and what looked like a laser rifle was resting with its butt - end on the floor in front of the passenger seat , the length resting against the seat itself .   
The weapon he ’d been reaching for .
No apparent traps , no wires , no ominous noises .   
I reached for the cell phone and picked it up .   
No trap , no shock .
The phone was at the lock screen .   
The sketchpad-
I flipped through .   
Tinker notes .
I could confiscate that .   
Set him back a bit .   
If he wanted to work with villains , especially villains who ’d been noted for hurting people ?   
Killing ?   
He could lose some ground , suffer a bit for it .
I walked around the truck , heading for the covered back .   
Let ’s see this gun .
I did n’t get that far .   
I heard a strained grunt , and I turned around .
Rain had collapsed , and Sveta had caught him .
The tinker ’s
right arm had a band around it , encircling the bicep .   
Everything past the band was electricity , in the rough shape of a human limb .
I flew to them .
He reached out with the electric arm , touching Sveta .   
I saw Rain jerk , while Sveta seemed to endure it .
“ Does n’t work !
”
she grunted out the words through clenched teeth .   
She let Rain slump to the ground and reached out , catching the guy by the one still - human wrist .
A metal band flared at his left arm , the electricity melting the fabric of his coat around the ring , and taking the sleeve with it , as arm became more electricity .   
Her hand slipped away .
Immediately , she was reaching again .   
This time seizing him by the neck .
He had a collar on .   
As the collar flared , his head dissolved into a localized storm of electricity , the ‘ forks’ of electricity serving as hair , something flatter and more interconnected for the mask .   
Where the lenses had been a bold electric blue before , they were now two dark ovals against the backdrop of frothing energy .
Where energy arced from one of the rings to the other , it traced lines across his body and turned flesh to this alternate state .
Using tech to go breaker .
A shame that his head was breaker - state , because this time , me using my aura did n’t even make him flinch .
I brought out the Wretch , as he ducked around me .   
His arms were longer like this , and as he swung one in my general direction , he came into contact with the Wretch .
I saw sparks and arcs highlight the Wretch ’s general shape , just for an instant .   
I saw him see it .
He reached out , checking the coast was clear , and again , came into contact with an outstretched arm of the Wretch .   
Again , highlighting its shape , and that it had moved .
His belt flashed , electricity crackling in a ring around his midsection .   
Then his legs were gone-
he was a torso with a head of electricity , two lash - like limbs , and a tail of lightning , floating in the air .   
The electricity that crackled along his chest and stomach left flesh temporarily phased out in its wake .   
I could see veins against a backdrop of bright lights tracing similar forking lines .   
I could see raw , red flesh where the ethereal lightning form cut through physical meat .
He changed direction instead of trying to go through me and toward the Lyme Center .   
His movements were more unpredictable now , faster .   
He did n’t fly or teleport , but arced , bouncing off of a car , then lunging toward his own vehicle .   
I flew after , Wretch up .
Heading for his big gun ?
For the gun in the passenger seat ?
He chose the latter , lunging toward the open truck door .   
His movements stuttered , as he darted fifteen to fifty feet ahead , stopped , reoriented himself , then lunged forward again .
It took three such movements to get himself to the truck .   
Faster as an energy breaker than I was as a flier .
With lightning hands , he held his laser rifle .   
He twisted around , weapon in his arms-
A silver blade flew past him .   
Rain ’s crescent of light did n’t touch the arm of energy .   
It did cross the body of the weapon .
The guy aimed at me , then fired .
Sparks showered , geysering out through the line of silver .   
Lightning jumped out , wild and white , tracing along the ground with no apparent rhyme or reason .
Rain was still on the ground , but he was already creating his next silver blade , ready to throw it if needed .   
The tinker threw his broken rifle aside , then headed directly for the Center .   
I flew to intercept , and he threw himself at the ground , bouncing off of a frozen puddle and toward the same block of cars we ’d used for cover .
I positioned myself to keep him from going over , ready to move to either side if he tried to go around .
He went through .   
I could see the arcs of energy crackling around the bones of the car he slammed into , as he conducted himself through it .   
He leaped out and into the next car , chaining his way through .
“ Sveta !
”
I called out .
He emerged from the far end of the block , stopping to orient himself again , looking around .   
He turned to stare at me with those black ovals , then darted for the cars nearest the front door of the Center , Sveta hot on his heels .
She was faster for short distances and when traveling where there were handholds .   
In this environment , though , I could see how she was regularly going for a grip on something and slipping off , or taking a second longer to slide to a stop and be able to reach out again .
Even with that , she was faster than me .   
She collided with him , and even though he was ninety percent energy , he reacted , conducting along her metal body , and he sprawled with her .
He was faster to recover .   
No arms and legs to manage .
“
Anything that conducts !
” I shouted .
Which would hamper and slow him down , but did n’t stop him from making progress .
“ Tress !
”
Rain hollered her name .   
“
Here ! ”
Having to stop and reach for whatever he was offering or throwing her way slowed her down .   
I passed her , chasing the guy down .
With Sveta ’s extended arms and what looked like folded metal blades in each hand , Sveta made the tinker ’s form distend , stretching out as it automatically clung to the metal , then snapped back in a way that seemed difficult for him .
He twisted around , using his lighting hands to seize the blades .   
The pair engaged in a brief tug - of - war , which I interrupted by diving at him , Wretch active .   
He flashed in the instant before I made contact .
The Wretch ’s hands and feet stabbed into the earth , cracking the frozen ground .
He ’d darted away , letting go of the blades .   
Sveta swung again , and he dodged , moving further away .
Further away , but still making incremental progress toward the front doors .   
The truck had been parked in the far corner of the parking lot , as large as the parking lot of any mall I ’d been to , and he was four - fifths of the way to his destination .   
There was a real risk that Love Lost would see the flashes or hear the noise and respond .
The primary danger , though , was that if he feinted one way and moved another , it might mean he could reach the doors and pass through , surrounding himself with a few hundred hostages , and a dozen more escape routes .
He was functionally a breaker , and I had a limited sense of what worked and did n’t work for breakers .     
I ’d met and talked with Velocity , and I ’d met and talked with Shadow Stalker .   
I ’d read up on others .
He was also a tinker , and I had some idea of the tools that served against tinkers .   
Not that I ’d fought many before Gold Morning .   
Leet and Bakuda , really , and Bakuda only in that
I ’d been trying to evacuate people from a series of tinker bombs going off .   
She had been nowhere nearby .
Still , the others needed the distraction .
Sveta caught him , swinging the blades through his electric body .   
It bought me a few seconds to look , as I flew down , putting myself between the tinker and the cars .
Cars-
I could n’t use them as weapons .   
Because destroying people ’s property in a lower - stakes encounter like this would do more harm than good , because I would n’t hit him anyway .   
He was too fast , too on guard for it .
The road was dirt , but dirt was n’t useful .
The building itself ?   
No .   
If things got that far , he was out of reach .
I could see the artificial speed bump in the road .   
A hump of dirt , painted yellow .
My eye fixed on that .   
Yellow paint where the dirt sloped up against sidewalk , to mark the rise , to let people know to watch their step ,
and-
I retreated , flying over the cars .   
The tinker broke away from Sveta , saw me heading one way , and started to take the long way around , the front door in his sights .
I dove for the ground , and I had the Wretch dig its hands into the earth .   
I could n’t rely on it to do as I wanted , but I could do something else .   
Faced with a second me that reached out and lashed out mindlessly , I could deny it , I could allow it to work …
Or I could at least make it lash out in a predictable way .   
I could lean on the fact that the Wretch outlasted a sustained hurt better than it outlasted a sudden , sharp kind of hurt .
I spun .   
Each outstretched arm swiped at the earth .   
A sustained battering , spread out across the Wretch ’s limbs .
I carved my way a few feet into the ground near the speed bump , drove my hand into the fissure that cracked the hard earth there , and found my prize .
The tinker had escaped Sveta , and he had escaped Rain .   
He found his orientation , and he lunged .
I lunged too .   
Wretch active , I tore the flexible pipe out of the ground , flying along it , so the Wretch skimmed along its length , raising it up .    
The hump was n’t just a speed bump , but earth covering the pipe that had been set in a shallow trench and then covered .   
Water or power to the Lyme Center .
A tripwire for my quarry .
The tinker grazed the pipe , and the tinker conducted across it , stretching out ten or fifteen feet to the left , and an equal distance to the right .   
I knew Shadow Stalker had trouble with electricity running through walls , with rain and even things as simple as smoke thick in the air .   
I knew Velocity had his own issues , a reduced ability to affect the world , to the point that mundane obstacles and barriers like closed doors could hamper him .   
Other breakers had their difficulties .   
The uncommon hazards .
I dropped the Wretch , which let me easily drop the pipe .   
While he was disoriented , I was free to fly in .   
I smacked into his midpoint , and the Wretch helped to scatter him again .
Inside the building , the power flickered and died .   
All was black for a long moment , the only real light was cast by the tinker .
I reached out and the Wretch found a grip at one of the arm - rings .   
I let the Wretch break it , and the tinker ’s arm snapped back into reality , with ripple effects of real - self tinker appearing across his body .
He dropped to his knees , in apparent surrender .   
I remained stock still .
“ We should go !
”
Sveta called out .   
“ Rain ’s already going !
”
To my left , the lights were coming back on .   
A backup generator had come on , or the break in power had been a temporary disruption in the line more than an outright shutdown .   
I could see Love Lost on her feet .   
The claws had dropped out of one of her sleeves , a wire and rod framework that tipped each finger with a two - inch claw .   
Her other hand was pressing the mouthgear down over the lower half of her face .
We should go .
It was good that Rain was getting out of here .   
It was harder for him to move .
We backtracked , moving faster than Love Lost could easily chase .   
Back to the truck , where the engine was still running .   
Rain was approaching it .
Byron , Swansong and Lookout were there .   
Lookout was in costume , and wore a jacket and pads along her legs , along with her bodysuit .   
Swansong looked like she should be cold , but was n’t .
“
Love Lost is coming , ” I said .
“ We outnumber her , ” Ashley said .
“ Not if she has half this settlement working for her , ” I said .   
“
Let ’s disable the gun and regroup .
”
“ I can blast it , ” Rain said .   
“
Except it could blow up , apparently .
”
“
Let me , ” Lookout said .   
“
A gun like this has to have targeting , and I can work with targeting .
”
“ I have tinker notes , ” I said .
“ Give it to Rain .   
Let him look .   
I ’ll fiddle .
”
“ You have forty - five seconds , ” I said .
“
Got it !
”
Swansong lifted her up onto the truck bed .
I turned to Byron .   
“
You guys good ?
”
“
We ducked into a store .   
My brother swapped out for me , Swansong and Lookout switched looks , since they ’re wearing the disguise pendants .   
Nailbiter passed right by us .   
Trick was getting out without looking suspicious .
”
“
Good , ” I said .
“
Tristan ’s idea , ” he said .   
“ Electricity tinker ?
”
“
Something like that .
”
“ Lookout ! ”
Rain said .   
“
Found the pages .   
Here ’s targeting .
”
She reached down as he reached up , passing her the book .
A glowing screen illuminated the pane of her helmet as she leaned over it .
“
We ’re good !
” she declared .   
“
But this is n’t our last stop .
”
“ We ca n’t dawdle , ” Swansong said .
“ Remember what I said about guns ?
”
Lookout asked .
“ Guns ?
” I asked .
“
Come on !
”
We hurried in the direction she ’d pointed .
“ I think I got a read on what they were saying , ” Lookout said .   
“ On the surface , this was a weapons deal .   
They ’re providing Love Lost ’s group with guns and other weapons .   
She ’s supposed to help them when they demand it .   
Any target they name .   
If Love Lost wins , then it ’s good .   
If she loses , then it ’s another cape out of the picture .   
Right ?
”
“ Makes some sense , ” I said .   
“
I ’d have a hard time believing that ’s the full picture .
”
“ They were getting pissy because she was saying some targets were off limits .   
Well , she was n’t saying much of anything .
”
“ Colt was , ” Ashley said .
“
Yeah , ” Lookout said .   
She huffed for breath .   
She was n’t out of shape , but she was n’t a runner either , and we were far enough out at the edges of the parking lot that the lot had n’t been fully cleared of snow or debris .   
Just a little more effort for those putting boot to muck , especially when she had shorter legs .
Sveta , at least , seemed to be doing okay .   
She was still holding the two folded bits of metal .
I checked to see if the coast was clear , and I saw Love Lost .   
She stood on the hood of a car , back straight , hair and coat moving in the wind .   
Not chasing , not using her power .   
Just staring .
No Nailbiter at her side .   
Her tinker was a little worse for wear , and her reinforcements had n’t yet arrived .
“
Here !   
These sedans , ” Lookout said .
A person stepped out from between the cars , hand at his waist , reaching for a gun .
He saw the size of our group , and he raised both his hands instead of drawing his weapon .
“
You ’re with them ?
” I asked .
“
Fuck you , ” he said .
He ’s with them .
Byron took the guy by the shoulder , leading him to the side , where he was made to kneel on the frozen ground , hands at his side .   
Byron divested the guy of his weapons .   
A knife and a gun .
“
How did you know it was these ?
”
I asked Lookout .
“
Because I was keeping an eye out for trouble using the Center ’s surveillance before it all went hinky .   
We saw the anti parahuman dorks show up , except we did n’t know it was them then .   
These are their cars .
”
“ Tail ends are low to the ground , ” Rain said .   
“ Heavy weight in the rears .   
Did they bring the weapons with ?
”
“
Fuck you , ” the guy said .
“ If you ’re going to be mad , be mad at yourselves , ” Swansong said .   
“ Your laziness .
”
“
That ’s a good eye , Precipice , ” Byron said .   
“
Can we check ?   
Tear it open , Vic ?
”
“
No , do n’t break it .   
You could damage the contents , ” Swansong said .   
“ Sveta .   
Pick it .
”
“ I do n’t know how to pick locks .
”
“
Do you know what raking is ?   
You should be capable .
” Sveta frowned .
“
Come .   
I ’ll show you .
”
In the distance , Love Lost only watched .   
I saw her clench her claw .   
Nailbiter had appeared , standing behind her , and I saw the electric flicker around the tinker , who was wholly human again .   
It was broken gear that was crackling .
They did n’t attack or approach .
“
This is the cheap and dirty way of opening a lock , ” Swansong said .   
“
You want to jostle the pins .   
Go back and forth , as soon as you feel them , pop them up .   
Keep pressure so the lock is turning-
” “ Already doing that , ” Sveta said .   
her hand was removed , and tendrils were groping at and around the lock .   
“ I have to use my smallest tendrils , which are also the shortest , which is awkward- ”
The trunk popped open .   
I saw the surprise on Sveta ’s face .
Inside , packed in cases with foam inserts separating them , rows of weapons .   
Not Gimel or Bet weapons , at a glance , or at least , not from any country I was aware of .   
The script was blocky , and it looked like it had been stamped on .
“
Taking photos , ” Lookout said , tapping the side of her helmet .
“
How did you know how to lockpick ?
”
Byron asked , quiet .   
“ You could n’t when you were a villain .
”
“ I study , ” Swansong said .   
“
It ’s the kind of thing I watch before bed .
”
“
It ’s cool , ” Sveta said , and her smile seemed genuine .   
“
It ’s neat to know
I can do that .   
Thank you .
”
“
Mm hmm .
”
The enmity , the frustration- it did n’t seem as bad now .   
It helped to have other focuses .   
Three nondescript cars with trunks packed with munitions , instead of jealous relationships .
I picked out some samples- things we could show others , as well as a slip of paper and a lid .   
I held all three .
I met Swansong
’s eyes .   
I jerked my head a hair toward the trunk .
Everyone stepped back as she reached forward .   
Her power licked out , and it bucked and kicked , flaring to its full range as it twisted , tore , and annihilated everything in the car from back windshield to bumper , including some of the rear tires .
She did the same for the other two cars .   
We opened each , and then we destroyed the contents .
When I looked back , Love Lost and her retinue were gone .
“
She ’s gone , ” Byron observed .
“
No , ” Rain said .   
“
It ’s not over .   
She would n’t leave things the way they are now .   
Her losing , especially to me .
”
“
There ’s something more going on , ” I said .   
“
Something she ’s doing , people she ’s working with . ”








Sveta was out of her armor , and her tendrils flicked out with enough force to crack ice and send the hard crust of snow flying overhead .   
As she approached , one of her tendrils whipped out and caught me , seizing my forcefield .
It let go a moment later .   
Forceful as the grab had been , it had n’t disrupted the field .
“
Sorry !
”
“
My fault for getting too close !   
Keep it up !
”
I called out .
In the gloom , even with the snow reflecting ambient light up , and with Sveta ’s face being pale , it was still hard to make her out .   
She was more easily detected by the loose ring of whipped - up snow and flecks of ice than by anything else .   
I could judge the maximum range of her tendrils and look at the ring to estimate the center of it .   
The origin point .
I floated , keeping one careful eye on the ring while my eyes scanned the snow .   
It was n’t easy to find what I was looking for .   
Holes that animals had dug , depressions , and shadows cast by distant objects all looked the same .
As a group , we ’d fanned out , moving over the field , the road a hundred feet to my left , the streetlights casting a yellow pallor over the field .
“ We might have to call it quits !
” Tristan shouted .
“ If you ’re going to wimp out , switch to Byron !   
The cold does n’t bother him !
”   
Rain .
“
I ’m
switching to him , but it ’s not because I ’m wimping out !   
He might have seen something , and he deserves a turn !
”
“
Yeah !   
Sure ! ”
“
Also , just saying , he ’s got the crampons on his boots , and I ’ve got the boots for running indoors !   
He ’s better equipped for the snow !
”
“
Sure ! ”
“
Stop saying that !
”   
Tristan called out .
“ We need to meet Spright too !
”
I called out .   
“
It ’s about time .   
Five more minutes !
”
“
It ’s no big !
”   
Kenzie .   
“
I do n’t want anyone getting cold !   
We could go now , really !
”
“
We ’re going to find it .
”   
Ashley , in a firm statement that I could only barely hear .
Sveta continued her patrol , edging closer to me .   
I ceded the ground to her , flying up and back .   
I could see a crop - circle style swathe that had been cut through the field in her wake .
I was rooting for her , really .   
With her going to this much effort , the recent spell of frustration , and her needing to feel included , I wanted her to score a win doing what she was good at .
I looked skyward for a moment .   
Snow was falling , which was n’t helping our efforts .   
High above , the barely visible clouds were clashing with one another .   
We were n’t even that close to any portals .   
I was glad to have the Wretch encapsulating me , keeping the worst of the wind off .   
It made the cold something more insidious and subtle , than a blast that left me drained .
My phone buzzed in my pocket .   
With gloves on , I fished it free .   
Spright with a meeting place .
I did n’t respond right away , holding the phone in both hands instead .   
My eyes scanned the terrain .   
If I were all business , I ’d have said time was up , that we should give up and meet our allies .
I glanced over at the section of field where Sveta was tearing things up .   
Reaching , groping , finding a small tree to grab , or just standing herself up on some tendrils while reaching out with others .   
A herky - jerky progress across snow with grass and rocks jutting out from it .
I crossed two numb fingers , looked down to look at the snow below me and tried to tell holes from rocks and shadows .
We were making the Advance Guard guys wait , but some things were more important .
“
Found it !
”
Rain called out .
The tendrils stopped the thousand - flag - grab attempt .   
There was only stillness , the dark tendrils invisible against a dark backdrop , the shape that was Sveta ’s head too camouflaged and small to see .
Well .   
Rain needed some wins too .
I floated over to Sveta as she returned to her body , which was sitting on a rock , the front and back halves of her torso hanging apart , a gap marking the divide .   
I waited , quiet so that she would n’t be spooked and lash out , her coat folded over my arm .
Her arms and legs shifted slightly as she found grips on wires and the loop - pulls .   
The handles , for lack of a better word .   
She was still working her way back in when she looked up at me .   
“
Sorry I yanked you .   
Did I hurt you ?
”
“
No .   
Forcefield , not me .
”
“
Good , ” she said .   
She pulled the two halves of her torso together , craning her head around to keep tendrils from getting pinched .   
Clasped could be heard from the inside , and then her prosthetic hands reached up to do up more mundane clasps on either side of the neck .   
“
I was pretty sure .   
My head plays tricks on me sometimes , and I am just a bit numb .
”
She eased her way to her feet , moving slowly , periodically thumping around in her body as she lashed out within the confines of the suit .   
and rearranged herself .
“
It ’s been a long day and a long night , ” I said .
“
Is it that obvious that I ’m tired ?
” she asked .   
She stood straight , and she lifted her chin to encircle her neck with a band of metal that had been hanging loose around the collar .   
Metal clicked as it cinched tight .   
She did the same with another band , closer to her neck .   
Binding all of the tendrils into a ‘ neck’ that was one solid cord .
I steadied her with one hand and held her coat so she could slide her arms into the sleeves .   
“
You would n’t be the only one that ’s tired and cold .   
But I think we ’re doing okay tonight .
”
“
Do n’t jinx it .   
Weld and Crystal are supposed to get back late tonight , and if you keep talking like that then something ’s going to get in the way of our reunion .
”
“
Mm , yeah .   
Not sure what Crystal is going to say .   
Knowing her , she ’ll just go straight to sleep .
”
“
I ’m looking forward to sleep , ” Sveta said .   
“
Half of me wants to see Weld and talk for a straight week , and the other half wants to say nothing at all , to avoid overwhelming him .   
Go back to the apartment , and curl up in bed .   
Make myself a pillow nest on his chest and have him do this thing he does where he puts his hand at the back of my head , tendrils and stuff through his fingers , and puts that gentle pressure down on me .   
Pushing me into the pillows and his chest with the weight of his hand .
”
“ You put way more effort into describing one of those things .   
It sounds like you have a preference .
” Sveta smiled .   
“
I ’ve been thinking about it lately .   
But does n’t it sound bad if I do n’t want to talk to my boyfriend after not seeing him for a while ?
”
“ You want to be close to him .   
That ’s , ah , I envy you having that to look forward to .
”
“
It ’s weird to picture someone envying me .
”
“ Nah , ” I said .   
I bumped her shoulder with mine as we trudged over in the direction of the main group .   
“
Weld ’s one of the truly good good guys .   
And so are you , for the record .
”
She shook her head .
“
So are you , ”
I said , for emphasis .   
“
And you two deserve each other in the best way .   
If you ’re stuck on what to do , you could let him take the lead on how to reunite , ” I said .   
“ If it was hard or ugly where he was , he might want to just cuddle instead of getting super into it .
” Sveta gave me a one - armed hug .
“
I wanted to ask , ” she said .
“
What ? ”
“ Ashley .   
She showed me the lockpicking thing .   
Was that because you said something to her ?
”
“
No , ” I said .
“
Was it because … I hate to ask , even .   
I should n’t ask .   
Benefit of a doubt , right ?

Did Kenzie listen in and share with Ashley ?
”
Sveta made a face .
“ I think that was just Ashley .
” Sveta nodded .
The others were huddled .   
Rain blew on his hands for warmth , then clasped them together , before folding them inside another pair of hands that stuck out of his sleeves .   
Ashley did n’t look dressed sensibly for the weather , but as far as I could tell her hands did n’t get cold , and she was putting on a brave face , her back straight , hands in her pockets .   
Her nose and ears looked visibly red in the gloom , though , and I strongly suspected she would be annoyed at the fact .
Byron was fine , of course , entirely in his element , and Kenzie had the stuff with her to dress for the weather .   
She had the camera that Rain had found clasped in her gloved hands .   
It looked like Byron was trying to free a bit of fabric from a sharp bit of metal without damaging the glove too much .
“
How ’s the camera ?
” I asked .
“ Broken in six different and major ways .   
But it ’s nice to have the parts .   
Makes fixing it way faster .
”
“
That ’s good , ” Sveta said .
Kenzie nodded .
“ Spright wants to meet , ” I said , showing them my phone-
more to just indicate the glowing screen than to hold it out for them to see the text messages .   
“ If anyone wants to opt out , go home , warm up , recharge for tomorrow , build stuff
, I do n’t think anyone ’s going to hold it against them .   
Having some people who are a little more refreshed at the start of tomorrow could be good .
”
The statement earned me some blank stares .
“ I heard the emphasis on building stuff , ” Kenzie said .   
“
You do n’t have to shoo me away or anything .
”
“
I ’m not .   
I ’m just offering an out , ” I said .   
“
For a lot of us , this conversation could be personal or difficult .
”
Rain made a sound , creaky and low in his throat , as if he was chewing on the idea .   
“
It ’s because it ’s personal and difficult that some of us have to show .
”
“
Then let ’s go talk to Sidepiece and Disjoint , ” I said .
⊙ “ Fuck you , ” Sidepiece said , turning to Swansong .   
“
The short hair looks good , hon , but you looked way better in black and fuck you .
”
“
The white is growing on me , ” Ashley said .
“ Is the ‘ fuck you’ growing on you too ?   
Go fuck yourself with the business end of a broken bottle ,
yeah ?
”
Sidepiece retorted .   
She turned to Rain , “
And while I ’m at it , fuck you , kid killer .   
You think she did n’t mention that detail ?   
I hope you shared with your team .
”
“ I did , actually , ” Rain said .
“
Did you share all the gory details , kid killer ?   
Did you tell them about her having to watch her daughter ’s face get cracked open on a table every time it ’s her night ?
”
“
Yeah .   
I explained some of that pretty early on .
”
“
Then fuck you , that ’s secret identity shit , you asshole .   
You act like you ’re all for the rules and then you share that stuff ?   
Fuck you .
”
“
I left out the details pertinent to-
”
“
Then fuck you for leaving out details and not owning up to every last bit of it !
” Sidepiece said .
“ Fuck me either way , huh ?
”
Rain asked , his voice quiet .
“
No , ” Sidepiece said .   
“
No , no , no .   
Fuck
you one particular way , okay ?   
Take the narrow end of the broken bottle I told her to fuck herself with , stick your narrower pecker into it , and break the neck off while you ’re inside it .   
Then fuck it .
”
“
There ’s a kid here , ” Sveta said .
“ Fuck her !   
Fuck that surveillance state fucking tinker bullshit unblinking creepiness !
”
“ I think she ’s pissed , ” Capricorn said .
“
Fuck you !   
Fuck off !
”
“ I do n’t think this is going anywhere , ” Shortcut said .   
“
We ’re not going to get anything useful here .
”
“ Waiting on a text , ” I murmured .
“ You really like making us wait , ” he said .   
“
You let your guys go and now you want to benefit off of our catches ?   
Do you think we ’re going to go home and let you take the credit ?
”
“ They totally do , ” Disjoint said .
“ Shut up !
”
Shortcut barked .
“
That ’s not what we ’re doing , ” Capricorn said .   
Byron .
“
I guess I ’m supposed to take your word for it ?
”
Shortcut said .
“ Shortcut , ” Spright said .   
“
People do n’t like capes right now .   
Who are we supposed to be getting credit from ?
”
“ Everyone , ” Shortcut said .
I kept my mouth shut for the moment .   
On my phone ’s screen , Nat had left me with only an ‘ asking around’ .
Our group was assembled in a garage , for lack of a better word .   
It was more like a shack , with sliding barn doors and a way through wide enough for a car to drive in and park , with the doors closing in front and behind .   
The gas , tools , and other things had been carted away by whoever operated the place during the daylight hours .   
The space was oil - stained concrete floor and thin wooden walls , the only decoration a table that was a wooden door and four planks for legs , and a pile of engine parts in the corner that clearly violated the rules that had been put up on the wall .
Sidepiece and Disjoint were by the wooden table .   
Disjoint had a loop of something connecting him to the flimsy plank leg of the table .   
Sidepiece had her hands cuffed behind her head .   
She wore her partial , phantom - of - the - opera face mask , white with a ragged edge that had been beaded with what looked like red nail polish , to look like blood , black hair covering the part of her face that her mask did n’t .   
She was curvy , except everything between the ribcage and the pelvis had been picked clean- her stuffed polyester coat covered most of that up , but blood stained the belt - line of her jeans .
Disjoint , meanwhile , was black , with a ‘ blindfold’ band of white across his eyes , a mask at the bottom half of his face , meeting with the line of white facepaint .   
More bands encircled his arms , not touching the spaces which were decorated with tattoos .   
He wore a costume top ,    and regular black jeans .   
His coat had been removed by Spright and Shortcut before we ’d come , and it had the same lines painted on the sleeves .
“
I ’m saying everyone counts when it comes to getting credit .   
Because rep matters , ” Shortcut added .   
“
Stupid fucking kids join them because they have the rep
and we do n’t .   
Because they seem ‘ cool’ .
”
“ Damn fucking straight , ” Sidepiece commented .   
“
I ’d tell you to fuck yourself too , but you already did , wearing that fucking awful , uncooool costume .
”
She drew out the word , with vocal fry amped up and it sounded like she was belching it .
Leaning against the wall , her arms folded , Swansong looked away to hide her smile .   
Despite herself , Sidepiece smirked .   
She corrected the smirk and spat onto the floor .
“
This costume is focus group tested , moron , ” Shortcut said .   
He reached up and flicked one of the circular discs that seemed to intersect his costume , like Halloween knife - headband combination that kids could pay a dollar for , to make it look like the knife was stuck through their heads .
“
So were the Jeep Rockaybe , the Roundphone , and the second Iron Giant movie , so good for you
, you ’re in shit company , ” Sidepiece retorted .
“
You ’re not going to win this one , ” Swansong said .   
“ Not if you get into a knock - down , drag - out back and forth .   
You ’ll lose .
”
“ I agree , ” Spright said .
“ Fuck that , ” Shortcut answered .
“ I will kick over this chessboard , shit on it , and I will strut like the pigeon I am !
” Sidepiece said .
Ashley pointed at Sidepiece with both index fingers , as if to say ‘ that right there’ .
“ And fuck you all ! ”
Sidepiece added .
“ You ’re giving me a headache , ” Disjoint said .   
The table wobbled as he brought his head back to rest against the leg .   
“
Can you turn down the volume two clicks , ‘ piece ?
”
“
Aw , I ’m
sorry baby , ” Sidepiece said .   
She stuck her foot out in the direction of his foot .
Shortcut ’s weapon came down , embedding itself in the concrete between the two feet .
“
What the fuck ?
”
Sidepiece reacted , going straight back to a maxed out volume knob with the ‘ what’ and bringing it to a near - whisper by the end of the ‘ fuck’ .   
“
You almost took my toes off .
”
“
No touching .
”
Still no response on my phone .   
I knew it was a lot to ask , shooting questions Natalie ’s way , but in our recent contact , she ’d asked that we continue to loop her in .   
I ’d brought up where we were , and now she was phoning around .
Well , could n’t hurt to try asking .   
Maybe one of the two would answer .
“
Why did Love Lost want the guns ?
” I asked .
“
To shoot shit ?
”
“
I said this was a waste of time ten minutes ago , ” Shortcut said .   
“
I think I ’m right .
”
“
You are so right , ” Disjoint said .
I bit my tongue .
“
She ’s dealing with an anti - parahuman group , ” I said .   
“
How does that make sense ?
”
“ Pretty sketchy , ” Sidepiece said .   
“
I was n’t about that .   
Stayed home , diddled my boyfriend .
”
“ Do n’t say diddled , ” Capricorn said .   
Tristan , this time .
“ Sketchy and it does n’t make sense , ” I echoed her words .
“
It ’s sketchy .   
That ’s all .   
It makes plenty of sense , even if I do n’t agree with it .   
And no , I ’m not sharing no details , so go fuck yourselves .   
I do n’t love what Love does all the time , but I respect her enough to keep my gob shut or otherwise occupied while she ’s doing the shit I disagree with .
”
“
Sounds like a compromise , ” Swansong said .   
“
I thought you did n’t believe in compromise , only conquering ?
”
“
Fuck you !   
I also believe in fucking class , which is why I gave your skinny white derriere the benefit of a doubt .   
It ’s why I ’m behind
Love all the way .
”
“
You ’re white too ,
” Capricorn observed .
“
And I have an ass .
”
“ Betrayal and undercover action is fair in the game , Sidepiece , ” Swansong said .   
“
But the guns are n’t supposed to be part of it .   
You know that .
”
“
The game ’s done , Damsel .   
The game got fucked backwards when the world ended .   
And you , doing this ?   
You ’re fucking it worse .
”
“
How does that make sense ?
” I asked .
“ Coming after us ?   
Look at what ’s happening everywhere !   
Fucking heroes banding together under the Wardens ?   
You ’ve got the four teams that nobody really cares about , some corporates , some mercs who are the only ones I could maybe respect .   
You assholes .   
And then the villains .   
Everyone under one banner , and the ones who are n’t signing up with Brattletale , Goddess , Teacher or the evil Mayor ?   
What do you think happens to them ?   
To us ?
”
Her toe moved , indicating Disjoint and herself .   
Shortcut ’s weapon moved in reaction to the toe moving .
“
Us , ” I said .
“
Fucking you !   
Fucking heroes !   
Leaving us no choice    but to band together with the top tier organized crime .   
They ’re the groups that know who to put where and how to stay out of your sight or keep their people out of the way .   
And the rest of us get picked off .   
You wanna fuck us ?   
Then you perpetuate a survival of the unfucked !
”
“
I did miss you , ” Swansong commented .
“
Well fuck you
, it ’s your own fault
you do n’t get any of this for company .
”
Sidepiece wiggled on the spot .   
Shortcut moved his polearm in a warning .
“ I missed your brain and your wit .   
That belongs to Disjoint , ” Swansong .
“
This belongs to me .
”
“ I stand corrected .
”
Spright cleared his throat .   
“
Let ’s get back on track .
”
Looking at Shortcut , I could see that his face was visibly red .   
He was that steamed .   
I would have suggested he take a breather , but I was pretty sure that if I did , he ’d be pointing that weapon of his at me .
He did n’t like the digressions .   
Which meant he was falling one hundred percent into Sidepiece ’s trap .   
After being warned about it .
“
I want a lawyer before we go any further , ” Sidepiece said .   
“
Oh wait , they ’re all dead .   
The fucking world ended .   
So let us fucking have our fun and kick some ass and go focus on the stuff that actually matters .
”
“
You ’ve killed people , ” Capricorn said .
“
Allegedly .   
And in this alleged situation I might have tossed a bit of spinal sheath into a moving vehicle and allegedly killed a bunch of people who got high off of my drugs that I ’d already paid for .   
They tried to give me seven tenths of what I ordered and tried to pass it off as all the tenths .   
Allegedly .   
They did n’t deserve to draw breath .
”
“ I did n’t think you used , ” Swansong said .
“ Only a bit , and never my own supply .   
But I ’ll sell if people want .   
It ’s more samaritan shit than what you fucks are pulling right now .   
Letting some poor , hurting people numb the pain for a while .
”
“ Allegedly , ” Disjoint said .
“ Allegedly , ” Sidepiece added .
“
Those are n’t magic words that absolve you of guilt , ” Rain said .
While they chattered , I checked my phone
and I saw the series of replies-
I had n’t noticed the buzz .
Natalie ( Lawyer ) : 

I asked people about taking in s.piece or joint . 

There is no room .   
Jails over capacity .   
Homes and apartments in populated areas being used as temporary accommodations . 

Do not want minor villains unless lasting injury or murder AND ironclad evidence that can rush them thru system . 

Gang leader yes s.piece or joint is a no . 

Sorry .
I got the attention of the others and showed them .   
Capricorn and Sveta first , then Spright and Ashley .
Jesus .   
This was Wild West shit .   
It just kept getting worse .
“ News ?
” Sidepiece asked .
I beckoned for Rain to come , and I showed him .
“
What am I missing ?
” Sidepiece asked .
She was n’t even shouting or swearing as much now , but her voice .   
The vocal fry , the weird enunciation , like every word was trying to grab attention ?   
It was giving me a headache , like Disjoint had complained about .
I typed out a message in the text box , while Rain was beside me .   
I let him read it , then showed Spright .
Confirmation from both .
“ Sidepiece , ” I said .
“
Fuck you .
”
“
You ’re kind of right .
”
“
Fuck y- of course I am .   
About everything .   
And fuck yourself .
”
“
What you said about the gangs ?   
People picking off the ones who are n’t folding themselves into organized crime ?
”
“
You ’re amping it up to a hundred today , based on what I heard .   
You heroes .
”
“
You were right , ” I repeated myself .   
“
The reality is that when we showed up at the Center tonight , it was because we wanted to communicate with Love Lost .
”
“ Love does n’t really talk , you know
that right ?
”
“ How does that even work ?
” Spright asked .
“
If it ’s important , she writes it down , prints it out , and hands it out .   
Game plan .   
If it ’s not , why say it ?   
We know
she ’s all class
and she ’s professional as shit .   
If she says jump we jump and it works out .
”
“ So far , ” Swansong said .
“
Oh go fuck yourself .   
You ca n’t even talk .   
She beat you and scared you off .   
That ’s why you ’re talking to me and D.J. , you got lucky and you got us after you rolled our car off the road
and I sprained my lower back .
”
“ You do n’t have a lower back .
”
“
Fuck you .
”
“ We came to talk to Love Lost , ” I said .   
“
Because we have it on good authority that Cradle is likely to take March ’s offer .
”
“ Offer ?
”
“ I ’m willing to bet
Love Lost got the same offer .   
She ’ll know what it means .
”
“
Not if you do n’t tell her , and she ’s not going to accept a meeting with you assholes .
”
“ When we said we were bringing you here to talk , we meant it .   
We ’re letting you go , ” I said .
“ Bullshit .   
Trying to soften me and D.J. up .
”
“ We wanted to get a message to Love Lost .   
You ’re going to take it to her , ” I said .
I saw Shortcut stand a little taller .   
Behind his mask , his eyes went wide , intense .
Yeah , this was never going to go over well with him .   
I ’d left him out of the loop as I ’d filled in the others , and Spright had too .   
I felt pretty validated that Spright was tacitly agreeing with me here .
“ If you want to stir shit up or make this harder than it needs to be , then we could just send the most cooperative of you two .   
Or try leaving a message with one of your crooked cops .
”
“ Sensible cops- ”
“ Allegedly , ” Disjoint added .
“ You keep using that wrong , ”
Lookout said , almost plaintive .   
“ Stop .
”
“
Am I allegedly using it wrong ?
”
“
Yes ! ”
Sidepiece leaned back .   
“
We ’re talking sensible alleged cops who recognize that the only towns that have a shot at making it are ones with protectors .   
And not pussy focus - tested superheroes or asshole freaks like you all , either .   
Actual make - your - enemies - go - away protectors .
”
“
Allegedly , ” Disjoint said , again .   
Lookout crossed her arms , trying to look tough .
“
A - guaranteed - ly , ackshully , ” Sidepiece said , with a dangerous tone .
“
It ’s what we ’re about .   
There can be no allegedly about if we ’re going to grant any protection there .
”
“ Take our message to her , ” I said .   
“ No guns .   
No ground to air lightning cannons .   
Keep it simple .   
But right now , you ’re right , there ’s bigger fish to fry .   
She should keep her head down , be careful about how she ’s treating those enemies .   
Cradle might be after her .
”
“
She ’s not the head - down type , you know .
”
“
Her funeral , then .   
The authorities do want her .   
But for now we want to avoid disaster .   
Cradle coming after her and winning would be a disaster .   
She ’ll know why .
”
“ Uh huh .   
What ’s the catch here ?   
Trading us for info on the new recruits ?
”
“
You ’re not a priority , ” I said .   
I was n’t even lying as I said it .   
If I had my way they ’d be a priority , but I was n’t about to get my way .   
The courts were falling behind .   
Or they had Fallen behind-
the overburdened system had become most noticeable when the compound had been raided .   
“
This is about information and it ’s about keeping the peace .   
We know Love Lost is after Precipice .   
We know what March is doing .   
But if she ’s willing to back off , so will we .
”
“ She does n’t back off , ” Sidepiece said .   
“ Do n’t want to jeopardize my being freed , but I ’d be disrespecting her if I pretended she might .
”
“
It ’s fine .   
We ’re making the offer regardless .   
I ’d rather crack down on the masterminds and big threats .
”
“
While siccing other teams on all the fodder and bottom feeders ?
”
“ They ’ll do what they do .   
We ’re just … organizing better .
”
“
Fuck that .
”
Spright bent down .   
He undid cuffs , freeing Sidepiece ’s hands from behind her head , and Disjoint ’s limbs were uncuffed .   
We ’d cuffed ankle to ankle and ankle to table leg .   
The hands had been cuffed in a way that kept them in view .   
There was n’t anything he could do that was faster than the spear - tip at the head of the halberd could be .
The two were freed , and they climbed to their feet .   
The shitty table nearly broke as Sidepiece leaned on it to stand up .
“
You ’re really letting us go ?
”
“ We ’re letting them go ?
”
Shortcut asked .   
More red faced and pissed off than before .
“
Never let it be said I never do anything nice for you , ” Swansong said .
“ You can still go fuck yourself , ” Sidepiece answered , venom in her voice .   
“
But you can leave the bottle out of it .
”
“ How gracious .
”
“
Yeah , huh ?   
I ’m a sweetheart like that , ” Sidepiece said .   
“
This is n’t a head - game ?   
No tricks ?
”
“
Go , ” Spright said .
“
No tricks , ” I said .
“ The creepy camera girl did n’t put trackers on us ?
”
“
No .   
My stuff is broken , thanks to you guys-
”
“
Do n’t give the enemy information , ” Swansong gently admonished .
“
-and I do n’t need trackers to know everything you do .   
I kind of wish I did n’t know everything you do .
”
“ Creepy as shit little kid , ” Sidepiece said .
Capricorn pulled the sliding door open .   
The battered vehicle that Sidepiece and Disjoint had been driving before being intercepted was parked out in the snow , ice and snow covering the various windows .   
Cold air blasted into a space that had only been tolerably warm because we ’d had so many people inside it .   
Now with the door open , it was cold again .
“
What the fuck ?
”
Shortcut asked Spright .   
I imagined he thought he was being quiet about it , but he was naturally abrasive and loud enough that everyone could hear .
“
Why ?
”
Lookout asked .   
“ Why are we letting them go ?   
Because if I was actually supposed to put trackers on them , I did n’t .
”
“ They do n’t have room for minor villains , ” Capricorn said .
“ They are n’t minor , ” Shortcut said .
I actually agreed with him .   
Places , times , and groups where the more violent enforcers had been active in the last two years had seen more than a few people die .   
Some had been blatant – but only a few of the people responsible for those blatant deaths were still around .   
Nailbiter was a major one .   
A lot more of the deaths had been ambiguous .
Beast of Burden had been active in some out of the way spots , and in the wake of his demise , little things were turning up .   
Deaths that had been missed in the midst of a lethally harsh winter .
Well , a winter like any ordinary one , but it had been a winter we had n’t been equipped to deal with .   
And in places that Beast of Burden and his gang had been throwing their weight around , taking protection money , an awful lot of people had gone out in the cold and died there .
Was it Disjoint and Sidepiece ?   
There was no telling .   
Nailbiter was a killer , and her way of killing people left enough of a trail that if we got her we ’d be able to send her straight through to a jail … where nobody would be able to hold her .
Which meant that if we got her , we ’d check with the authorities , sketchy as the woman at the top might be , and with some luck Nailbiter would cease to be a concern .
I did n’t love it , but I was really hard - pressed to think of a better solution .
“ We ’re going , ” Spright said .   
He produced his grapple - tendrils , floated up into the air a bit , and the air began to ripple around him .
Off to the side , I saw Sveta scowl .   
I rarely saw her outright scowl .
“
Thanks for this , ” I told Spright .   
“
Sorry it was n’t for much .
”
“ Not very forthcoming .   
Some hints on how they ’re operating .   
Motivation .   
Gives us ideas on how to take them down next time .
”
“ We ’ll compile our notes and share , ” I said .
“ Sounds good .
”
I shook hands with Spright , and then we watched as the two of them took off .   
They skated away , leaving ripples behind them , Spright using tendrils to haul himself forward .
“
I ca n’t stand him , ” Sveta said .
“ I hear you , ” I said .
“ Stealing my power without asking and then being better at it than me ?
” I nodded .   
I took her hand and gave it a light shake .
“ I ca n’t help but notice that we ’re making deals with Tattletale , and we ’re making deals with Love Lost , ” Rain asked .
“
They ’re not really deals , ” Tristan said .   
“
They ’re pretty hollow .   
We say we ’ll leave Tattletale alone unless she does something that deserves being brought in .
”
“
Which means nothing , ” Ashley said .   
“ Why would she accept ?
”
I flexed my hand .   
The cold was making the burned and bandaged skin sore .   
I was overdue for a debriding .
When I spoke , I was staring out at the distant city .   
“
She accepts because she wants to know that she can do what she ’s currently doing without being brought in by us .   
And maybe she gets an edge if someone else brings her in
and she mentions the deal .   
Makes us look bad .   
But it ’s worth it , to get the information , flawed as it might be .   
She probably had other strategies in mind .
”
“
Or she ’s high on painkillers and her head is fuzzy , ” Sveta said .
“ Or that .
”
“
And this ?
”
Rain asked .








“ Bluuuuurggh , ” Crystal said , as we left the station .
“ Blurgh , ” I responded .   
“
Cold enough for you ?
”
“
It was seventy - four degrees out where we were stationed !   
What is this ?   
Why ca n’t it be warm all the time everywhere ?
”
I smiled-
not just because Crystal was being silly , but because I could see the crowd filtering out of the station .   
I was pretty used to the looks a cape got in public , and Weld , Laserdream
and I were all costumed or known capes .   
It was pretty obvious when I compared the attention we got from some compared to the lone individuals who did n’t give half as many shits .
The latter group had either worked closely with capes for a long time , or they were capes themselves .
“
So , ” Crystal said .   
“ How you been ,
cuz ?   
Because I ca n’t help but notice that you went and hurt your other arm .   
Hand .   
Whatever .
”
“ We ran into a parahuman who burns powers .   
Sets forcefields and auras on fire .   
That was a thing .   
And Lung was there .   
I do n’t suppose you had any access to Gimel news ?   
TV ?
”
She shook her head .   
Her expression was nearly blank , but her eyebrows were up toward the center , creating a line of wrinkle on her forehead .
“
Do n’t make that face .
”
She reached up and adjusted her hair a bit , so the part that swooped down over one half of her forehead and one eye now covered the eyebrows and some of her other eye .   
Still making the face , just hiding it .
I elbowed her while she was still adjusting , and her hair came loose of the hairband .
“
It was a thing .   
Goddess against Teacher .   
Gimel caught in the middle .   
Monokeros , you know her ?   
She was a thing a while back .
”
She took a second , bending over so her hair draped down , so she could then comb it with her fingers and arrange it , before fixing her hairband into place to lock its position .   
A single finger helped adjust the curve of hair to where it tucked behind her ear .
She straightened , and then gave me a serious look .   
“
You know what you sound like right now
, right ?   
But it was n’t a dream !   
It was a place !   
And this guy was there , and her , and him , they were all there !   
But they could n’t have been , Auntie Em !
”
Crystal put her hands to her cheeks as she finished it .
“
I wish it was a dream , ” I said .   
“
It was a mess .   
I ’ll fill you in on it later .
”
“
Great .
”
“ Or not .   
You could find out by browsing the web- ” “ Blegh , internet .
”
“ -finding a video of our tv
appearance-
”
She perked up .   
“
Oh hey !   
That ’s good !   
Neat !
”
“
Not good , ” Sveta commented .   
“
Necessary , but not pretty . ”
“
Oh no , ” Crystal said .   
She ’d gone from excited to crestfallen in a second .   
Even borderline horrified .   
“
Because ‘ necessary ‘ always means good things .   
We just finished a stint of necessary .
”
“
They were pulling a media hit job on one of our team members , ” I said .
“
Who is they ?   
What group , or what show ?
”
“
No idea and Hardboil .   
On Lookout .
”
Crystal made a face .   
“
Even if it was them , why was n’t it pretty ?   
You ’re supposed to be good at this stuff , cuz !   
And you have Capricorn !   
He ’s done media appearances before , and he ’s good at it !
”
Someone looked him up , I thought .
“
Sorry to butt in , ” Sveta said .   
“
Did n’t mean to get you in trouble , Victoria .
”
“
No , ” Crystal said .   
“
No , you ’re fine .   
You can butt in all you like .   
You ’re as good as family .
” Sveta blinked .
Weld put one arm around her .   
“
I heard about the TV show .   
The prison .
”
“
It ’s nice to know they keep you in the loop , ” Crystal said , sticking out her tongue at him .
“ Leave that group of yours and join the Wardens .   
We ’ll take care of you , ” Weld said .
“ Tempting , ” she said .   
“ Prison ?
”
“
It was one thing among … a lot of things , ” I said .
“
I ’m glad you ’re not too badly hurt , ” Weld said .
“ Somewhat traumatized , but we ’re mostly fine , ” Sveta said , hugging him back .   
“
We lost a teammate .   
Cryptid .   
Not- not
dead .   
But he left .
”
She ’d stumbled over her words in her haste to clarify that ‘ lost’ was n’t dead .
It put me in mind of the Leviathan attack .   
‘ Losses’ .   
The word had haunted me for a while , until other moments and things had taken over .   
Such a horribly ambiguous word .
“
Half of you did n’t have names when I left , ”
Crystal reminded us .
“ One of the younger two .   
Not the camera tinker .   
Our changer .
”
“ I vaguely recall .   
I might be sharper if it was n’t nearly midnight .
”
“
It ’s past midnight , ” Sveta said .
“ Fucking time zones .   
So you were on television and you fucked it
up-
” I elbowed her again .   
“
It was n’t great from a PR standpoint , but we did what we needed to .   
Got heroes on our side , saved Lookout from being the focus .
”
“
Fine .   
Conceded .   
But you fought our hometown dragon boy and lost , judging by that burn- ”
“
Won .   
I did pretty fucking awesome , actually .
”
“ You won against Lung .   
Right .   
Really helping your case , here ,
Miss ‘ this was n’t a fever dream’ .
”
I moved to elbow her again , and hit a square of forcefield .
“ Fought Teacher , fought Goddess .   
I have a hundred texts from Aunt Carol , who was no doubt trying to see if she could reach me and use me to steer you back on course-
”
“
No comment , ” I said .
“ And twenty texts from your dad , who was interpreting Auntie C ’s actions or crisis managing .
”
“ Fair bit of crisis managing , I think .   
I saw Amy , ” I murmured to Crystal .
“
Oh , ” she said , and the levity where she ’d been making fun of how hectic we ’d been and complaining in good fun was all gone .   
“
How was that ?
”
A very careful , neutral question .
“
Not well .   
She left .
”
“
Left … ?
”
“ Gimel .   
She and Marquis left to take a leadership role in another Earth .   
With Cryptid .
” Crystal nodded .   
“
Your dad said Marquis was active on Earth N.    It would make sense for him to take a firmer hand , go to Earth N-
” I was shaking my head .   
Sveta added a , “ No , ” for good measure .
“
Another uninhabited Earth , using the skills he learned , then .
”
“ Inhabited , ” Sveta said .   
“ Shin .
”
Crystal ’s uncovered eye bugged out .   
“
That ’s Goddess’ .
”
“
Was .   
Amy , Marquis , Cryptid now .
”
“
We do n’t know how far they ’re going with it , ” Sveta added .
Crystal did n’t have a retort for once .
“
It ’s okay , ” I said .   
“
That ’s a mess that ’s going to have to be dealt with sometime , but not today .   
As shitty as it is to say , it ’s a load off my mind that she ’s not here .
”
“ I do n’t think it ’s shitty , ” Sveta said .   
“
You ’ve been more at ease since all that .
” I shrugged and gave Sveta a smile .   
I turned more attention to Weld , who was apparently pretty content holding his girlfriend , his attention half on us and half on the crowd .   
He saw me looking .
“ Vista .
”
I perked up , looking .
“
She ’s just talking to her dad now .   
She was with her mom earlier , and her parents ca n’t stand to be in the same place at the same time .
”
“
And even when she sees each of them separately , it ’s about who she saw first , who she saw longest
…   
I guess that ’s not better ?
”
Vista was out of costume .   
She looked so different .   
Her hair was n’t straight , she had eyeliner on , and she had a fair number of freckles
– more than usual .   
No waterproof makeup covering it up and changing her complexion , nose , and brow shape either .   
There was n’t a trace of the old green and blue of her costume in her outfit , either .   
She wore a black sweatshirt over maroon scrubs that might have been medical scrubs , and wore a jacket and scarf over that .   
Given her age , she would be pretending to be part of the medical block student group .   
Helping out with supplies and first - aid for special credit ?
Whatever the excuse or story was , she looked just enough like someone with a job that it did n’t draw attention , and the job was n’t one that got in the way of her personal identity .
It sucked to see that her dad was showing so very little joy at seeing her , though .
She looked our way
and I gave her a little wave .   
I did n’t want to break her cover , but-
-But
apparently that was excuse enough for her to break away from her dad .   
She hurried off , and not toward us .   
She nudged some other people , and they headed our way .
These people- not familiar to me .   
I was left trying to guess who they were .   
A guy and a girl .
Browbeat ?   
Could n’t and would n’t be Chariot .   
Too young to be Trainwreck .   
He looked military - esque , but he was also … sturdy .   
Not so fat , tall , or muscular in a way that I could point to any one of the things being responsible for my estimation of him , but a fair bit of all of those things .   
His choice of clothes did n’t work against that , either .   
Beanie , a leather jacket that was less fashion and more the kind of thing
a blue collar worker bought if he expected to work outside , jeans that were n’t slim - fit or even regular fit , and heavy boots .
And he looked wholly comfortable in all of it .
His lady friend was a stark contrast .   
She wore a white wrap coat with gray fur trim and a silver chain extending along the front like a piece of jewelry that had been built into the coat .   
There were other decorative elements at the wrists .   
Black jeans , and gray suede boots that I could hear as they tapped on the ice and road .   
Her hair was in a ponytail , but I could see wisps of black hair escaping .   
It was rare to see hair that fine and that black .
“
Hi big V , hi Crystal , ” Missy said , after she had dragged them along enough .   
She was still fairly petite , though far less than she once had been , obviously , but it stood out with the company she kept , especially the guy .   
It did n’t help that the two were so straight - backed , and Missy was hunched over against the cold .
I hugged her .   
She smiled as she broke the hug .   
“
Hi Missy .
”
“
You can call me whatever .   
This is , uh , Theo and Ava .   
I just realized I did n’t ask first about identities .
”
I put out my hand to shake theirs .   
Theo accepted first .
“ Glory Girl , hi , ” Theo said .   
“
I was a fan when I was a kid .   
Laserdream , wow .
”
“ I think I win , ” Crystal whispered .   
She threw up a forcefield , expecting a jab that I did n’t bother to deliver .
“
I ’m
Golem , ” he said .   
“
And I would n’t blame you if you did n’t know the name .
”
“ I know the name , ” I said .
“ I know too , ” Sveta said .   
“
But if I said how , you ’d think I was weird .
”
“
Weird why ?
” Theo asked .
“
If I said J.Y. , would that mean anything to you ?   
Staff ?
”
“
Yyyes ?
”
“
She was one of a very small number of people who looked after me .   
So when she said she went to a town , I looked up the teams there .
”
“ Ahh , ” Theo said .   
He wrinkled his nose .   
“ Not too weird .
”
“
I ’ll settle for that , ” Sveta said .
“ Cuff , ” Ava introduced herself to me and Sveta .   
At Sveta ’s handshake , she extended a look down .   
“
That ’s quite a hand … shake .
”
“
You ’re the Chicago Wards , ” Sveta said , matching Ava ’s tone of intrigued surprise .
“ When a lot of people make that connection , they ’ll add something to it , ” Ava said .   
“ Chicago Wards , Weaver ’s team .   
Or Chicago Wards , the people from the New Delhi video .
”
I shook my head .   
“ Chicago Wards , did what few teams besides New York were doing and organized a roster with a strategy .
”
“ That was in the New Delhi video , ” Ava said .   
“
I ’m pretty sure .
”
“ If it was , it was something you guys were doing before the video , before Weaver , and I was paying attention back then .
”
“
Well , on behalf of Tecton , I ’m touched , ” Ava said .
“
It ’s tough .   
Damned by association , like Brockton Bay and the Undersiders , ” Missy said .   
“
Theo ’s from Brockton Bay originally .
”
“
When did you get out ?
” I asked .
“ Around the time the Slaughterhouse Nine arrived .
”
“
Good move , ” Crystal said .
“ I like getting together with all of the old Brockton Bay people , ” Vista said .   
She huffed breath into her hands , then adjusted her scarf .   
When it did n’t adjust the way she wanted it to , she warped its dimensions .   
“
Feels like
I ’m
putting a puzzle back together .   
Everyone always has questions they never got to get answers to , you know ?   
Except Rachel Lindt ’s one of the people I keep meeting up with , and she ’s not a question and answer kind of person .
”
“
Tattletale ’s the one I keep running into , ” I muttered .   
“
She is a question and answer kind of person , and it sucks .
” Vista smiled .   
“ Does n’t it ?   
I tried to reach out , get her in on the reuniting thing .   
Offered my hand in friendship , and she went straight for the jugular .   
She seems happy being a villain .   
Same type as Shadow Stalker , I think .
” I shrugged .   
There were a hundred things I could say to that , and figuring Tattletale out was something I could see a whole lot of merit in , if Vista ever wanted to get together and compare notes , do what she was talking about and getting answers .   
But that felt like a whole - day thing to unpack and figure out .   
Not a well - past - midnight thing .
But on the surface ?   
I ’d known Shadow Stalker briefly , and she had been kind of nice to be around when she ’d had reason to be nice .   
I could believe that Tattletale was the same .   
But I knew just how shitty they could be when upset- Shadow Stalker broke faces , and Tattletale destroyed psyches .   
Shadow Stalker stuck relentlessly to a path and as shitty as she was at her core , however easily or excellently she could be a villain , she valued being a vigilante - type , and from what I knew about her , that would n’t change , however she was tempted .   
Being a vigilante served her ends , it served her ego , and it validated her at her core .
Tattletale had helped the city and in some twisted world where the chips had fallen down differently , she could have been a hero .   
There was a distinction , even , that she cared about shit that was n’t herself a lot more than Shadow Stalker ever had .   
But being a villain served her ends , it served her ego , and it validated her at her core .
The others were chatting .   
Talking about the travel .   
Vista looked happy , and Sveta seemed very content .
Amusing to see that Theo was just a little bigger than Weld in physical dimensions .   
Weld was usually the heavyweight in the room .   
He still was , by a wide margin , but someone squinting their eyes would n’t have known it .
“
Do you guys want to go somewhere warmer ?
”
Crystal asked .   
“
I bet we could find a place willing to serve us drinks-
”
“
I ’m still too young , ” Vista said .
“ Coffee then ?   
Anyone ?
”
I saw Sveta and Weld exchange a look .
“
I ’m looking forward to getting home , ” Weld said .   
“ Getting warm .
”
“
The cold bothers you ?
”
Ava asked .   
“
I did n’t think much did .
”
“ Slows me down , ” Weld said .   
“ A little stiff in the joints .
”
“
Let ’s get you home to a heated mattress .   
I got everything out that we set up last winter , tested it , made sure there were no shorts in the wiring , ” Sveta said , breaking away from the hug , taking one of Weld
’s hands in hers and swaying a bit .   
“
Some heated blankets with metal plates , music .
”
“ Please .   
You ’ve got to catch me up on what I missed .
”
“
I ’ve been saving stuff , mister , ” Sveta said .   
“
As requested .   
Doing what little I can to look after you .
”
Weld pulled his fist close to his chest , and with Sveta holding onto it with both hands , drew her close enough that he could put his other arm around her .   
He looked to Crystal .
“ Drinks another time .
”
“
Another time for sure .   
When ’s your birthday , Missy ?
”
“ Not soon .   
May fifteenth .   
But I ’ll be eighteen then .
”
“
Let ’s do a Brockton Bay reunion then .
”
“ We ’ll take you for a first drink , ” Crystal said .
“
That sounds nice .   
I know this is a weird question , but what would you think if I invited Rachel Lindt ?
”
“
Do you think she ’d accept ?
” Theo asked .
“ I do n’t know .   
She might only swing by if I bribe her .   
But I think it would be important if we could show her that we do n’t have it in for her .
”
Missy looked at me as she said the last bit .
“
You ’re vouching for her ?
”
“
Yeah .   
And Miss Militia would too .
”
“
Then sure . ”
Missy smiled .
Sveta and Weld said their goodbyes .
“ I am catching a ride with … someone , ” Vista said .   
“ Procrastinating on that decision .   
No coffee for me .   
I ’m just glad I get to say hi .
”
“ I wanted to say , ” Theo said .   
“ Victoria , uh … thank you ?
”
“
For what ?
”
“
This is a weird thing to bring up .   
But back when I was just in my first year of High School , you went after the gangs pretty hard .
” I winced .
“
The Empire in particular ?
”
“ I regret how I went about that , ” I said .
“ You should n’t , ” he said .   
“
You know how you can be raised one way , and you do n’t second guess it until you have a reason to ?
”
I thought of Rain .   
I nodded .
“
I was raised by those guys , ” he said .   
“
I do n’t know how much I believed , but I went along with it for a while , because I was still in that kid state of mind , where you think if you do n’t get something and the adults act like they do
, they ’re probably right ?
”
“
Sure , ” I said .   
“
I think I can relate to that .
”
“ I remember when one guy , Thor , no powers , he just changed his name from something lame like Lester , he got carted back with a few broken bones .
”
“ You were that close to their operations ?
” I asked .   
I connected two thoughts .   
His power-
“
You ’re second gen .   
Allfather ?   
Or would you rather not say ?
”
“ I do n’t mind saying .   
Nah , not Allfather , that would have been weird .   
Kaiser and Heith .
”
“
Oh yeah .   
I guess I pictured the older guy having a kid instead of the … twenty year old , I guess ?   
Thereabouts ?
”
“
Yeah .   
Thereabouts .
”
“
Sorry , I ’m getting nerdy and … inaccurate .
”
“
Very inaccurate , ” Crystal said .
“
It ’s late , ” I said .   
“
Sorry .   
You were saying ?
”
“ The guy came back hurt
and I was happy about it .   
Fucker deserved it .   
Realizing I was happy was n’t when I realized I did n’t like the Empire .   
But it was step seven or eight in ten steps ?   
I do n’t know how I would have ended up if I had n’t had that .   
If I ’d missed a step or two or three .
” I nodded .
“ Some of them ended up in the Shepherds , y’know ?
” he asked .
“
Yeah .   
That came up at one point .   
I have n’t run into them yet , but I did have a run in with the Shepherds .
”
“ I remember you geeking out one time , ” Crystal said .   
“ Remember ?   
You were telling me all about how Masters have interpersonal problems and Shakers have issues feeling secure-
”
“
Ahem , ” Vista said .
“
-and tinkers dwell …
”
“
You got shakers wrong , ”
I pointed out .   
My phone was buzzing in my pocket , so I pulled it out , without looking at it .   
“
What are you getting at ?
”
“
Maybe .   
I ’m starting to think you ’ve got a Brute thing going , Victoria .   
Because you have run - ins with everyone and crash through everything .   
Everything .
”
I rolled my eyes .   
I checked my phone .   
Kenzie .
“
Got ta take this , ” I said .
“
Yeah , you know I got your goat .
”
I waited until I was mostly out of earshot to answer .   
“
I ’m here .
”
Kenzie ’s voice came across with both enthusiasm and a slight hush , like she did n’t want to wake up someone nearby .   
“
Hi .   
Sorry to call so late , but I see you ’re still at the station , and something came up .
”
I looked around for the camera .
“ Seven and a half o’clock , if the station entrance is twelve .
”
I turned myself around , looked , and spotted it .
“
What happened ?
”
“
Okay , so um , first of all , Tattletale was peeking in .   
I tried to say hi , open a dialogue , and she went dark .   
But I thought you should know .
”
“
Watching us ?   
Okay .
”
“ Watching everyone , I think .   
The camera was n’t too interested in us , and when it looked like it was , I thought I ’d do the digital handshake .   
I might ’ve stepped in sooner
but I was changing for bed and brushing my teeth .
”
“ You need to go to sleep sooner .
”
“ I know !   
But I wanted to organize my stuff , take apart my broken camera and sort the components away , and I got carried away .
”
“
What ’s the other thing ?
”
“
Dead bodies .   
Heroes from your tracking program .
” I found myself holding my breath .   
“
Who ?
” I did n’t want to hear .   
I did n’t want to know .
“ Slingstone , Nailfarer and Scaffold .
”
“ Navigators .   
That ’s not far from Brockton Bay .   
Tell me where .
”
“ I can give you coordinates .   
I ’ll send it to you and you can click the link to have it go up as a flag on your map exec .
”
“ Thank you .
”
“
I ’m glad to help .   
Um , and Victoria ?
”
The tone suggested she was preparing to deliver more bad news .
“ Hit me with it .
”
“
There ’s chatter on the lines .   
Villains know it happened , and they seem split on what they ’re going to do about it .
”
“
The game .   
I know it does n’t count for much these days , but … there are rules we all follow .
”
“
That ’s the chatter .   
Some like the decisive action .   
Some hate it .   
They ’re calling a halt to all activity for now
and they ’re going to hold a meeting tomorrow to figure out how to handle this .   
Whether they allow it .
”
Or encourage it .   
We need to figure out
how -we- handle this .
“
Thanks , Kenzie .   
But you should really be in bed .
”
“
This is important .   
I was going to ask if I should stay up .   
I can be comms .
”
“
How long would it take you to get a message out to all the teams ?
”
“
A minute .
”
“ Tell them to stand down .   
If the villains are going quiet , it should be fine .
”
“
Can I say it ’s an emergency ?
”
“
Yeah .   
Might be good .   
Have someone who ’s
awake double - check what you wrote before you mass - send .   
Not Sveta .   
Let her have her night with Weld .
”
“
Got it .
”
I rejoined the others .
“ You look serious , ” Crystal said .
“ Some capes got killed .   
Heroes .   
We were trying to interconnect , share information , figure out a way to deal with the villains , now that the prison is gone .
”
She cleared her throat .   
“
Gone ?
” I sighed .
“ I ’ll come .
”
“ You just got back from-
”
“ From classified , ” she said .   
“ I ’ll come .
”
She was n’t the only one who wanted to .
⊙ We were close to Brockton Bay , and a part of me had hoped we ’d run into Senior Trooper Littlejohn again .   
I ’d at least established some rapport with him .
Police cars had been stopped around the site , and though the sirens were off , the lights did flash .   
The scattered parts were lit up with the stark glare of headlights from one side and strobing red and blue from another .
It was only thanks to Vista that the truck could keep pace with Crystal and I.   
We ’d arrived on the scene as a group .   
I was out of costume , because I had n’t really planned to get into any trouble .   
I floated , so I was an obvious cape , but that was it .   
The others had changed .
To a horror scene .   
People butchered .   
Cops standing by and trying to stay warm while the wind whipped aggressively past us , some techs were pacing the field , planting little yellow flags by each piece of a body , and the lights being almost solely from the cars made the scene an isolated image on a page otherwise painted black .
What did it say , that of Vista , of Laserdream , of Golem , Cuff , and I , we ’d seen bad enough things that an unrecognizable assortment of human parts was n’t enough to shake us ?
“
Who ’s in charge ?
” I asked .
Fingers pointed .
I floated over , so my feet would n’t contaminate the scene .   
A new face , a new set of expectations and prejudices to wrangle .
“
Can we look ?
”
She seemed to take her time considering , until Golem flashed his Wardens badge .
“
Be my guest , ” the woman said .   
“
We ’re taking our photos and our notes , but this looks like costume on costume crime .   
We ’re not equipped for it .
”
“ They were heroes .   
These ones were good guys who saved lives , ” I said .   
“
They worked with the system , they worked with police .
”
“ I ’m sympathetic , I really am , ” she said .   
“
But we ’re not equipped .
”
I was left kind of speechless .   
A shift in the light drew my attention- Vista was enlarging the car headlights , and it looked like she was bending the beams , illuminating the scene .
“
I ’ll put it back before we go , ” she told the officer driving the car .
No response .
The Navigators had passed through Hollow Point briefly .   
They ’d been just far enough away that we had n’t had much more cause to interact with them .   
Too small , too narrow in their focus .
Nailfarer had a weird name , but it was based in legend , and she ’d been candid in interviews about why .   
She had talked about her trigger event at a time when such things had been discouraged .   
Her parents and aunt had boarded a ship to America , convinced by shady individuals that it was by legitimate channels .   
Mock tests , mock papers , and fair amounts of money .   
They had boarded a ship and then been shuttled into a cargo container .   
One of several .
She and her family members had been let out to work the ship or provide services to the crew .   
They were slated to be slaves , and this was a beginning to their new lives .   
She saw her oldest family members die , heard from others that they ’d been thrown overboard .   
She ’d seen younger family members die too – alive but dead inside .
She ’d gained powers , she ’d fought , and she ’d lost against sheer numbers .   
She ’d been beaten into submission and made to serve for three months as an enforcer before fighting her way out .
For ten years , she ’d been a hero .   
Her name more a reference to where she came from than her ability to turn dead tissues into doors .
“ Fuck , ” I said , as I looked over the scene .   
She ’d been torn into fifty pieces .   
Some were in the branches of a tree above , now brightly illuminated after Vista had adjusted the light .
“
Found a murder weapon , ” Golem said .   
“ Shovel , wooden handle .   
It ’s buried .
”
Police officers jogged over to investigate .
Did n’t narrow things down , I was pretty sure .   
Nothing jumped to mind .
Slingstone … he had n’t been as cavalier about his background .   
He ’d gone after the big guys .   
He was ex - Haven and had n’t been open about why , and he ’d dodged the Shepherds , presumably being close - mouthed about his decision there .   
He was ‘ boring’ by how he looked on paper .   
A blaster , a single shot at a time , softball sized ‘ stones’ .   
They flew in straight lines at high velocities and were really , really good at breaking through and shattering the inorganic , including armor .
But he ’d fought Endbringers , traveling overseas to do it .   
A year before Leviathan had hit Brockton Bay , Slingstone had been hurt in an Endbringer fight , and he ’d taken a break .   
He ’d resumed activities just in time for the world to end .
The individual pieces of his body were mixed in with Nailfarer ’s and Scaffold ’s .   
Streaks of blood suggested the directions by which they ’d been thrown .
Multiple sizes of footprint suggested that members of the team had waded through the gore of the first one to die … or that there had been multiple attackers .
“ Cuff , do you have any metal ?   
I need a chunk you do n’t care about , ” Laserdream said .
Cuff tossed something to her .
The team had n’t been much of a cape against cape group .   
They ’d focused more on mundane gangs and criminal organizations , with Slingstone being the one to go up against Endbringers and challenge the powered enforcers .
In a lot of ways , they ’d been closer to police than capes .   
They ’d been offered positions in the Guild , an international organization rooted in Canada , very cause - driven and mission - focused .   
They ’d turned it down , allegedly because it was still too much about image , and they just wanted to work .
Who or what came after you , and why ?
The location was important .   
That I ’d been pretty fucking close to here in the last twenty - four hours was important .   
I knew it was bad to decide who the culprit was before all the evidence came in , but Love Lost ’s group had members who were willing and able to do something this savage , and she was n’t situated that far away .
March ’s group could blow people to smithereens and take people to pieces , and they ’d been close , earlier in the day .
“ Victoria , ” Laserdream said .
I flew over in her direction .   
Below her , Scaffold was more intact than the rest .   
Head and torso were impaled on the mangled architecture that he ’d created with his power .   
His parts were strewn about as the others were , red and glistening .
Created and altered building layouts .   
Slide a wall this way , raise up a wall where there was none .   
Trapdoors and cover as it was needed .
General use wall and forcefield powers , as I understood it , came about most often from trigger events that involved ambient , environmental threats to people or things the trigger victim wanted to protect .
Aunt Sarah had it as a power .   
So did Crystal .   
So had Eric .
Me and my mom ?   
Not so much .
Well , I had something closer to my cousins than anything , now .   
It had changed .   
I could n’t quite allow myself to think it counted .
Scaffold had been in a bad place and wanted to protect someone from the place or situation .   
Probably .   
He ’d dedicated his life to going up against gangs and criminal organizations , though he ’d been alone in the group in being as vocal as he ’d been about corrupt governments , police departments , hero groups , and school administrations .   
He ’d been the original reason the Guild had reached out ; they liked causes .
Laserdream had Cuff ’s piece of metal set in a bowl of forcefield , and was firing a laser at it .   
The metal glowed white hot , and she had her hands cupped around it with the one middle finger pointed more in than the others , to supply the laser .
“
The cuts , ” Laserdream said .   
“
Those are claw marks .
” I flew closer to see , while she floated above , warming her hands with a grim look on her face .
“
I know your eyes are n’t as good as my one eye , but I see footprints , Victoria .
”
“ Point ?
”
She provided a thin beam , laser pointer style , to indicate .
These footprints were n’t human .   
Long and two - toed , pressing deep into the frozen ground like the source was heavy .
“ Minion ?
” I asked .
“ Could be .   
Could be , um , do you remember mentioning that Prancer was bringing in some Case - fifty - threes to screw with Sveta ?
”
“
It ’s possible .   
A bit of a reach- they did n’t come to the Fallen raid
and I think they left .
”
The shovel .   
One had had a shovel .   
Sveta had mentioned her , but had n’t mentioned if she ’d lived .
I winced .   
Cross that bridge when we came to it .
Scaffold had been lifted up , and thrown down onto his namesake construction .   
Had he been clawed before or after ?   
If it was before , then this had been for the drama of it , to create a show .   
If it was after , it suggested something personal , retaliating or expressing anger in a futile way .
One claw swipe had practically severed head from upper body .
Finished off ?   
Given a merciful death ?
I saw how red the blood of the wound was .
I looked at the cops , many hunkering inside their cars or by the doors , trying to stay warm .   
At Crystal , who was holding her hands above the heated metal .
“
How long has the scene been like this ?
”
I asked , raising my voice to be heard by the woman in charge .
“ We arrived half an hour ago .
”
The blood was too red .   
It had n’t frozen .   
Snow had collected on it , but it had n’t frozen .
“ Shit , ”
I said , with enough vehemence that just about everyone stopped in their tracks .
I flew straight to Scaffold .   
I put my hand over his mouth .
No breath , but I could feel the warmth .
At the wound in the neck- there , I could feel the breath .
I touched his face , and I wiped the snow away from the eyes .
“
Hey !
”   
This from the woman in charge .
I ignored her .   
My eyes were fixed on him .  
Scaffold , half his stomach , one arm , and everything below the waist missing , his jaw unhinged , crushed his eyes closed , then opened them .   
His eyes met mine , wavering like he could n’t really see me half the time .
“ We need medical attention !
” I shouted .   
“
He ’s alive !
”
Oh no , I thought .   
He ’s alive , and he has no power that ’s anything like that .
He had no right or ability to be alive , which meant-
Horror surged through me as I flew over the field .   
People were rushing to Scaffold , and I was rushing to find a piece of meat that I could recognize .
A quarter of a human head , a fragment of mask clinging to it by stubbornness and the stickiness of gore more than by mechanics .   
A single eye .
I turned it , so the eye faced the headlight .   
The pupil narrowed .
“
They ’re all alive !
” I shouted .   
“
It might be every piece !
”
They ’d been hanging back , everything happening slowly , sticking together for numbers against a parahuman threat , and to provide light .   
Now they were acting , everyone in motion .   
Nobody with any idea what to do .
The woman in charge had to shout at people who were heading to the bushes to throw up , because pieces had been strewn so far and wide across the field that there might be some in the bushes .
When she was done shouting , and when most people had their orders or had decided they ’d be useless , the woman was left leaning against the hood of her car , hands in her pockets , her eyes wide .
“
They said something was off , ” she muttered .   
“
I figured powers , right ?
”
I pressed my lips closed , watching .   
At this stage I was n’t sure what to do that would n’t put me in the way .
“
What do I even do ?
” she asked .
“ We see if we can put them back together , or if we can give them mercy , ” I said .
“ I meant … this is going to be a nightmare , with everything that ’s already going on .
”
I could picture
Love
Lost
’s group .   
I remembered Sidepiece ’s words about the state of the itinerant villain .








“ B.    Alright .   
Which half ?   
Again .   
Alright .   
T , u- .   
Alright .   
Ambulance ?   
Ambush ?   
Ambush it is .   
I ’m going to write that down .
”
My voice did n’t sound like mine , as I went through the steps .   
Robotic , methodical , motivated rather than cheer .   
No , cheer was the polar opposite of the emotion that touched my voice .   
Harrowed fit better .   
My finger shook as I moved it to the screen of my phone , to the point where I missed the ‘ A’ .
Beside me , Crystal rubbed my shoulder and back .   
“
Do you want me to take over ?
”
I shook my head .   
Stubbornly , I backed out of the special characters bubble and returned to the keyboard .   
I hit the ‘ A’ with more deliberation .
I looked up from the screen .   
A white cloth had been laid out in the emergency tent , between a plastic sheet and a stretcher .   
A black outline marked a loose human form , and the parts that had been found and identified were laid out on the stretcher .   
The area of the plastic sheet outside of that outlined figure was littered with rows and columns of unidentifiable segments that had been attributed to Nailfarer specifically .
“ You did n’t see their faces ?
”
I asked the segment of Nailfarer ’s head .   
Only one third of the head sat on the white cloth , but with the way Scaffold ’s architecture had impaled his head , this was one of only two segments we had that possessed its sight and hearing .
There was so much hair attached to this segment of head .   
It would only be shoulder - length if everything were back the way it should be , but with this part of the head being so small , it seemed like a lot .
My question was answered with two belated blinks .
“ You did n’t see their faces .   
Did they touch you when they used their power ?
”
Three blinks .
“
Unsure ?   
Alright .
”   
It would have been so useful to know if the power had involved touch .
“
Why were you out here ?
”
Crystal asked , jumping in .   
“
Did they invite you ?
”
“ Hold on , ” I said .
“
Sure , ” she said .
“ Nailfarer .   
Daiyu .   
I asked these questions before and I ’m going to ask again .   
Do you want to keep going ?
”
Blink .   
Yes .
“ Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable ?
”
Another ‘ yes’ blink .
“
Alphabet ?
” I asked .   
I swiped my phone , showing her the crude drawing- A - L on one side and M - Z on the other .
Blink , and after a moment ’s delay , a movement of the eye , looking off to the left of the phone .
Without turning it around
I swiped the phone left .   
A - F and G - L.   
Again , a look to her left , my right .   
A - F. “ A , B , C- alright .
”   
I repeated the process , ignoring the commotion as people came into the tent .   
“ M , N , O- .   
‘ Co’ .    
G - H - I - J - K - L- .   
Cold ?
”
Blink .
“
They set up heat lamps here , we ’re getting you warmed up as best
we can .   
After this you ’ll be moved to a hospital and you ’ll be warmer-
”
Two blinks .   
‘ No’ .
“
You want the cold , ” I said .
Blink .
“
It might help if it numbs things , ” Crystal said .
As I turned to look at Crystal , horrified , I almost missed seeing it .   
I turned back to Nailfarer .   
“
Again ?
”
A blink .   
Confirmation .
“ One of us should go talk to someone in charge , then .   
It might be the same for Scaffold and Slingstone .   
Do you need a break ?
”
I shook my head .
“
I ’ll be right back , ” Crystal said .   
She flew to her feet instead of climbing to them .
I took a deep breath , before meeting Nailfarer ’s eye .   
“
Do you want your head chilled too ?
”
Two blinks .   
No .   
Then there was a pause .   
Three blinks followed .
“
After ?
” I guessed .
One blink , slower than the ones before .
“
After , then .   
We ’ll keep that eye of yours mobile and get the information to get these guys ?
”
The blink was firm , followed by eye contact as steady as anything she ’d managed up to this point .
Outside , there was still a lot of commotion .   
Many of the body parts had been found but not identified .   
I was pretty sure that was what Slingstone was doing .
“
Anything else you need ?
”
I asked , putting my hand to the left , then I extended my right hand off to the side , “ Or back to the questions ?
”
Questions .
“ We can stop at any time .   
Four blinks , I ’ll know you ’ve hit your limit .   
Anything you can provide is useful , but if you need to back out , you do n’t need to worry .    
We have a tinker device we can try using .
”
Two blinks for no .
“
Do you have something to volunteer ?
” I asked .   
I still did n’t recognize my own voice .   
I was trying to sound gentle , but I worried I sounded like someone on the cusp of screaming or crying instead .   
I extended the other hand .   
“
Or should I ask my questions ?
”
My questions .
“
I ’d like to rattle off some possibilities , is that okay ?
”
One blink for yes .
“
You were out here when they attacked .   
Did they bait you ?
”
Yes .
“
Did they call ?   
Email ?   
Leave a message ?   
Message .   
Through a messenger or courier ?   
Paper ?   
Electronic .   
Electronic , alright .   
You had a website , I think , was it through that ?   
Another website ?   
Yes , okay .   
Parahumans Online ?
”
A message asking to meet with them , through Parahumans Online , baiting them here , where they were ambushed and taken apart , left alive and suffering .
I verified the information I had thus far , recapping it for her .   
One blink for yes .
Information confirmed by our witness , I sent a message to all cape teams in our network , warning them to be careful of anything similar .   
I added further instructions to warn any independent heroes they knew .
I left out the particulars of what had happened to the Navigators .
“
The bait , was it anonymous ?   
A guest account ?   
Alright .   
Were they posing as a fellow hero ?   
A person in need ?   
A villain ?   
Someone with information ?
”
One blink to confirm on ‘ information’ .
“
Was it information on your enemies ?   
Allies ?   
The city ?   
Other Earths ?
” I asked .   
Nothing .   
“
Do you want to spell it out ?
”
One blink , then three .   
I got my phone out and set it back to the starting image in the gallery .   
“
Tell me what you need to say .
”
C.    O …
“ Cold ?
”
A yes .   
I could see it in her eye , how it were more active , but there was a wildness to it .   
Distracted .
“
It ’s getting worse ?   
The pain ?
”
A yes - blink .
“
I ’ll be right back , ” I said .   
I headed to the opening of the tent and flagged down a doctor .
The woman came inside .   
She looked spooked .   
Justifiably .
“
Did Laserdream talk to you ?
”
“
She ’s talking to other doctors .
”
“
Nailfarer wants the heaters turned off-
we ’ll leave the one on by her head .   
She ’s anxious about it .
”
“ The cold- ” “ Is n’t hurting her .   
I do n’t think the individual parts can even be truly damaged at this point .   
But it ’s uncomfortable , and she would prefer to be numb .   
I get the impression drugs are n’t helping- ”
The doctor shook her head .   
“ Localized to certain parts , as far as we can tell .
”
“
Can we ?
”
I asked , indicating the heaters .
In the end , the answer was a ‘ no’ , but it was n’t a fearful or malicious no .   
They were wanting to load up the three victims and get them somewhere safe .   
I made my arguments , and after the doctors consulted , they settled on using a collection of ice boxes .
As the ice boxes were used , I could see Nailfarer ’s eye and the area around it shift and change , her face reacting in small ways .   
When we ’d found them , they had been paralyzed by the cold .   
That was only part of it , however .   
The parts that had been thawed could move , think more clearly , and felt the connections to the other parts elsewhere , but they did n’t always have the necessary parts .   
Nailfarer did n’t have every muscle and nerve that would communicate to parts around her damaged tissue .
“ Keep the head and the right hand out of the coolers , ” one doctor said – not one I ’d been communicating with .
“
She ’d prefer to have her hand in the cooler
, I ’m pretty sure , ” I said .
“ I want her to be able to signal and gesture to communicate .   
The hand has some limited mobility .   
If she needs something she can raise her hand .
”
“ I have a communication system , I can stay with her and interpret- ”
“
Just keep it out of the cooler , ” the doctor said , brusque .   
“
Excuse me .
” I nodded , getting out of his way .
I looked around .   
I saw Vista , standing off to one side , stoic .   
Crystal was talking to the woman in charge and some doctors .   
Golem and Cuff were with Slingshot .
The atmosphere was heavy .   
It was an entirely separate and distinct feeling from the claustrophobic feeling that had settled in over the course of the last-
I checked my phone .
-the last thirty - five minutes .   
It had only been thirty - five minutes ?
“
Are you comfortable enough ?
”
I asked Nailfarer .
Three blinks .
“ Not with the situation being what it is , obviously .   
But is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable ?
”
Two blinks .
“
Just let me know , ” I said .   
“
I ’m staying close .
”
The fingers moved clumsily- not like a hand should .   
One finger tapped hard against the metal pan it had been laid down on .
One tap equivalent to one blink ?
Crystal wrapped up her conversation , with Golem , Cuff , and Vista in the general orbit of that meeting of paramedics and police .   
The policewoman in charge was still organizing the grid - like search of the field and the area around the tree .
“
Hey cuz , ” Crystal said , sounding very tired .   
Not just fatigue-
she was heartsick .   
“
We should look at getting you home .
”
“
I ’m going to stay with Nailfarer , ” I said .   
“
I think we worked out our communication system pretty well .
”
One sharp tap on the metal pan .   
Cuff jumped .
“
Yeah .   
Pretty well , ” I said , my heart breaking a little .
“
This is n’t good for you , ” Crystal said .
“ Does n’t matter .   
They need someone to be their advocate .   
Slingstone and Scaffold ca n’t talk ?
”
“
Not much , ” Vista said .   
“ Scaffold
’s head is a mess , but he ’s still alive somehow .   
Slingstone broke down .   
They tried to put him under and it seems to have worked .
”
“
Then I ’m going to stay with these guys , see them to the hospital .   
I ’ll make sure they do n’t need anything .
”
“ I can do that , ” Crystal said .   
“
I know how your communication system works .   
I did it
with-
I ’ve done it before .
”
I saw her glance at Vista .   
Vista had some idea .   
Golem and Cuff- not so much .
“ You did it with me .   
Yeah , I know .
”
“ Trust me ?   
Let me help .
”
“
You ’re freezing , you just came back from a classified misson , and my dad is expecting you at your apartment .
”
“
I ’ll warm up at the hospital , your dad is in the top one percent when it comes to understanding ‘ we had a hero thing’ as an excuse , and I might have just come back from a warzone-
”
Golem cleared his throat .
“ You did n’t hear that .
”
I shook my head .
“ …
But a classified mission is one thing .   
You just picked fights with Teacher , Goddess , and Lung .
”
“
Holy shit .   
Lung ?
” Vista asked .
“
Wow , ” Golem said .
“ And Goddess !
”
Crystal said , wheeling on them .   
“ And a guy who was in the Birdcage for very good reasons , who is now at the top of his game !   
Major people .
”
“ Lung is major , ” Golem said , defensive .
“ Lung was major in our city !   
These people are major on multiple inhabited worlds !
”
“
I did n’t fight Goddess or Teacher directly , ” I said .
Crystal reached out and gripped me by the front of my coat , only a few inches away from having her hands around my neck .
“ If you forced me to go home , I would n’t sleep a wink anyway , ” I said , raising my eyes from her hands to make eye contact .   
My voice had that harrowed quality to it again .   
Robotic , more emotionally dead and hollow than emotional .   
“
I need to make sure they ’re okay .   
Go home .   
See dad , sleep .   
Relieve me in the morning , swing by and take over .
”
“
Then you sleep , ” she said .
“
Yes .   
Then I get my team together , and we work on figuring this out .
”
“ You do n’t have to get involved with it , Victoria , ” she said .
“ I ca n’t imagine a world where I ’m not , ” I answered .
Crystal folded her arms .   
I folded mine , staring her down .
“
There ’s something else .   
A complication .
”
“ I ’ll need to find out eventually .
”
“ I would rather it was after you ’d slept , digest what ’s already happened .   
Or better yet , walk away from this .
” I did n’t budge , staring her down .
“
There were still pieces of Nailfarer missing , were n’t there ?
”
Vista asked .
I set my jaw and nodded .
“ They were seeing if they could find all the relevant pieces , put the people back together like a jigsaw , ” Vista added .   
“ All three are still missing parts from the midsection .   
Heart , one or both lungs , ribs , other vitals .   
Slingstone could n’t deal with it .
”
“ They took parts , so we ca n’t put them back together , ” I concluded .
Vista nodded , her face grim , lips pressed together so hard they were white .
“
Good to know , ” I said .   
“ Complete and utter monsters , but … it fills out the picture .
”
“ You could n’t sound less honest if you tried , ” Crystal said , stabbing a finger at my chest .   
“ Filling out the picture .   
Do n’t pretend you ’re objective about all of this .
”
I looked away from her , and I saw her huff , annoyed .    
I asked the others .   
“
You guys are going home then ?
”
“
It was really nice to catch up some , ” Vista said .   
“
I ’m
sorry
it ’s always sandwiched between horrible stuff .
”
“
We ’ll meet up , do something easy .
”
“
Yeah , please .   
And take care of yourself , big V , please ?   
If your cousin is worried then I ’m worried .
”
“
We grew up in Brockton Bay , ” Golem said .   
“
We can make it through this .
”
I shook his offered hand .   
I did appreciate the support .
Crazy to think he was Kaiser ’s kid .
“
…
Even if it is fucking horrific , ” he added .
“
It is , ” I said .   
I was n’t sure I trusted myself to say more , in case I got emotional .
I shook Cuff ’s hand as well .
“
Keep us updated , ” she said , before she let go .   
“
This is going to haunt me .
”
I squeezed her gauntlet in confirmation .
Vista began shaping the environment , pausing only to fix the cop car that had n’t entirely receded to its original shape .   
A shortcut back to their area of the city .
The doctor got out of the back as I got near .   
She headed straight off to the other ambulances .   
Slingstone and Scaffold .
I entered the ambulance , and I sat beside the fold - out tray with the various pieces of Nailfarer
’s head on it .   
The arm was on a metal tray , which in turn was on a non - slip material , which rested on the coolers .
“ Whatever you need , Daiyu , ”
I told her , my voice low .   
“
Let me know .   
I ’m going with you to the hospital , and I ’ll be with you for a while after .   
I ’m your advocate and your hands until we get something better in place for all three of you
…
If that ’s okay .
”
One blink to confirm .
“
Can I touch your hand ?
” I asked , indicating with one hand , reaching , I stuck my other hand out the other way .   
“ Or not ?   
I do n’t want to thaw you out any faster , if that makes it hurt .
”
Her eye moved in the direction of ‘ touch’ .
It was like picking up a mannequin ’s hand .   
Cold , detached , strangely light .   
I held her hand in mine , and felt it move , holding firm .
Three blinks to ask a question .   
I used my left hand to fumble for my phone .   
A little clumsier .   
We worked through the alphabet , but it was quick with so many letters being at the start of lists .
T - E - A - M. “ Scaffold is insensate , I think .   
They put Slingstone under for a while .   
I think they would do the same for you if they thought they could .
” Blink blink .   
‘ No’ .
“ You do n’t want to .   
You want to answer questions ?
”
Blink .
Such a fucking tough cookie .   
A paramedic came to the back of the ambulance .   
He paused as he saw me .
“ You ’re coming ?
” I nodded .
“
You know her ?
”
“ Getting to .
”
The hand moved .   
I held the wrist instead of the fingers , and held the hand up so the fingers would n’t be scraping and bumping againg the surface .   
The hand was heavier than the length of arm it was attached to .
She shook so much- with effort , with stress , and probably with emotion .
One thumb partially extended , fingers drawn most of the way in .
“
Good enough , ” the paramedic said .
Someone else got in- another paramedic , while the guy who ’d been at the back headed to the driver ’s seat .
The guy sitting by Nailfarer seemed at a loss for what to do for her .   
He busied himself making sure the coolers were secure .
“
Where were we ?
” I asked .   
The emotions I ’d been repressing were getting to me , and my eyes were welling up .   
It was either cry , or find myself in panic mode .   
I did n’t fight the crying , instead focusing on my phone .   
“
By my notes , we left off while talking about what they used to bait you out .
”
Blink .
Hard to breathe .
I blinked , and tears streaked down my cheek .   
I turned to one side , holding up the phone at Nailfarer ’s eye level .   
Daiyu ’s eye level .   
It put the paramedic behind me , able to see the screen as I showed Nailfarer .   
I hoped it meant he did n’t see the tears .
If he did , he did n’t say anything .
⊙ I was quiet as I let myself in .   
The place was dark , but light was just beginning to stream in .
Ashley and Damsel had fallen asleep in the living room .   
There were two wine glasses on the coffee table , a bottle of red wine , as well as a cutting board with a quarter of a baguette , some assorted meats and cheeses , and a number of vegetables – not terribly exotic , but supply lines and international farming was n’t what it had been on Bet .   
They had n’t finished the vegetables , bread or meat , but there was a plate I was fairly sure had been set with chocolates .
Damsel had fallen asleep with her head in Ashley ’s lap .   
Ashley had pulled four or so throw - blankets over herself , trying to stay warmer , and slumped over to the side , head leaning on the arm - rest of the couch , feet pulled up and pressed into Damsel ’s belly .   
Clawed fingers draped off the side of the couch , curling up as much as they were able as they pressed against the floor .
The food had been sitting out for a while , but I did n’t really care .   
I ’d managed to keep my stomach for the worst of the evening , I ’d endure whatever food poisoning gave me .   
I hoped .
The baguette was a little stale , the cheeses tacky with the moisture that had leeched out .   
The meat had a crispy quality at some of the edges , when it had n’t been cooked .
I took what I could .   
I thought I had n’t made noise , but as I straightened , Ashley had her eyes open .   
She had n’t moved the rest of her an inch .
“ How bad ?
” she asked .
“ As bad as it gets without being S - class .
”
“ Endbringer class ?
”
“
Basically .
”
“
You did n’t call us out .
”
“
Not that kind of bad .   
I ’ll explain tomorrow , best as I can .   
For now , we keep our mouths shut .
”
“
Why ? ”
Ashley asked .
Damsel had her eyes open now too .   
She did n’t move either .
“
Too dangerous .   
It ’s the kind of thing that blows up .   
It has to wait until we have more information .
”
“ Nothing ’s going to happen in the meantime ?
”
“ I warned people to be wary .   
All hero teams should be standing down , villains are holding off until a meeting tonight .
”
“ Then we have to do something before then .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“
I ’m thinking I get three or four hours of sleep , then we wrangle the heroes .   
Organize something , see what info we can dig up .
”
“
Then we annihilate them , ” Damsel said , half asleep .    
The blanket that Damsel had put over her legs was pricked with a blade - point , then moved so it covered her head , as she turned her face away from the window , still using Ashley ’s thigh as a pillow .
“
No annihilation yet , ” Ashley replied .
“ If you get around to it and you do n’t send me an invitation , I ’ll have to annihilate you instead .
”
“ Naturally , ” Ashley said .   
She put her head back and sighed in a way that looked like she was trying to get back to a place where she could fall asleep again .
I made my exit .   
Back to my room , grabbing my bag and then simultaneously trying to juggle food and bag all at once .   
Finding it too much , I checked nobody was looking , then altered my body ’s orientation to be horizontal , placing the things across my belly and lap .   
I swam - floated in the direction of my room and got myself set up there .
Computer , food , water .   
I tore off a hunk of baguette with my teeth and ate it on its own .   
Wood smoked , and flavorful enough that it was actually fine and enjoyable like that , even stale .   
I booted up my computer .
The staler end of the baguette eaten and chewed , I tore off pieces and combined them with cheese and meat from my plate .
A message from the Wardens .   
I ’d sent something from the hospital , asking for details on the bait - message that had gone out to the Navigators .
My reply came from Dragon .
Finding the internet address the message had been sent through was n’t the hardest thing in the world , though obfuscation had been used .   
Dragon could do that .
But while she and I were talking , she wrote , she had two subjects she wanted to raise .   
One was Jeanne Wynn ’s pledge to me , that she would get me access to the files .   
Dragon was her intermediary in that .
She was less keen to provide details on the other .   
It was something that Dragon felt could only be discussed face to face .
⊙ The information .   
Spell it out .   
Trust .
Vista and Golem were in attendance along with Cinereal-
and I was n’t sure if that was a good thing or a bad one .   
On any other day , objective , I would have said she was the perfect person for the role .   
She was serious , focused , and she had an angry edge to her , but always controlled .   
Controlled anger was , in my opinion , perfect for the current crisis .   
She had been a heavy hitter in Atlanta , which hosted a major arm of Watchdog , unusual in that she did n’t tend to leave her city , even for Endbringer fights , because her power was best if she stuck to one location .
But Cinereal was scary as shit .   
She was almost scarier than Alexandria in pure attitude and disposition , and Alexandria had been the Protectorate ’s enforcer , their scary woman in black and steel .   
Cinereal had no steel and wore ash grey and white .   
She had no spikes and no hard edges , no weapons in plain view .   
It was the look on her face , upper half covered with a mask , and it was in how she held herself .
I could imagine all of the angriest , most fucked up corporate capes and Wards
I ’d run into over the course of my adolescence .   
The kids who ’d been angry and frustrated , got powers , joined a team , and got worse , not better .   
I knew that they got second chances , they were coddled to , and inordinate resources were spent on them .
Seeing the natural resting bitch face , the posture , and the natural menace , I was pretty sure that Cinereal was one of the PRT ’s success stories , when it came to transforming the tougher Wards into good heroes .   
She ’d never been meant to be a leader , much less of a major city like Atlanta , but her predecessors had died , she ’d taken up the position by order of succession in a crisis , and I imagined nobody had been brave enough to ask her to leave the role , after .   
To her credit , she ’d never given them a reason .
Still , it was distracting that I felt so on guard against her .   
She was as bad as Ashley when Ashley was touchy , but she did n’t rant .
I ’d asked Vista to come and to corroborate , and to be our liaisons to the Wardens .   
All of the other hero team leaders were here .   
Brio from Foresight , Mayday from Advance Guard , and Moonsong from the Shepherds .
Smaller team leaders were present too .   
Houndstooth , Recycler , Danger Ranger , Withdrawal and Caryatid , Lark and Dido , Cacophobic , and Sweet Justice were gathered .   
Some had sat out .   
I was glad that Super Magic Dream Parade had .
I had Swansong and Capricorn with me .   
Capricorn sat while I stood , one of his hands casually resting on the laptop keyboard .   
We were connected to Lookout .
It took a while for everyone to get settled .
“
This should n’t leave this room until we ’re all in agreement , ” I said .   
“
I talked to the police deputy on the scene , and she thought it was sensible to be careful on this one .
”
“
The Navigators got hurt , ” Mayday said .
I nodded .
“
It was bad ,
” Danger Ranger said .
He was with the Wayfarers , and the Wayfarers were loosely connected to the Navigators .   
They ’d worked together on major missions , but Ranger and his team were usually okay to play things much more ‘ street level’ than gunning for America - side groups of international gangs .   
Nailfarer had wanted to reach out to him once things were settled .   
Before she ’d managed to fall asleep .
“
Twelve hours ago , ” I explained , “ The Navigators were sent a message on Parahumans Online .   
It was very targeted , telling them that there was a group of families that had been captured and held on a tinker vessel .   
They ’d escaped on Gold Morning and were looking to reconnect with their families .   
For those of you who know the Navigators , this is like offering a million dollars to mercenaries or an international shipment of someone else
’s supply to a drug lord .   
It ’s what they ’re about .
”
There were some nods .   
Most knew this .   
Withdrawal was sitting in a chair , his agility frame folded up , under    and around the chair so it had some spring to it , adjustable on the fly .   
A notebook was pressed against his knee and he took notes as I talked .
“
They used knowledge about the team to bait them , and when they attacked the Navigators , they hit hard .   
All three members are in the hospital and we do n’t know if they ’ll recover .
”
All faces in the room were deadly serious .   
Cinereal , already and always serious , drummed her fingers .
Swansong spoke up , “ This was either personal or it was meant to provoke .   
The reason Antares is urging caution is that we ca n’t be baited by the provocation , and we ca n’t let emotions cloud our search for the personal .
”
“
Exactly , ” I said .
“
What did they do ?
” Mayday asked .
“ They were taken to pieces , ” I said .   
“ Cut , torn , dismembered , fingers removed , teeth scattered .   
A power was used to preserve them before it happened .   
They ’re aware and feel every piece
, they are n’t succumbing to exposure , sickness , or blood loss .
”
“ They were made immortal and chopped up ?
”
Moonsong asked , her eyes wide behind her mask .
“ Chopping would have been tidy , ” Swansong said .   
“ Pieces were torn off .
”
“
I ’ve talked to Slingstone and Nailfarer , ” I said .   
“
They both said that they were attacked by multiple individuals .   
They were hit hard enough and fast enough that by the time the power use came into play , they were n’t able to discern any particulars .   
One attacker was large , with a frame like a bear , either Changer , minion , drone , or Case-53 .   
Another was more precise .
”
I hit keys on the keyboard , showing images that the cops had taken , as well as a few that Crystal had spotted with her keen eyesight .   
It started with the footprints , the shovel , streaks of blood to show how far the spray had traveled , and gradually got to the full show- pictures taken of the gore .
“
Dragon identified the source of two messages that went out last night , ” I said .   
“
The first was to the Navigators .   
The second to Super Magic Dream Parade , shortly after .
”
“
They ’re absent , ” Cinereal noted .   
“
Are they scared ?
”
“
They ’re fearless , ” Lark said .
“
They ’re staying in a secure location .   
They apparently do n’t check Parahumans Online often .   
They found both the warning email and the message on PHO this morning , on waking up , ” I explained .   
“
The bait was a query about a magazine shoot .
”
“ The first issue of the revitalized Nippon Dirge , ” Tristan noted .
I nodded .   
“
Both came from a library terminal in Boston .   
They bounced the connection across the city , using a non - tinker hack , and by the time we traced it back to the original source , they had cleared security cameras and other footage from nearby locations .   
We could n’t look back and try to trace their steps or search out anything weird .
”
“
It ’s possible they have some connection to government , or to part of the city ’s infrastructure , ” Tristan said .   
“
They knew the servers they were working with , the library , the library terminals , and they came prepared .   
Dragon said she did n’t see any signs of attempted and failed intrusion that had the same signatures or style .   
Either they jumped from amateur hour to professional or they got it
right the first time .   
Getting it right the first time requires powers or foreknowledge and familiarity .
”
“
You ’re ignoring the obvious clue , ” Moonsong said .
“
The power they used ?
” I asked .
“ How many powers are there that fit that crime scene , with the victims left alive ?
” she challenged .
“
The Graeae Twins , under March .   
Bitter Pill is a theoretical possibility .   
Bonesaw would be a possibility .
”
“
Your sister , ” Lark said .   
“
Sorry to bring it up , but if we ’re covering all the bases …
”
“
She ’s being monitored carefully , ” Cinereal said .   
“
For now she ’s playing nice and organizing a balance with Shin ’s governments , to get food to Gimel to help us get through the winter .   
For now .
”
“ She can manipulate biology .   
She could create a body double with identical DNA to her , ” Lark said .
“
She could make something close , but not identical , ” I said .   
In trying to sound controlled I might have sounded pissed .   
I tried to dial it back , explaining , “ Manton rule .   
If she gave something her own DNA or something close enough to it , she would n’t be able to affect what she was creating .
”
“
My point stands , ” Lark said .   
“
She could create something that looks like her and then slip through .
”
Swansong snorted .   
Her tone was all venom as she told him , “ She could make pigs fly , but I ’m not going to start carrying an umbrella yet .   
Baseless speculation does n’t get us anywhere .
”
“ Conceded , ” Lark said , folding one leg over the other , placing his hands together on one knee .   
He wore a heavier suit than he had for our last meeting , but the expense of it was clear in how neat the creases were .   
His open - book - slash - bird mask with the bookspine beak dipped .
“
We ’re sure we have an eye on her , ” Cinereal said .
Had she said it like she was saying it to me ?   
Huh .
“
Thank you , ” I said .
“
There ’s one more possibility , ” Tristan said .   
“
But I do n’t think it narrows anything down .   
The power fits perfectly for what we ’re dealing with .
”
“
Who ?
”
Danger Ranger asked .
“ Barcode , ” Tristan said .   
“
They have someone who can take you to pieces without risking death .
”
“
That sounds pretty fucking narrowed down to me , ” Danger Ranger said .   
“
You did n’t bring this up before ?
”
“
They ’re mercenaries , ” Tristan said .   
“ If we want to figure out their reasoning , it starts and stops with the money .   
We ’d have to get them , then get them to tell us who hired them , and they do n’t do that .   
They set up contingencies .
”
“ Barcode , March ’s
Graeae twins , or … ”
“ Tinkers , ” I said .
“ Broad , ” she said .
“ Tinkers are the most complicated factor , in narrowing down who we ’re after .   
Even if we recognize a power , we have to remember that tinkers can scan a parahuman power and adapt their tech to replicate or use an aspect of that power .   
They can share gear or steal ideas , which can functionally be like scanning .   
We have to be careful , second guess ourselves .   
‘ A tinker emulated it’ is just one possibility .
”
“
It sounds like you ’re walking back what you said when you wanted to get everyone on board , ” Houndstooth said .
“
Which part ?
” I asked .
“ Being strong , ” Houndstooth said .   
“
Doing this in a decisive , organized way .
”
“ You talked about disappearing capes , ” Moonsong added her voice to things .
I could n’t deny it .   
“ I did .   
Both things may be necessary .   
Strength and having a way to eliminate the worst offenders from the equation .
”
“ Now you ’re quibbling .   
We ca n’t ever be sure because it might be a tinker , or it might be …
what ?
”
“ Frame job , ” Swansong said .
Moonsong shook her head .   
“
Not good enough .   
You said you wanted to limiting this serious step to dealing with the worst of the worst .
”
“
Yes , ” I said .   
“
And we should .
”
“
Except this looks like the worst to me , and it feels like we ’re getting a little wobbly when it comes to the follow - through .   
Making excuses before we even start hunting them .
”
“ If this is provocative , we ca n’t snap up the bait .   
If this is personal and done this smart at the same time , then we have to be smarter and cooler - headed .
”
“ They took some of our own to pieces , ” Mayday said .   
“
I ’ve seen teammates die .   
I ’ve seen what happens when heroes are n’t firm enough .   
We just set them running with our first day of organized hero work .   
They ’re running to the same places .
”
“ They are meeting tonight .   
But if we come to a decision and coordinate in a calm , effective way , we can get out ahead of whatever they decide to do , ” I said .
“
The prisoner ’s dilemma , ” Brio said .   
“ Is n’t it ?   
If we play a soft hand and the villains go hard , more of us are going to end up like the Navigators .   
If we go hard and the villains play soft- ”
“ We ’ve dealt with the problem , ” Mayday cut in .
“ We ’ve eliminated the wrong people , ” Brio said .   
“
I ’d rather end up like the Navigators than send an innocent man to … wherever we ’re disposing of the worst people .
”
“
Thank you , ” I said .
“
You did n’t see how they were , ” Danger Ranger said .   
“
How bad it was .
”
“
We investigate this thoroughly , ” Brio said .   
“
That ’s my vote .   
I trust my team to stand behind it .
”
For a few moments , the retorts and the people trying to speak over one another made understanding any one person impossible .   
Team captains and leaders rose from their seats .
“
Enough , ” I said .
The word was n’t enough .   
It did stop some people , but those people were more on Breakthrough ’s side than on the other one .   
More respectful than angry .
The overlapping voices continued for a second , until the people deferred , allowing one voice to take the lead .
“ Investigations are about time , ” Mayday said .
“ We have a time camera .   
We have thinkers .   
We ’re flexible .
”
“ We go after possible suspects , we put the word on the street , ” Mayday said .   
“
We round them up and take action to discourage and scare them before the villains meet and decide that they want to protect and encourage the lunatics who did this .
”
“
Please tell me that there ’s a thinker in the room who can tell us decisively that this is a bad idea ,
” I said .
There was n’t .
“
Speaking for Advance Guard , we ’re on your team .   
We ’re still willing to be on the network and make it work , if you ’ll have us .   
The only point of contention here is this particular point of policy , ” Mayday said .   
“
I ’ve seen too many of my Wards and Protectorate capes suffer and die .   
I ca n’t abide by it any more .   
Not a good team like the Navigators .
”
“ Give us six hours to gather information and figure out where we stand , ” I said .   
“ Make the villain meeting the deadline .   
Sweep up the possible culprits while they ’re on their way in .
”
“ We ’ll have this done in six hours , ” he said .
Moonsong was with him .   
Maybe the only time the Shepherds and Advance Guard had ended up on the same page .   
A part of me wondered if she ’d be taking the opposite tack if Tristan were on the other side of the argument .
Kings of the Hill .   
Too closely linked to Mayday , they were friends and they were of like mind .
And of course the Wayfarers .   
Friends of the Navigators .   
This was both personal and emotional .
All rose and prepared to go , ready to begin the hunt .
“
Mayday , ” I said .
He stopped .
“
We ’ll keep you in network , but you have to keep the details about the Navigators secret .   
If it gets out , it might encourage others .   
It ’ll scare the public , it ’ll disturb the peace , and it ’ll cloud any investigation we do .
”
He only gave us a nod .
When those teams left , Foresight , the Wardens , and the miscellaneous minor teams like the Major Malfunctions remained .
“ We have to be neutral in this , ” Vista said .
“
We ’ll see , ” Cinereal said .   
“
I ’d rather both approaches get all the support they can .
” I nodded .
“
Only way we course correct here is if we get out ahead of it .   
We investigate before they disappear someone undeserving in their own way , ” Tristan said .   
“
Yeah ?
”
I drew in a deep breath and sighed .   
I conceded , “ Yeah . ”








My boots hit the snow - dusted ground .   
With the impact , I made the transition from being weightless and able to move myself in any direction at will to feeling gravity assert itself on me once more .   
I felt another weight , the kind one referred to when they spoke of heavy hearts , burdens , and social pressure .
Eight hours of intermittent snowfall had n’t covered up all of the blood .
The fact that the ground was hard and had ice here and there made the footfalls seem that much heavier .   
Ice crunched and I could imagine boots coming down to crack stone .   
Even dirt , which should have absorbed impacts , allowed for audible footfalls in the relative silence .   
The only noise came from the wind and the light midday traffic , on a road that would take three or four minutes to walk to .
Foresight had sent four of their ten members to us .   
It might not have sounded like much , but they were good .
Brio had his standard look going , pirate and ninja combined , without any of the explicit signifiers of either , all with gold veins running through it .   
He was all presence , loping swagger , and casual competence .   
I ’d seen him before in coat , eyepatch , and far too many belts , and seeing him now I realized that he ’d been dressed casual then .   
He had more belts , including some strapped to his leg and arm , and every one of them had a use , keeping a small arsenal in place .   
His right hand and forearm were through the bars of a steel riot shield with a viewport like a Foresight logo , and his left hand rested on two weapons- index fingers extend out at the base of a gun , and the heel of his hand at a sword .   
His side of the riot shield had a decorated sawed - off shotgun fixed to it , pointed at the ground , and some ammunition strapped in .
Crystalclear was keeping Relay company .   
Crystalclear had updated his costume , and it looked good-
the black of it made the quartz - like crystals that jutted from him look that much more distinct .   
The crystal growth was more exaggerated than before , but I was assuming the simplest explanation – that the crystal was better than skin and scalp being exposed to the cold .
Relay , meanwhile , was wearing a more ‘ cloth’ costume , the long sleeves mostly separate from the body , a series of overlapping folds extending down his body to the ankles .   
There were a lot of gaps in the cloth , and through those gaps I could see the sheen of metal , form - fitting enough to be chainmail .   
Single spikes were visible here and there , when he moved in the right way- one at the gap where the sleeves would have met the shoulder , another at the blindfold , extending up the forehead , and another at the wrist , like a blade hidden up his sleeve .   
He was the ‘ rescue’ combo - teleporter and long - distance communicator .
As they got closer to the scene , walking over from the road , Relay hung back , breaking away and ending the conversation with Crystalclear .
I expected Crystalclear to join Anelace , since the two had to be closer in age , but Crystalclear headed straight to Brio .
The stragglers were taking longer .   
They were less of a ‘ march forward’ bunch .   
Recycler and his teammate Retouch were talking to the Major Malfunctions , and Fume Hood was tolerating a conversation with Sweet Justice .
I could have gone to that group , checked that they were okay , touched base , warned them about the details they might see .   
Especially with Finale in the group , it might have been warranted .   
At the same time , her teammates were with her , and I could n’t see a good angle to approach and join the conversation without outright barging in .
That , and I was n’t sure I had it in me to manage too much more .   
Having the heroes split over what to do had taken a bit out of me , as had the late night at the hospital .   
I needed a breather .
I ’ll warn Finale before they see anything bad .
What are the odds that any those heroes who acted outraged over the treatment of the Navigators even visited the victims or the crime scene ?   
Wayfarers excepted .
I felt petty and annoyed , and I was n’t sure I trusted myself around the wide - eyed heroes .
I walked over to Anelace , instead .   
He watched me despite wearing a mask without eyeholes
– only the white lines of an illustrated dagger on the side , the center of it marking the eye .   
His coat    was form - fitting and shorter than Brio or Relay ’s , showing just how narrow his waist was , and his costume bottoms were similarly slimming .   
A little edgy , being all black , but there was enough variation and decoration that it looked more like its own style than anything forced .
Maybe Ashley was rubbing off on me .
“
Your team
okay ?
”
Anelace asked .
They were late , and he was asking diplomatically .   
“ They had to pick up another teammate .   
Tress went to the hospital to ask some follow - up questions and get some answers from Scaffold , now that he ’s talking .   
She knows the communication forms necessary to talk to Nailfarer and Slingstone .
”
“ I got Brio to request and pull some of the crime scene and medical photos , ” Anelace said .   
“
I was curious about the weapons used and the way the damage was done .
”
“ Personal interest ?
”
I asked , my eyebrow raised .
“
Never wanted it to be , ” he said .   
“
But powers do n’t always give us what we want .
”
“ Fair , ” I said .   
I could read between those lines easily enough .   
He was a thinker , and thinkers were especially prone to being pushed into the mental states or dilemmas they were in when they triggered .   
It made me curious , but I was n’t about to push .   
Anelace had been decent to me .   
“
What did you find out ?
”
“ They traded off attacks in quick succession .   
You described it as a blitz .
”
“
Yeah .   
Surprise attack , all - in .
”
“
And the attackers swooped in .   
One hits , and before the person they hit is even finished reacting , the next hits .   
Coordinated .
”
“
That makes me think tinker or master minions .   
Or thinkers , even someone like Teacher .
”
“ Or Occam ’s razor , ” the guy with a blade theme said , “ simplest solution and everything .   
They could be a team that has spent a lot of time fighting alongside one another .
”
“
I ’m not sure on that .   
How many people are this strong , this experienced , and yet complete unknowns ?   
I feel like we know enough general details that it would click
and we ’d snap our fingers and say it ’s this team or that team .
”
“ Could be they are n’t from America .
”
“
True .   
Or Bet , ”
I said .
“ Whoever they are , they ’re coordinated but I think they might have individual personalities .   
The big guy with the claws tried to mercy kill Scaffold , maybe after the others in the group had walked away , but it did n’t work .
”
“
He did n’t like how far that went .
”
“ Seems not , ” Anelace said .
“
Good .   
Thank you .   
That little detail about the throat cut was bothering me , and this narrows things down .   
If there ’s that kind of personality involved , it might rule out things like minions and tinker drones .
”
“ Teacher thralls ?
”
I made a so - so gesture .   
“
I think they have some personality .   
I could see this scene playing out as described .   
Either way , thank you .   
It ’s a good interpretation of things .
”
“
You ’re welcome , ” he said .
We stopped walking , or rather , he stopped before I did , because we were at the very edge of the scene now , and going further risked stepping on bloodstain .
I turned around , so I faced Anelace again .   
He was oriented with the bloody crime scene ahead of him , and I faced the distant road , as well as our straggling teams that were still heading to the site .
I saw the distant constellation of orange lights before I recognized the Kenzie van .   
A ditch lined the sides of the rural road , and the orange lights created a bridge for the car to pull off the road and drive straight onto the field .
“
I ’m less sure on this one , ” he said ,
his eyes scanning the scene .   
“
I saw some of the injuries .   
One of the attackers attacked from above .   
Blades or talons going straight down , getting caught on the flesh .   
Some weight was behind it , angle was too straight .   
I ’m really curious about that one .
”
“ Weight behind it-
a whole body ’s worth ?   
If someone flew and then came down without flight ?
”
“
No , ” Anelace said .   
“
That much weight would have pushed the cut all the way down , or pulled the victim to the ground .   
They stopped themselves , or held themselves back .
”
“
Good , ” I said .   
Did that mean high control ?   
Or very low control , flapping wings ?   
Did they not want to touch ground ?   
“
Trying to visualize that .
”
“
Ca n’t say more until I see more .   
It might mean there ’s a fifth attacker in the ambush , ” Anelace said .   
“
You counted them by footprints ?
”
“ Police did , with the heroes helping , yeah . ”
“
Yeah .   
This is bigger than the pictures suggested .
” I nodded .   
Worse in daylight .   
The darkness where the headlights did n’t shine had created a sense that the scene was smaller .   
It was possible the officers had parked on or over parts of the scene , now that I could see just how far the blood had been scattered .
“ I do n’t want to insult your teammate or your friends over there , but can these guys handle this ?   
Your tinker is a kid , is n’t she ?
”
“ I do n’t know , ” I said .   
“
She ’s the only one who can operate this camera , though .   
We talked it over , see if we ca n’t strike a balance .   
But she was insistent on doing it .   
She’s- she wants to help .   
She ’s a hero at heart .   
Even when it ’s not good for her .
”
“ All of us are insistent , ” Anelace said .   
“
And none of us would be here if we were concerned about the sacrifices involved .   
What about them ?
”
He indicated the collection of stragglers .
“ The Major Malfunctions ?
”
“ Recycler and his teammate too .   
The hooded woman-
she was from the community center attack .
”
“
Fume Hood has other experience .   
Low - level , but a good few years of regular activity .
”
“
Good to know .
”
“ Major Malfunctions … new .   
But I know two of the three can handle themselves .   
Teacher threw an army at us , and they all held their own .
”
“ Respect .
”
“ I think it was his B - listers , to be fair .   
He saved the real soldiers for the prison .
”
“ If you fought an army , take credit for fighting an army .   
Give them that credit .   
What about the eco heroes ?
”
“
Recycler and Retouch are veterans in their own way .   
I ’m less sure about them .
”
“
Why ?
” I frowned , pausing to raise a hand in greeting as the van pulled up at the very edge of the scene .   
Byron had been driving , with Swansong of all people in the passenger seat .   
Precipice , Lookout , and Sveta got out of the back , with Precipice carrying the bulky time camera .   
Byron jogged over to help , switching to Tristan , who said something .
“
I have n’t fought alongside them .   
That ’s part of it .   
The other part is that    Recycler and Retouch are from Dryad Project 3 .   
Sponsored , ” I said .
I gave Anelace a look .
“
I heard of some incidents .   
I did n’t pay much attention there , ” he admitted .   
“
Other focuses , I was new to my powers , and I did n’t have any reason to investigate some group in another state with nothing to do with me .
”
“
Nah , it ’s fine , ” I said .   
“
Most of it was covered up .   
It was a slow motion train wreck .   
It makes me wonder if I should assume they learned from the team
’s mistakes or if they ’ve become lasting casualties of them .
”
“
What kind of train wreck ?
” I sighed .   
I did n’t want to be unfair , but I did want to paint a full picture .   
“
I mean , they ’re sponsored , not corporate , so they had someone paying the bills and all they had to do was hero .   
And they were pretty good at that .   
The sponsors ?   
They started it off on the entire wrong foot .   
Way too much promotion and way
too much money pushed into a team with self - imposed mission of saving the planet .
”
“ Not a bad mission , considering how we ended up .
”
“
That ’s the issue .   
It was n’t saving the planet from Endbringers or other threats .   
It was saving us from ourselves .   
Pollution , deforestation , ecology all things that have their validity … on Earth Aleph .   
People did n’t buy it .   
And if people are n’t buying , how do the sponsors get the money they invested back ?
”
“ Bad management decisions , then .
”
“ Hired a bunch of bright , genuinely cool heroes , diverse , all good , but few of those heroes cared about the mission before they joined the team , some did n’t care after , and the ones who were really gung - ho got sidelined-
” I paused to indicate the pair .
“
Ah ha .
”
Was it unfair to stress that the two were really hyped and serious about the ‘ green’ thing , when we ’d had bigger concerns ?   
It was true , but I was n’t sure , and I had no idea if it factored into their judgment or their ability to handle situations like this .
I shrugged .   
“
The lack of care from sponsors and the hired - on heroes seemed pretty obvious to most .   
Then the team got on the wrong side of the Youth Guard , broke or toed the line of just about every damn rule in the book when it came to costumes , school , friendships , throwing kids into violent situations …
Two pairs of parents were saying they had n’t seen their kid in weeks .
”
“
That was the part I heard about .
” I smiled .   
“
Yeah .   
And the shitty thing is they had some good heroes .   
Recycler and Retouch were n’t hip in a way that worked for Dryad Project Three , but they ’re strong
, they ’re pretty capable with potential to place themselves in the public eye , and they ’re earnest , which is really important .
”
“ Those two seem to have come out of the train wreck
okay .
”
I held my tongue , because there was some stuff that I ’d heard third - hand .   
My mom had talked and had drinks with a woman from a costume company at one point a while back , not long before Leviathan .   
Tipsy , the woman had confided things that were n’t hers to share , and my mother had told me , because she ’d thought I needed to know what to watch out for .
I did n’t want to continue the chain of rumor mongering when it came to stuff that was that personal .   
The names we chose and the costumes we wore were so important .   
On her move from the bench to the main team , Retouch had been given a new look .   
Makeover , name , no more time with her boyfriend .   
She ’d been transformed from girly girl to athletic tomboy in image and told to play a role , say certain things .
At fourteen , just three months into that new position on the team and the life that came with it , she had torn out an entire fistful of her new short hairdo in the midst of a public meltdown and then retired from being a hero , indicating there was a lot more going on behind the scenes .   
Worse still , despite her voicing her retirement , she was pulled back in , mandated by contract , made to make appearances and attend events .
“ Seems so , ” I said .
“
What happened in the end ?   
Gold Morning ?
” I shook my head .   
“
Two members of the other serious or semi - serious members joined a villain eco - terrorist group .   
The team was barely staying afloat with money from sponsors , after a hundred fines from Youth Guard , court cases , more promotion and marketing , and then a reporter dropped an expose .   
The sponsor was n’t a saint in the eco thing , with cover - ups .   
The heroes were a distraction .
”
“ Everything that could go wrong went wrong , ” Anelace said .
I nodded .
The time camera was set in place .   
We ’d been outed on the time camera use when the police had come through .   
They ’d written it into reports , and a few of the team leaders read the cliff notes on any and all reports , just like some patrolling heroes listened to the police scanners .   
They ’d asked , and we ’d told , as part of the attempt to get people on board .
Anelace ’s voice interrupted me while I was in the midst of forming the thought that I should say goodbye and go warn the more innocent members of the various groups that things were about to get ugly .
“
I wish you ’d joined Foresight .
”
I raised an eyebrow .   
“ Thank you .   
Or-
I ’m not sure what to say to that .   
Came out of nowhere .
”
“ We ’re talking about teams , and I ’m seeing all these different teams .   
It ’s important .   
Who we ’re with .
”
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
“ One of the most important things .
”
“
You ’re okay with them ?
”
Swansong was guarding Lookout , ensuring she sat with her back to the scene that was slowly unfolding .   
The lines of falling snow were dominant , blocking much of the view .   
Sveta made her way over to help , and bumped shoulders with Ashley as they formed a two - person wall to block Lookout
’s view .   
They exchanged words , and they seemed at ease .
They were very , very different people , but they could talk , and they seemed to enjoy the moment .   
More than that , Sveta seemed to be in a reasonably good mood , considering the scene that was slowly being mapped out .
Tristan and Precipice were talking .   
Precipice -Rain- had transformed .   
I knew he still carried a lot .   
I was n’t of the opinion that he should be freed of that burden .   
But he was helping , he was doing good , and if he ever worked off that burden , truly worked it off , then he deserved to be free of it .
Tristan was explaining , indicating the images .   
Red peeked through cutains of streamer - like tracks that the snowflakes had made .   
People hung on his words rather than the images , and that might have been merciful .
“
I like them , ” I said .
“
Some good ones in there , ” Anelace said .
“
Are you angling at something there , Anelace ?   
It feels like you ’re talking around a subject .
”
“ Every time I say something I ’m thinking about five responses I could make before I decide on one
I ’m not entirely satisfied with .
”
“ You want to join ?
”
He shook his head .
“
Because the alternative is you ’re going to say something really nice or really awful , and you ’re working up the courage .
”
“
It ’s not too nice or too bad , Antares .   
I was talking about keeping good company , and I think my team screwed up by not taking you when you interviewed .   
Everything you said when you were talking about your strengths and your vision was on point .
”
“ Thank you .   
But your teammates were n’t wrong .   
I was n’t in a good place .
”
“
Better place now ?
” I shrugged .   
“
Much .
”
“
If you ever want company , patrolling , minor mission , surveillance-
” I turned my full focus to him , and he stopped talking .
“
Yeah , ” he said , terminating the prior thought , then before I could respond , he added , “ It ’s an open invite .   
You caught my attention when you showed up to a superhero job interview in business casual , and I ’d like to get to know that person better , whether it ’s a work relationship , friendship , or something more .
”
I drew in a breath , pausing a second to try to formulate my thoughts .
He jumped in before I could , “ No pressure .   
I know capes have hangups , I know we ’re all busy , and we ’re all still kind of mourning- ” Dean , I thought .
“ -I wo n’t be offended if you say- ” I interrupted him , “ I ’ll be offended if you do n’t let me get a word in .
”
He made an amused sound , shifting his footing .
“ Maybe , ” I said .   
“
I ’m working through stuff , and like you say , I ’m working on all of this .
”
He nodded .   
He looked very at ease , all considered .
“
Whatever I end up deciding
, I ’m flattered .   
And I think you ’re a good guy .
”
He looked away , studying the distant New Brockton and the portal that loomed above it .
“
Earlier , you said I was dancing around things , ” he said .
“ You were .
”
“ I was .   
I do n’t want to dance about this .   
It ’s heavy
and I know it might spoil the mood or fuck my chances , but there ’s never going to be a time to mention it .
”
“
You ’re not a good guy ?
” I asked .   
He was right , the mood had shifted a bit .
“
I know a bit about the Asylum .
” I winced .   
Ah .
“
My friend ended up there .   
I know ex - staff from the place , and through them I figured out some members of your team came from there .   
Lookout for a very short time , Tress for a long time , you .   
I can make an educated guess that the rest of your team came from there .
”
I shook my head .
“
No
? ”
“ Nah , ” I said .
“
I wo n’t talk about it , it ’s safe info with me , even when I have a team that likes to pry .   
But I did n’t want to hold onto it and not let you know I knew .
”
“
How ’s your friend now ?
” I asked .
“
Gone .   
Long gone .   
Which is a mercy .
”
“
Sorry , ” I said .
“
Open invite , ” he said .   
“
No pressure .   
I should go look after my team .
”
“
Same here , ” I said .   
I gave him a light punch in the arm .   
Arm ’s length , but physical contact .   
Safe as I could manage .
I had a lot of thoughts , but I suppressed them .   
I was n’t sure he was my type , but he was n’t a boundary pusher , except for bringing up the hospital , and I had mixed feelings about that .   
It raised my guard and it lowered walls at the same time .
All of the thoughts were cast in a weird , distorting shadow , because thinking about the hospital even in passing was putting me in a frame of mind where I could remember being the Wretch and having the recurring thought and feeling that I ’d be alone for the rest of my life .   
The default way of thinking about myself and thinking about the possibility of doing anything with anyone were all switched over to that , because it had more weight than a hundred years spent like I was living now .
Not easy and not worth thinking about for now .
Sveta was smiling a bit as I caught up to her .
“
No , ” I said , pointing at her .
“
I ca n’t tease you ?
”
“ Maybe another day , when I ’ve had more sleep .
”
“
You can tease me , ” she said .   
She smiled wider .   
“
I had a good night .   
I know you told Kenzie not to call me
and you kept me out of the loop so Weld and I could catch up .   
I have mixed feelings about
that- ” “ Me too .
”
“
-But
the good feelings in that mix are very good .
”
I gave her a hug .
“
We figured something out , ” she said .   
“
It was nice .
”
“
I know I should n’t ask , ” I said , “
But I ’m really wondering …
how ?
”
She smiled and she did n’t give me an answer .
I knew that when Kenzie was happy , she bounced .   
When Ashley was especially pleased she had small smiles
and she looked like she was queen of the world- brimming security and self worth .   
Tristan had a light in his eyes , and Byron came out of his shell .   
I ’d never seen Rain happy , though-
That was a mental joke to myself .   
I ’d seen insecurities and hangups that had tortured him for a long time just fall away .
Sveta in this moment was all of those things .
Seeing her happy made me just a tiny bit of all of those things .
I had moisture brimming in the corners of my eyes , seeing that .   
A pan-
a cure all for the creeping sentiment that had come with the mention of the Asylum .
“
Since when are you a crier ?
” she whispered .
I hugged her with one arm , tight , then shook her .   
“
I thought you were n’t going to tease me .
”
“ Not about that .   
About this ?   
Definitely .
”
“
Lookout , ” I called out .   
“ Rescue me from Sveta .   
Tell me how we ’re doing .
”
She called back with her answer , “ I ’m being asked to make this work without looking , which is dumb , and it ’s slow as anything .   
That ’s
how I ’m doing .   
How are you doing , Antares ?
”
I let go of Sveta , and she smiled as I pulled away .   
“
Tired but hopeful .   
Last time you added extra batteries to speed it up , did n’t you , Lookout ? ”
“ They ’re attached .   
But there ’s a ton of on and off snow that ’s not going straight down or down at an angle , thank you giant portal over there , and that ’s taking time to calculate and render .   
And every time the wind blows it moves snowflakes across the ground , which is all stuff I have to filter without looking at it .   
It ’s dumb .
”
“ If I could unsee what I saw last night , I would , ” I told Lookout .
“
But when I get this done , you ’re going to look , are n’t you ?
”
“
Yeah .   
Have to .
”
“ I have to look too !   
See ?   
Same ! ”
Fume Hood and Crystalclear were talking off to one side .   
Catching up , it seemed .   
Past them , I saw the trio of Malfunctions with the duo of eco heroes and Sweet Justice .   
It looked like Caryatid was still shielding Finale from the worst of it .
“ Victoriaaaaa , ” Lookout complained .
“
You ’re in a mood , huh ?
” I asked .
“
Because this !   
Because I miss my old workshop , and the living situation when I ’m out of costume is so crowded and so annoying , and nobody pays much attention to me .   
And because this !
”
She punched a button .   
A screen on the face of the box lit up , displaying a line drawn out by pixels , hot pink on an electric blue background .   
The line started normal , then doubled back , then traced a bizarre path , corkscrewing .
“ That color scheme hurts my eyes to look at , ” Swansong commented .
“
It hurts my brain to think at , ” Lookout said .   
“
That ’s a Witten particle flying around like a balloon with the end undone .   
Because life has to be hard
, right ?   
They do n’t do that .
”
“ Witten ?
” I asked .
“ Gravity particle .
”
“
Oh .   
In the past ?
”
“
Yup .
”
“ That ’s got to be Vista .
”
Lookout turned slowly , then stared up at me .
She turned back to the screen , brought her head back , and swung it at the flat face of the cube .
Swansong caught her head before it made contact .   
Her voice was low .   
“ People are watching .
”
“
It mucks everything up .   
There ’s a giant smear in the middle of it and it ’s impossible to pick things out .
”
“
Work around it ,
” Swansong said , her voice still quiet .   
“
As much as we do n’t want it to be true , others define us by how we act when we ’re at our lowest and our worst .
”
“
I ’m not
that low , ” Lookout said , typing now .   
“ I ’m frustrated .
”
“ Frustration can bring you down as easily as any other sentiment , ” Swansong said .
“ Is there anything I can do ?
” I asked .
“
Do we have any time travelers here ?
”
“
Pretty sure we do n’t , ” I answered .
“
No way to go back in time and tell Vista to not smear my crime scene recreation ?   
Why did she even do that ?
”
“ Headlights , to shed some light on the scene .
”
“
There are other ways to do that !
”
“
Voice calm , ”
Swansong said , her own voice quiet and firm .   
“
Even when angry , we restrain ourselves .
”
“
Do you , though ?   
You kind of rant sometimes , ” Lookout said .
“
When was the last time ?
” Swansong asked .
“
This morning , ” I said .   
“
You did n’t like how your clone pierced the teabag when she put it in your cup .
”
“ In her cup , ” Swansong said .   
“
She pierced the bag she was placing in her cup
and then she gave it to me while taking my cup .
”
“ Scandalous , ” Lookout said .
“
Do you know how I know it was my cup ?   
Because hers is chipped and scratched from top to bottom .   
I thought she forgot and gave her the benefit of a doubt , that cow abused that graciousness , and she did it with a smile .
”
“ You do n’t need to tell me , ” I said .   
“
I heard the entire thing while I was getting out of the shower .
”
“ I apparently need to tell you because you did n’t get the full picture .   
That weakling has died eight times and it was n’t enough to teach her any sense .
”
“
By that definition you died too ,
” Lookout said .   
She was back at work , sitting on a case , keyboard in lap , typing .   
Apparently she could hold a conversation and work at the same time .
“
No .   
Death is the province of failures .   
Between the two of us , I am doing fine , and she is the failure and eternal disappointment .   
Do you know how I know ?
”
“ You have a better fashion sense , ” I said .
“ No-   
Yes , but that is n’t the defining element .   
I know because I do not fuck up tea , and I would n’t connive to hide my shame and my failings as a parahuman being if I did .
”
“
Are things going to be okay if I step away ?
” I asked .
“
Yes , ” Lookout said .   
“
I ’m going to work around the smudge .   
Maybe we can get something from the edges .
”
“ Was n’t what I was worried about , ” I said .
“
It ’s fine , ” Swansong said .   
“
Worry about what my dear clone has coming to her .
”
“ Ooh , ” I said , mock serious .   
“
No tea ?   
Oh , no treats with the tea ?
”
“ Thin ice , ”
Swansong said , pointing a finger at me .   
“
You ’ll see who gets no treats .
”
“
I so want to sleep over sometime , ” Lookout said .
I left them to that conversation .
Brio was walking through the storm of still images .   
Here and there , he would lean into things , squinting as he got in close – not that it was much use .   
Most of the figures were especially distorted and existed in continuum .   
I stopped at the edge .
“
Technical difficulties ?
”
he asked , as he emerged .   
He looked at Relay , who was off in the distance , then at Crystalclear , who nodded .   
Anelace , without looking , raised a hand in response to some message .
“
Some difficulties .   
Sorry .   
I wanted this to be a better launching - off point .
”
“ We do n’t have much to go on , ” he said .   
“
Anything we can get .
”
“
Did Crystalclear ’s patrol of the area-
”
A distant crack interrupted me .
It took me a second to place where the sound had come from .   
There were n’t many good places to choose , with so much flat ground around us , and it was really only the road that worked .   
My first impulse was that cars had collided .   
Even that they ’d hit our parked cars , that had pulled off the road .
No .   
It was a gun .
Relay was way out in the field , and I could see the divot where the bullet had hit ground , sending dirt flying out to land on otherwise pristine snow .
I took to the air , trying to get a sense of the scene and what we were up against .
Relay teleported to where Brio had been .   
There was a moment where there was only a shimmer of light around Relay , who twisted , casting out an arm , pushing the shimmer out .   
Then Brio materialized at the head of the shimmer , fifteen feet away , bringing his shield up just in time to block another bullet .
There was a second ’s pause , and then I felt the impact as the Wretch went down .   
I flew back at an angle and down , then changed direction before touching ground .   
I skimmed the ground , hoping that the humps of snow here and there would provide me some cover .
I saw a fence up ahead , barring my way , and headed straight for it .
Who were these guys ?   
Guns , accurate fire at a distance-
my first thought was March .
The Wretch hit the fence first , and I canceled it in the moment I noticed the contact .   
My gloved hands caught the fragments out of the air .   
Slats of wood with broken ends .
I paused , a shattered plank of wood in each hand , taking one second to grasp the situation and make sure that nobody was crossing the field and attacking the more vulnerable members of the group .
Not nearly enough people were standing , and people were gathered around some of the people who had crumpled to the ground .   
Some of my guys had gotten shot .   
Allies .   
Possibly my team .
Traffic had been stopped by two vehicles that had turned sideways to block both lanes .   
Dark figures I could n’t make out were behind our cars .   
Our van .   
Using the vehicles for cover while they unloaded real munitions .
More blood on this already bloodstained field .
I took flight , straight up .   
The Wretch absorbed one shot .   
If there were others , I did n’t hear or see any sign of it .








The gunfire continued below me , and if there were any shots that passed through the air as they took aim at me , I did n’t hear them .   
There was the noise of the wind rushing through and around the Wretch , faintly different from when it was brushing my skin and touching my ears .   
A distortion , a whistle .
A plank in each hand , I raised my arms to my face , burying almost all of it in my arms , the crook of the elbows at my nose and mouth , the planks out and in line with my body .   
I let the Wretch drop as I disappeared into the cloud cover and against the wind .
Cold , and worse because it was a moist cold .
I flew in a slight circle , dipping lower until I could see the general outline of things below .   
There were tears in my eyes from the sting of the cold , but I could make out the truck , the way the cars had stopped , and the clearing by the tree with Kenzie ’s van parked by it .
I shifted my grip on the planks , and then I let them fall .   
Immediately , I flew horizontally , skimming the cloud line , still feeling the cold press in on me as if from every direction , grabbing at my body and reaching toward the bone .   
My speed , moisture , wind and cold all compounded one another , and the snow that blew around me collected and bound to the surface .
I dove .   
They came into view as I came down
, what looked to be civilians or improvised soldiers in dark clothes , with what looked like used body armor .   
Two people with masks , standing off to one side .   
Not people I recognized .
One plank fell into the ditch .   
Another struck the pavement and broke .   
The plummeting objects made heads turn , which was my intent .   
The black of my costume had collected a frosting of white that made it a little less obvious .
Anger sharpened my focus .   
I did n’t use my aura as I landed , knee and one foot on the ground , hands helping to add some spring to the impact and reduce the noise .
It was n’t enough to keep some of the people from seeing me .   
That was where the sharper focus counted .   
Two in front of me , one off to the left , two off to the right .
The lone guy to my left that had noticed me turned to his friend , who was leaning over the back of one vehicle , shooting .
My target .
Flight gave me speed and velocity that I would n’t have had while running .   
The people in the middle and at the far right of the group turned weapons on me .   
One fired and landed a hit in the moment before I threw myself at the guy on the left and put the unaware between them and myself .   
One more gunshot among many .
No
aura-
them being off balance was good , but them being blindsided was better .   
I had my choice of where to hit him , and I had to dismiss all of the training Gilpatrick had imparted .   
A strike to the back of the neck , to the temple or throat could do too much harm .
The heel of my right hand met the right corner of the jaw , where it connected to the skull , the blow timed
so my arm extended and added to the impact beyond just what my flight offered .   
With speed , timing , and a target that was turning his head , I was ninety percent of the way to connecting it the way I ’d wanted .
Ninety percent earned me a gristly feeling as my hand smashed the soft area between jaw and skull , pain in my hand and pain down my forearm with the force of the impact .
He collapsed on top of his friend , who ’d been shooting and not paying nearly enough attention to the warning .
The guy to my right reacted .   
I threw myself and my elbow at him .   
I aimed for his jaw , hit his teeth instead .   
I saw a moment of blood against grit teeth , saw him reacting by twisting his head around and reaching for a weapon shorter than the rifle he held , and hit him again   
He would n’t simply stagger in pain and retaliate , this time .
Hurting people without the benefit of a forcefield hurt .   
Every impact had its equal , opposite reaction .   
I was hitting people hard , but that energy transmitted itself into my hand , into my elbow .
The guy who I ’d hit first had fallen atop someone with a gun that was n’t a rifle-
or it was , but it was an automatic .   
I punched him in the face as I threw myself on top of him , grabbing the weapon .   
He fought me , wrestling with me over it , and I could n’t afford to take the seconds to try and win .
I pushed out with my aura , and I saw his expression change- bewilderment , not fear .   
He did n’t let go , though , and I had to turn to using the Wretch .
Just a burst of power , taking a moment of strength .   
As far as I ’d been able to tell , when I activated my forcefield , it came from me .   
It hugged me , but only for the one tenth of a second that it was in contact with my skin and costume .   
The trick was using it in the moments before it unfurled .   
One instant of strength that could lift a car or punch through sheet metal .
I tore the rifle from his hands , then gave it back to him-
one of my hands gripped the barrel , the other the stock , and I smashed the middle part into his face .
Could n’t go forward without going into the firing line .   
Could n’t go back without the same issue .   
People were turning on me , concerned with the immediate threat in their ranks .   
I saw some backing away from the line of people that had formed alongside the parked cars , trying to get a clear shot , and I saw them get shoved or pulled aside .
Two capes .   
A man and a woman , in dark costumes with utilitarian masks- hard white , covering mouth and nose , bridge of the nose , and the brow .   
Both masks outlined the eye sockets but did n’t block peripheral vision .
She had a cloth scarf wound around her head and neck , white armor built into her gloves and an otherwise black uniform with body armor .   
He had the same look , but no gloves , his hat was a simple beanie , and he had a neck warmer on .   
His body armor had shoulder pads and bracers that extended over the back of his hands , and he carried a long - handled axe , like the kind emergency workers used to chop through doors .
I did n’t want to get involved with that .   
Unable to go forward or back , unwilling to go up in case it exposed me to them , I decided to go the Manton route .   
Powers came encoded with limitations , and the most common limitation that laymen and bottom - tier cape geeks associated with the term was that powers worked on inorganic things only , or they worked on organic things only .   
The chief example of a hundred possibilities , but it was what I decided to use .
In brief : through .
I threw myself into the mob .
They would be my Manton protection .   
With another burst of strength , using the rifle ’s butt and my burned hand , I shoved at the non - cape woman in front of me so she would bowl into the people behind her , then grabbed the guy to my right and used another burst to throw him in the general direction of the two capes .   
He landed near the guy with the axe , and the cape hopped over him before the flying man could collide with his shin .   
When the cape landed , though , he did n’t have good footing that was n’t stepping on the man that had fallen , he tried to step on snow , and he slipped to his hands and knees instead .
I kept the people around me , using strength to grab them , force them to stumble , and keep them between me and the capes .   
I saw the guy getting up , while the woman was retreating , crouching low to the ground , and threw the next guy toward the masked guy .
Or I tried .   
I extended my arm in the throw , and he jerked violently .   
I saw gouges appear in his cheap , duct - taped body armor , close to the heart , and then his arm broke .   
The break got worse , twisting-
I canceled the Wretch and let him fall .
The uneasy , unsure satisfaction that came with finding a way forward had its backlash , ten times the negative for any positive I might have found in it .
He hit the ground and fell against my leg , which added to the pressure and the lack of elbow room .   
I used flight to keep myself upright , but people were pressing in , and I gave them a second ’s pause with my aura .   
It made them stop , staring , and little else .
Stop fighting me , Wretch .   
Whatever you want , we can get it by working together .   
Do n’t fuck me on the fear .   
Do n’t fucking tear people apart when I have a cape I need to stop !
The Wretch had practically torn his arm off , I could see it as   
I tried to handle stuff , and it distracted at a moment I needed my focus .
I ’d hurt someone , fuck me .   
Could n’t do this- could n’t escape without easily exposing myself .   
I ’d bought others a chance to breathe and I was n’t sure it mattered .
Someone grabbed for the assault rifle I was holding in one hand , and I drew my free hand around to use the spikes that laid across the back of my hand .   
With my hand in a fist , the spikes stuck out , and I could rake his hand .   
Just enough harm to do what I needed and free myself , no more .
In the time it took me to do that , two more people had grabbed me .
I twisted , used a burst of strength to hurl them away , and flew up , aiming to put myself over the top of the car that they ’d been using as shooting cover .
I had a glimpse of the masked woman with her hand raised .   
She made a quick beckoning gesture and something in me went .
I hit the top of the vehicle I ’d been meaning to go over .   
A second had passed , I ’d stopped flying , I ’d dropped the Wretch and I ’d let go of the gun I ’d been using as a club .
Stupid , I thought .
People grabbed me .   
I twisted away and tried to roll over the trunk of the vehicle to the far side , and I found myself as weak as a baby .
Fly .   
I forced myself to fly , and it did take some forcing .   
Not because my power was weak or gone , but because my head was n’t all there .   
My thoughts were as weak as my body .
I ’d bought some time .   
People on our side who had been pinned down by gunfire were getting closer .   
Brio , Anelace .   
I did n’t see Capricorn , Lookout , or Ashley , but I saw Rain , who was hanging back , a silver blade in hand that he was n’t throwing .
The strength I ’d lost was quickly returning .   
My thoughts returned .   
The sinking feeling that had started when I ’d seen that people were gunned down and quintupled when I ’d hurt the guy in the middle of the fighting lingered .
“
Who are you ! ?
”
I called out .   
“
Why do this ! ?
”
There was a bang at the back of the car .   
I looked up just in time to see someone vaulting over .   
The man with the mask , holding up someone ’s bulletproof vest as a shield between him and the heroes .
I flew away , Wretch up , and I saw the world I was flying to go dark .   
The ground beneath me illuminated , sweeping out like a ripple extending from the point of his landing .
My flight died , and I skidded to a landing , my still - frost - stiff costume skimming on a snow - slick road .
I tried to use flight to stand , then remembered I did n’t have it .   
I climbed to my feet , wary .   
The man tossed the shield aside , then rolled his head around , cracking his neck .
The cars were nearby , the ditch , the road beneath me .   
But there was no wind , and I did n’t feel the cold anymore- cool air , but not cold .   
The ground had a glow to it , like there were dim lights just beneath the snow .   
That glow was more intense toward the edge of the circle .
A ring thirty feet in diameterand past those thirty feet , there was nothing .   
Some of the cars and trucks had been cut apart , but the cut pieces still stood .
Not white , not black , not gray or anything neutral .   
It made my head hurt to look at it and to think about it .
I panted for breath , feeling the lingering weakness from the woman ’s power , and I could tell that the air here was thinner .   
I ’d experienced thinner air by flying especially high .
I could n’t fly now .   
I did n’t have my aura-
I reached for it and found nothing there for me .
I felt a mix of emotions at that .
“
Why ?
”
I asked him .
“
For Noontide and me ?   
Money .
”
“ Mercenaries . ”
He nodded .   
He tested and shifted his grip on the long - handled axe he carried .
“ If you help anti - parahuman types like this , they ’ll take advantage of your help now and then they ’ll try to come after you later .   
It ’s what happened in Russia , when they tried to control the parahuman population .
”
“ I ’ve been to Russia .   
Contracted there .   
I ’ve seen it .   
The before , the after , the attempts to make parahumans into military .   
Each one assigned to a squad or special force .   
Pit against each other .   
There ’s nothing you can tell me about that kind of reality I have n’t touched with all five senses .
”
“
These anti - parahuman guys-
”
He scoffed , sharply enough to interrupt , the noise muffled by the mask that covered his lower face .   
“
If you ’re saying that to try to bait me into revealing something about who hired me , save your breath .   
You ’re making yourself sound stupid .
”
I felt more like myself as I tried to assess the situation .   
I had to trust that my teammates and Foresight were handling things and keeping the gunmen from going on the offensive , now that the way was clear .   
There was nothing I could do to break this effect .
“
People who would hire you to go this far are going to turn on you .   
I know the unwritten rules stopped applying over the last two years , but the behavior of people , from good people to the scummy sorts that would sign off on this ?   
That still applies .   
It will always apply .
”
“ Are you finished ?
”
“
That ’s up to you , ” I said , ducking my head a bit .   
I needed to look smaller .   
Less dangerous .   
Talking was making me run out of breath , the thin air working its effect on me .   
But talking was better than the alternative .   
“ Power nullification ?
”
“ Everything nullification .   
No powers , no outside help .   
You , me , and the arena .
”
I wanted to pace , to encourage him to do it too , to maintain an even distance between us .   
It did n’t happen .   
That kind of pressure and maneuvering required a roughly equivalent power .   
I had to be something more than a twenty - one year old woman , unarmed , against a man five inches taller than me who was armed with an axe .
Maybe a Trump power , but I was n’t betting anything on it .   
I knew Trump powers tended to arise , though not always , when a person triggered in relation to power - based stressors .   
I knew they tended to feel disconnected from humanity , much like breakers did , just like how movers reported being chronically restless or having trouble setting down roots .
Shaker power , yes .   
Area or environment focused .   
Changing the battlefield .   
Shaker powers fell roughly in line with contextual or environmental threats .   
They were mindful of those things , usually .   
Context .   
Environment .
“
The city ca n’t take much more of this .   
Don’t- ca n’t you see that if all of this goes to shit , there wo n’t be anything nice left for you to spend your money on ?
”
“
It ’s handled , ” he said .   
“
I ’d fret more about myself , if I was you .
”
I wished I still had the assault rifle .   
I ’d let it slip from my fingers after ‘ Noontide’ had knocked me out for a second .   
I backed up a bit , reaching out to the side .   
The bounds of the circle were like a solid wall .
While I focused on that , he was looking around , studying … the    cars ?   
Why ?
I did n’t know what to expect here .
Slowly , he nodded , as if he ’d assessed the situation .
I felt weirdly okay , de - powered .   
My heart was pounding , but I felt focused , and all of the emotions that had surrounded things were gone .   
It was as if the power effect cut me off from all the pains and suffering of the rest of the world .
The-
Rain .   
There ’d been no onset , and I was naturally resistant , but I ’d felt the emotion creep over me .   
Doubt , frustration , regret for my failings in the moment .
Was that why people had n’t felt the fear aura in the same way ?   
Had Rain ’s power diluted it or added some lavender into the mix , diluting the dark green ?
He took a step forward , closing in on me , his axe in one hand .   
As I ducked left , he moved to cut me off .   
I headed the other direction , toward the cars he ’d been looking at , and he took a step to the side , ready to block and take a swing if I tried it .
The cars that had concerned him – he ’d been looking around them .   
Was there a way through ?   
Through a window , past the boundary of this circle ?   
It did n’t feel like it made sense , but I looked anyway .
He took that opportunity to reach for something at his belt .
A canister of something .
I hurled myself at him .   
I felt battered and sore and clean emotion ran through me as I threw myself into the jaws of the lion .
The ground was slippery .   
I almost lost my footing as I ran .
I saw the axe move , brought back to swing , and kept one eye on the ground .   
I could n’t afford to lose traction in a key moment .   
One of my feet touced on secure ground , in the track where tires had melted ice , the second following , landing further down that same line .   
The third- it had to be where the Kenzie van or one of the other vehicles had turned off , because snow and ice had scattered and been pressed down .
He was watching as much as I was .   
He timed his swing for when I closed the distance .   
I could hear it cut through the air .   
When I ducked , using my footing on still - clear ground to adjust my position and
half - throw myself to one side , he brought the canister to his axe - hand .   
As I scrambled to my feet , he spared a finger to pull the pin , and then let it tumble from his fingers , dropping to the ground at his feet .
“
No outside factors .   
Stuff like guns and explosives are a bad idea , so do n’t think of surprising me with one .   
The sound and shock has nowhere to go but inside you .   
The circle probably thinks it makes it a level playing field , ” he said .   
“
Your problem is gon na be that I do n’t believe in level .   
This is my arena .
”
Something was hissing out , but I could n’t see the vapor of it .   
Invisible gas .
“ Take your time , time I spend in here is time I do n’t have to be out there , and my side ’s winning , ” he said , his eyes narrowed as he reached with his free hand to get into his neckwarmer .   
He pulled out a tangle of tubes , with what looked like a pacifier sans bulb and a nose piece .
He began to put the breathing apparatus under his mask when I started forward again .
I ’d fought big before .   
I ’d grown up roughhousing with Uncle Neil .   
Manpower .
He took one swing as he backed up a step , in a way I would have called casual or lazy if it had n’t been fast .   
No aim in mind , timing did n’t matter , it just forced me to get clear and get away .   
Keeping the distance between us while the gas accumulated .   
It bought him the time to get the breathing apparatus on .   
His thumb flicked something beneath the neckwarmer , and then he tucked it beneath his body armor .
I would have done something about the canister , but we were inside a confined space .
His weapon required reach .   
It had been the case with Uncle Neil when I ’d been twelve , when he ’d been grown , strong , and capable of keeping me at arm ’s length .
My goal was to get inside that reach .   
I started forward , saw him react , ready to chop at me from the side .   
I found good footing , and lunged for real this time , a second after the fact .
He swung from the side , aiming for my midsection , and I dove , going low .
His foot came out , stopping me as I skidded on the surface that made footing so difficult .   
He shifted to a two - handed , overhead swing-
and I went after his legs , tangling mine with his .
He ’d expected that much , and shifted his footing , but he had n’t watched his own footing as much as he ’d watched me and mine .   
There was just enough slip for me to get one foot to skid a short distance , to topple him .
I was n’t willing to wait for him to get his bearings .   
I used the spikes on the back of my glove like an ice climber might use an ice pick to get leverage while on a tough climb .   
Burying them into his leg , possibly getting more armor and padding than I got leg , I was able to spin myself around , so my feet were pointed closer to his face .   
I ’d hoped to get a boot to his jaw , but he twisted away , his back flat on the ground .
He still had the axe .   
He still had it in roughly an overhead position , and with his back flat on the ground , he was in a position to swing .   
He brought it down and at me , and I brought my foot out , kicking at the hands , before the axe could come down .
It broke his grip and interrupted the swing before it could reach peak momentum .   
It did n’t disarm him , though , which meant I did n’t have time .
It was a short , desperate scramble before I could leverage my way forward , bringing my face closer to his , while he grabbed me , trying to keep me in place so he could swing one - handed .   
I spiked the grabbing hand , threw myself on top of him so my shoulder touched the bicep of his axe- arm and limited the ability to swing , then reached for the neckwarmer , tearing the tubes away with the reversed claws .   
Tearing them away in a way that destroyed them .
It cost me .   
He brought the axe down , but with my face being closer to his and the limited swing range , he could n’t bring the blade down to make contact with me .
He did bring the metal end of the axe down .   
The butt end had a spike on it , and the end glanced off my mask and caught me at the side of my head .   
I felt the sharp crack of something hard touching bone without any cushion in between , and then there was blood in my eye .
I did n’t dare breathe .   
He was strong , bigger , and my only benefit was that I had spikes on my gloves .   
Even that was matched , because he had bracers with jutting bits at the front that hurt like hell when he jabbed me and hit me with them instead of with his hands .
I ’d been going after faces for a reason .   
If these people existed out there , anywhere in the city , I wanted them to be recognizable .   
I wanted destroyed jaws , broken noses , and black eyes , if not claw marks or anything else .
Anger drove me .   
The image of all those people lying on the bloodstained battlefield and what had happened to the Navigators was flashing through my head as I fought for what it took to keep going , keep hurting him .
He shifted , and he got one knee or one foot between myself and him .   
I could feel the flex , and I knew he was going to kick me off him .   
I could n’t afford to let him .   
I brought my hands down and hooked the spikes into the sides of his neck , closer to the spine than the front .   
The action and my center of gravity brought my face close to his .   
Blood dripped down from my scalp wound onto the white mask .
Each of his hands found my forearms , and struck my arms out and away from his neck .   
I might have nicked him , but I did n’t take much flesh with the motion .   
My center of gravity being what it was , with me on top of him , my face smashed into his .   
The scalp wound shed blood straight into his eye .
His footing against my midsection shifted , one closer to my chest , and he kicked out , leveraging me away .
I hit road , and cold wind blew past me .   
I took in half a lungful of air , and the air burned my nostrils , mouth , and throat .
There was noise all around me .   
The circle was gone .   
I started to rise to my feet , reaching for my flight , and more coughing overtook me .
Again , I felt something in me go .   
Again , I blacked out , except it was longer than the one second this time .   
No flight , no movement at all .   
I came back to , took the start of a breath in , and again , I felt the burn .   
Reflex actions .
Noontide .
“ Victoria !
” a voice .   
“ Behind you !
”
It took all of my energy to turn to look behind me , the direction I ’d felt everything go .   
Noontide was in one of the vehicles , wheels spinning to find traction .
Then the sedan had its traction and it lunged .   
It was aimed straight at me and at the ditch .   
It lunged as it took over .
A hand grabbed me .   
It was Sveta who pulled me clear .   
With all the strength and energy Noontide had sapped from me , I would n’t have been able .
The car continued on its way , to where Tristan had made the    bridge that had let them cross the ditch and get to the crime scene .   
It was only just reaching that bridge when bridge became water .   
The sedan struck the edge of the ditch nose - on .   
Airbags inside inflated .
“
What are you doing ! ?
”
Sveta raised her voice .
I thought it was me .   
Then I realized Rain ’s effect was still in place .   
The guilt , the easy switch to self - blame .
There were still people with guns .   
Sveta held onto me and dragged us to cover .
Anelace was still in the midst of it .   
He ’d brought knives to a gunfight and he was winning .   
There was a choreographed pace to how he fought , like he anticipated every bullet .   
He fought to stay in close , to make it so one person that was fighting with him was a harder shot for everyone else .
“ They have two rocket launchers , Victoria , ” Sveta said .   
“ Saved for the hard targets .   
They clipped Brio and they got the camera .
”
I set my jaw , tried to summon the strength to move , and ended up coughing .   
A bit more summoning
and I managed to move , holding myself up .
“
I ’m trying to keep them from shooting , but they split up .   
Help .
” I nodded , not trusting myself to speak .
No questions about whether I was okay .   
There were more pressing concerns .
“ One cape hiding in the traffic off to the side , ” Sveta said , indicating with one hand .   
“
He ’s a mover , made some of their injured disappear !
”
Then she was gone , pulling herself away .
I had to assume the other person with the rocket launcher was at the opposite end of the crowd to the end that Sveta had headed to .   
I wished I had a better sense of what was going on .   
I wished I could see , with the stinging blood weeping from my scalp to my eye , beneath the metal of my mask .
With the chaos , people trying to get clear of Anelace and his knives , and
the fact that everyone in the field was either shot or behind cover , there was n’t as much focus on shooting anymore .   
They were organizing .   
Groups of this haphazard militia consolidated , forming ranks to protect key people and groups .   
The capes did n’t count- nobody was going to help Noontide , but they were gathering around the two - man team with the rocket launcher .
The time I spent looking was time they spent noticing I existed .   
Some raised rifles , handguns , and other weapons to point at me .   
I flew for cover , one of the parked cars by the side of the road , close to the field .
Wretch still out , I put my hands on the car and I pushed .   
Wheels resisted more than they skidded , the Wretch broke a window and tore at the metal , and I thought the vehicle might roll- too much .
A shift to one side helped- and the back end swung their way .   
With that movement , the front end moved some too .   
I ’d hoped to ram them , disabling the majority , but instead they scattered .
“
-clear !
”
I heard a voice .
The rocket launcher .
I flew , putting myself in the way of the rocket , Wretch active .
They fired .   
Pulling the trigger when a target presented itself , instinct more than smarts .
It was loud , but the upper ends of the sound were dampened by the forcefield , making it sound more like a loud noise from a television that could n’t be set to an ear - hurting volume .   
Heat and fire rolled around the Wretch and surrounded me , and as the Wretch went down , the air exchanged that had been protected along with me mixed in violently with the hot air immediately beyond it .   
My hair stirred and I was reminded of how much my mouth , nose , and scalp hurt .
The blast had been unexpectedly close to them , I was pretty sure .   
Most of the people in that group were reeling now .
I used my power , intent on keeping them reeling .   
My aura pushed out , and I saw the reactions on their faces .   
Bewilderment .   
Eyes wide .
Again , that mix of emotion ?   
That fear and regret could somehow mix into something else ?
No … was it actually awe ?   
In a twisted , upside - down world , my powers warped , my enemies looked up to me and my allies feared me ?   
Was that how it worked ?
No .   
Only in this scenario .
Something was fucked up .   
I kept the aura burning as I stalked closer .   
None raised their weapons against me .
“
Tell me who you are .   
Who sent you ?
”
“
We ’re spear team two , ” came the response from one wide - eyed woman .   
“
We ’re with-
”
“ Tracy , ” a man barked .   
I loomed , using my flight to draw in closer .   
He cowed , then said , “ Sorry .
”
“
Do n’t be sorry .   
Tell me .
”
“ Ca n’t , ” he said .   
“
Ca n’t .
”
“ Teacher ?
” I asked .   
I did n’t see a glimmer of recognition .   
“ Cheit ?
”
Nothing .   
I saw the man clench his jaw , eyes unfocused as he stared into the sun that was my aura .   
The clench and his stance suggested he ’d found some grit , and it would take some arm twisting to get him to talk .
Arm - twisting .   
I looked for the man I ’d hurt , letting the Wretch nearly tear his arm off .   
Gone already .
My head snapped around the other way as I heard the sound of the other rocket launcher going off .
It sailed toward the center mass of our team .   
Ashley , one hand at her middle stood straight , putting herself in the path .   
It was Byron who supported her to minimize the recoil .
She was n’t directly in front , so she had to shoot off to the side .   
She produced a blast and sustained it .   
The blast caught the projectile , destroyed it , and ate the worst of the detonation .   
Fire laced through the darkness and spilled out from gaps in licks and tongues .   
People near her shied away .
Byron eased her to the ground , presumably in the same way he ’d lifted her up .   
The white of her costume looked half red with her own blood .
How had they shot ?   
Sveta- Sveta was unconscious , with Noontide on the quick approach , a knife in each hand .   
I took flight .
I passed by the glowing bubble where the guy I ’d fought was presumably fighting Anelace , and I could see their blurry outlines within .   
Hand to hand combat .
A bullet clipped the Wretch , and I dropped down low , still closing the distance .
Sveta roused , just in time to see Noontide moving her hand around , ready to use her power again .   
I was n’t close enough .
I saw Sveta ’s neck thicken- unfurl .   
A clasp had been undone .   
Shorter tendrils reached out and seized Noontide ’s face and arm .
“
Do n’t !
”
I called .
She turned her head to look at me , eyebrows knit together , eyes wide .   
Scared .   
Then Noontide moved , and the tendrils reacted .   
The narrow ones cut into skin as they constricted .   
Larger ones twisted and dug in .   
The mask broke as tendrils stressed it .
I could see the wince on Sveta ’s part at the sight , seeing what had just happened .
She let go of Noontide as quickly as she ’d grabbed on .   
The body slumped to the ground .
“ Sveta !
”
I called out .
The agitation was bad enough that she could n’t bring the tendrils together to cinch the neck - clasp back together .
“
She ’s fair game , okay ! ?    
She and the guy with Anelace right now are killers for hire !   
The non - capes are n’t !   
They ’re under the influence of something !
”
I saw the nod , jerky .   
She was still fighting it .
“ Easy .   
Bricks in a wall , remember ?
”
“ I made the choice , Victoria , ” Sveta said .   
“
I undid the clasp .
”
“ You defended yourself .   
I talked to the other guy in this trio .   
Trust me when I say it ’s okay .   
They ’re fucked up , dangerous , and effective enough to exercise both of those other things to their full capacity .   
Okay ?
”
I saw the agitation settle some .
“
Trust me , ”
I said .   
“
I saw all of it .   
I talked to him .   
She would have left you no choice .
”
The agitation settled more .   
Sveta buckled the strands in .   
Hands fixed her hair .
I glanced at the bubble .   
It had popped – no noise , no fanfare .   
The guy who ’d fought me was backing up , clearly bloodied not just by me but by a number of knife slashes .   
Anelace slumped against the side of a car instead of pursuing .
There were several others with guns in the vicinity .   
Anelace did n’t budge as they approached .   
I tensed , ready to act-
It did n’t matter .   
In front of Sveta , Noontide ’s body went up in smoke .   
One by one , the people who ’d been shooting at us began to disappear .   
The retreating arena man .   
Shooters .   
Rocket launcher people .   
The awed people that had n’t picked up a gun or returned to being aggressive since I ’d talked to them .
Leaving one- the teleporter , who apparently could n’t teleport themselves .   
I flew after them , but Crystalclear got to him first .   
The guy , skinny with ‘ troll’ hair in a gelled point above his head , thin beard and mustache , had something in his hand .
Sveta staggered to her feet .   
I steadied her .   
Together , we hurried to that scene .   
One more person .
I pushed out with my aura .   
The teleporter spooked in a visible way , and Crystalclear found enough of a grip to pry
the guy ’s hand open .   
A capsule pill , that Crystalclear quickly stepped on .
“ I could n’t blast him while he was weaving through real people , ” Crystalclear said .
“
It ’s okay , ” I said .   
I was n’t sure it was .   
There was so much about what had just happened that was n’t okay .
I looked at Sveta , and I saw thin traces of crimson along one side of her face , forming little diamond shapes because different tendrils had slapped against it from different angles .
I touched my scalp .   
Stitches would be needed .
“ You got this ?
” I asked .
Crystalclear nodded , the crystals on his head catching the light with the movement .   
“
I ’ll call for help .
”
I flew , and I turned in the air as I did it , surveying .   
The battlefield first-
all traffic still stopped .   
Civilians scared and scattered .   
The attackers gone .   
The cars that Foresight and our other heroes had come in had been trashed .   
Rain ’s projectiles had chopped up some of the enemy
’s cover , forcing them into tighter places .
A surgical strike .   
Capes who , as far as I could tell , had been hired with the role clearly in mind .   
Weapons , tools .
Finale ’s wail formed the bulk of the background noise .   
I spared a glance , even though I did n’t want to see .   
Her teammates were hurt , not dead .   
They looked as concerned about her being upset than she was about them being shot , but they did n’t have a lot of strength to communicate to her when she was this loud .   
I could see Recycle and Retouch peering around the wall Tristan had made , currently badly chipped from bullets .   
They looked kind of shocked that things had stopped .
Guns were scattered around Brio , but he was n’t the one who had used them .   
Relay sat on the cold ground , staring up at the sky .   
The weapons had been pulled from Brio
’s person and used by Relay .   
No efforts were made to stem Brio ’s blood loss , no efforts made to watch his vitals or talk to him , and Relay had no ability to tend to others .   
Maybe he told himself that they were all already getting help .   
Maybe there was more to it .
The camera box was missing a good quarter of its components , because it had been hit by a rocket , or by the edge of the blast .   
The box and the tree had been used as cover , even though the box was n’t that large .   
Fragments of Byron ’s wall littered the area .
It meant someone could lie behind it and maybe not catch a bullet .   
Swansong lay in the snow and dirt with her back to the others .
“
How do I look in crimson ?
” she asked .
“ Shitty , ” I said , and my voice was rough from the gas .   
“
Do n’t ever wear it again .
”
She did n’t smile .   
She pulled a hand away from her neck .
“
Put that hand back , ” I said , my voice hushed .   
I pressed down on her hand with my own .   
“
It ’s not bleeding as much as it could be .
”
She did n’t respond or smile .   
I approached the box , floating closer , and I saw Rain and Byron huddled over .
“ Look after her ?
”
Swansong asked .   
“
I do n’t trust myself to get close .   
I want to , make sure to tell her that .
”
“
She heard , ” Rain said .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
I stepped around the box and around Byron .
Rain had supplied fabric to form the improvised bandage .   
Lookout was n’t moving much , lying on a bed of Tristan ’s power .
“ Tristan caught a bullet , ” Byron said , quiet .   
“
He should hold until we get to a hospital .   
He ’s in stasis where he is right now .   
It did n’t hit any vitals .
”
“
Good to know , ” I said , my voice tight .   
“
Hey Lookout .
”
I saw her move her hands a bit .   
Her face was n’t visible with the mask she wore .
“
What are you doing getting shot ?
” I said .   
“
I do n’t advise it .
”
“ You got shot before , ” Lookout responded , ghost - quiet .   
“ Arm .
”
“ I ’m speaking from experience , are n’t I ?
” I asked .   
“
What do you say I fly you to a hospital ?
”
“
What about Swansong ?
”
“ Come on , ” I said .   
“
Swansong ’s tough .   
You ’re not .
”
Lookout did n’t fight me as I scooped her up , Rain and Byron helping .
“
Warn the team with Advance Guard and the Shepherds , ” I told Rain and Byron .   
“
I think the people who attacked were compelled , under the influence , or something , and they were n’t team one .   
The other team ’s at risk .
”
“
They might not believe us , ” Rain said .
“ Try , ” I said .   
“
You comfortable ,
Lookout ?
”
“ As comfortable as I can be with two bullets in me , ” she whispered .   
“
How was I the only one who got shot twice ?   
I ’m a small target ?
”
I talked to her as I floated up .   
“
I ’m going to need you to keep talking to me the entire way there .   
It ’s going to be how I know you ’re still alert ,
okay ?   
Let me know if you get cold .
”
“
Oh kay , ” she said , like it was two separate words .   
“ You have to ask me to do something I ’m bad
at , huh ?
”
“
Talking a lot ?
”
“
Yeah .   
I ’m
joking .   
I ’m not very funny .   
Blame the bullets .   
Maybe one hit me in the funny bone .
”
“
Ha ha ,
” I said , without humor .
As I took flight , turning my body so I caught the wind and the eleven year old in my arms
did n’t , I had a view of the bloodstained field .   
I shifted my orientation and my grip , and set my eyes on the wound in the sky where the portal in Brockton Bay had been ripped open wide .
That would be the direction we were going .
Things had changed .   
From a city of gold to a city of crimson .
⊙
“
I ’m
sorry
I could n’t meet you face to face , Victoria , and
that you had to take a detour .   
Other things are demanding our presence and focus .
”
“ Trust me , ”
I said .   
“
I totally get it .   
Things are bad right now .
”
I approached a window .   
The streetlights were on , and the city beyond was dark .
Evening-
no .   
After dark .
“
Can I ask how your team is doing ?
”
Dragon asked .
“
I ’m too used to Lookout , because my first impulse is to be surprised that you did n’t look it up on hospital computers first .
”
“
Admitting that sort of thing gets you in trouble , ” Dragon said , over the phone that I ’d set to speaker .   
“
I asked because I wanted to hear it from you .
”
I looked away from the window , and at the old computer with the round monitor and its slightly fishbowl screen .   
Green text on a black background flew across the screen .   
My device on the desk was more modern , with a red light flashing violently on the top as it accepted the data .
“
In surgery , recovering , in for a third surgery , worrying , waiting in the dark , recovering , and … attending this meeting , I guess .   
It ’s a mess .
”
“ Hopefully things will level out .
”
I shook my head .   
“ Advance Guard killed villains who had been hired to ambush that coalition .   
Our warning got to them too late , that this looked set up .   
It ’s agitated things pretty badly- at least on our end there were some civilian witnesses .   
There ’s a lot of question marks .   
People are scared .
”
“ I wish I could do more .   
I ’m being watched too carefully to intervene in subtle ways , and the only unsubtle help I could provide would be deploying my machines .   
I do n’t think that would calm the public .
”
“
No , ” I said .   
“
Knowing someone ’s out there who has our back is … really nice .   
It ’s appreciated .
”
“
It looks like we ’re halfway done , ” Dragon said .   
“
Then you can get back to looking after them .   
I ’m sorry that the timing is awkward .
”
“ This will be helpful for my looking after me , if nothing else , ” I said .   
I was so tired .   
“ Something to read on all the nights I ’m not sleeping .
”
I could see the files as they disappeared into my storage drive .   
DEPT_26.fold , DEPT_27.fold , DEPT_28.fold .   
Folded files that each supposedly contained the notes and pertinent details of major PRT departments .
“ How much of this is redacted ?
” I asked .
“
Some , ” Dragon answered .   
“ Enough to protect identities of heroes .
”
“ And identities of villains ?
”
“
Very few .   
If you need access to something redacted , you can ask me .   
We ’ll discuss .   
I imagine you ’re thinking of Tattletale ?
”
“ I was n’t thinking of anyone particular .
”
“
She ’s the one you have the most history with , who is most active and in opposition to you .
”
I saw my reflection in the window as I turned my head to look out at the city .   
I touched the stitches at my scalp .   
“
Is she ?   
Redacted , I mean .
”
“
No .   
But if you did open that file , I ’d wonder what your motivations were .
”
“
Answers , I guess .   
Who she is .   
Why she is the way she is , ” I said .   
“
What she wants .   
What the hell happened to my hometown .
”
“
In the eyes of Mrs. Wynn , you earned the right to know .   
You bartered for the files , you get them .   
In my eyes , our eyes , if I include Defiant , who is beside me right now , being in Mrs. Wynn
’s
favor is n’t necessarily a good thing , but we ’re willing to extend the trust because you ’re doing what you ’re doing for good reasons .
”
“ Thank you .   
And thank Defiant for me .   
I appreciate the faith .
”
“
Done .   
Be careful around Mrs. Wynn , Victoria , ” Dragon said .
“ I will .   
I know .
”
“ We ’re almost done .   
I ’m including some files I found in my backups .   
I do n’t know if Lookout kept track or managed those things , but it ’s notes for her old work that she submitted to the PRT , and
the specs from the testing division .
”
“
She was enough of an unknown for the testing division ?
”
“ The director wanted to cover all the bases .
”
“ I hope she likes it , ” I said .   
“
Getting shot ’s a bit of a downer .   
Having your friends get shot , allies die , your work destroyed , and the investigation stalled is pretty devastating too .   
Missed our deadline .
”
“ I ca n’t tell if you ’re still talking about Lookout , ” Dragon said .
“
Any word on the villain meeting ?
”
“
It went as one might expect .   
They ’re angry .   
If the culprits of the attacks last night and today are there , they ’re in good company .
”
“
Or they ’re fostering the dissent .   
Any idea on who is taking point ?   
Where Tattletale stands ?
”
“
On leadership , no .   
Tattletale has declared herself neutral in this .   
In the revenge , dominance , asserting of strength that the other villains are intent on .
”
“
Good for her , ” I said .
“ Not quite , ” Dragon said .
A voice came through the speaker .   
It took me only a second to realize who it was .
“
I ’m still available for sale , but prices are tripling , because I have other things to focus on .   
Normally I ’d try to steer this ship , but if you guys want to set things on fire … have at it .
”
“
What are the prices ?
”
“ If you have to ask , Hock , you ’re not in a position to pay .
”
“ Fuck .
”
“
Any takers ?   
Hands up
so I know …
” I frowned .
“ We do n’t have visual , but we do know there were takers , ” Dragon said .    
“ Cradle was one .   
I know
he ’s a person of interest to your team .
”
“ Cradle and Love Lost are at odds , and Tattletale was telling us to help Love Lost .   
Maybe she ’s pulling something , ” I said .   
I made a face .   
“
Things get so much messier when she ’s involved .
”
“
You ’re not wrong , ” Dragon said .
“
Thank you for this , ” I said .   
I ’d noticed the light had stopped blinking .
“
Again , I ’m sorry for the timing .   
I know you ’d rather be at the hospital .
”
“
No , ” I said .   
I looked out the window .   
The person in my reflection looked more angry than weary .   
“
I ’m so tired of hospitals .   
A break is good .
”
“
What ’s next ?
”
“ Investigating .   
We ’re not done .   
The deadline passed , but we still need to figure out who these guys are and how it factors in .   
Advance Guard ’s group is still out for blood , and others are following their path .   
Turning into vigilantes more than they are heroes .
”
“ I can try talking to them .
”
“
If you think that ’ll work .
”
“
Defiant is telling me he might try it .   
He might be more on their wavelength .
”
“ Cool , ” I said , feeling anything but cool .   
I was feeling heartsick , if anything .   
“
I ’m feeling like we should just cut through this Gordian knot .   
Screw the secrecy , screw decorum .   
Just … go after the masterminds .
”
“ Others have tried .   
It ’s trickier than it might seem .
” I sighed .
“ On that subject , ” Dragon said .   
“
My apologies for the awkward segue- ” I winced .   
I knew that Dragon had invited me for a reason .   
She had something she ’d wanted to talk to me about that she could n’t share over the lines .
“
-I’m putting one last thing on that drive , ” Dragon finished .
I saw it flash on the screen .   
One line .   
Another .fold file .   
Neatly compressed .
Using the trackball ,   
I navigated to the file .   
I selected it .
As the pages loaded in , I saw glimpses .
“
Ah , you just opened it , ” Dragon said .   
“
You can see why I could n’t risk others seeing .
”
Killed brother .   
Murder charges … Fallen , with relations to the McVeay … Blackmail , individual already in compromising position sought counsel , but this message was intercepted …
“
She said that if something happened to her , and if it looked like she might not return , then she wanted at least the truncated notes to go to appropriate people .   
For your team and other things .   
I tried to find people who would take on these cases and take appropriate steps .   
Your Dr. Darnall was one .
”
“
He said no ?
”
“
He said he could n’t .   
The team with your friends Weld , Sveta and Vista returned last night , and it does n’t look like anyone in particular is still looking , or if they are , they are n’t broadcasting it .
”
“
It ’s a bunch of staff that only matter to a narrow selection of people , and a few reformed monsters like Bonesaw and Nilbog .   
It does n’t compel people to put themselves out there , ” I said .
“
I cut down on the particulars .   
Only a few points that , if you were n’t already aware of them , you should be .
”
Suicidal ideation … Potential bipolar diagnosis …
“
I do n’t know , ” I said .
Pervasive feelings of betrayal , lack of trust , including in herself …
“
I should n’t be looking at this , ” I said .
The screen went black .
“ You should , ” Dragon said .
The screen came back .   
A different page , closer to the end of the document .
Chris , I realized .   
I read some of the general notes , clicked a button , and read another page .








I could remember conversations that Gilpatrick and I had had , back with the patrol group .   
Gilpatrick had worked as a PRT squad leader , and he ’d had his fair share of bad days .   
I ’d had my bad days too .   
Even ignoring the obvious , I ’d grown up in Brockton Bay .   
Gilpatrick had wanted to root out all of the ‘ powers are cool’ types .   
To reduce the roster for his school - peripheral program down to a minimum , to the people who had to be there .   
Not every school had done the same .
A half dozen men and women and three dogs now rippled with enough muscle that their skin had split in places and they could n’t move in straight lines .   
Their eyes were bloodshot and their throats produced noises like they were trying to scream while being strangled , and they hurled themselves against doors and windows .   
Inside , the members of the area ’s patrol block were all gathered together , trying to barricade doors and windows .   
Lights moved wildly , because some were using flashlights and others were doing the work , and the way those lights did n’t hold steady told me everything about how they were coping .
Gilpatrick had tried to train his squaddies for a crisis .   
To paint pictures and mix up the drudge work with some degree of strategy .   
He ’d run over the basics , had talked about chains of command , and had drilled the older students on worst case scenarios .
A squad of twenty trying to hold out against nine monsters that had once been ordinary people and animals , when any one of those monsters could rend all twenty individuals limb from limb ?   
It worked as an example .
One of the smaller dogs fought to get past the others and get a piece of the action , black froth at the corners of its mouth as it lunged , tried to climb over and was hit with one elbow , flying ten feet .
It stopped making its strangled scream sounds as it recovered from the hit , then resumed its strangled scream sounds , I could see the jerky full body contractions and expansions as it worked at breathing .
It did n’t try going back at the main wall of people and animals , who were battering at the front of the building and threatening to pummel their way through the concrete .   
Instead , it circled around .
The smaller dog leaped through a window that was n’t sufficiently barricaded , got halfway through , and scrabbled to get the rest of the way through .   
Putting my mask on , I flew after it .
People shot at the animal , and the shooting did nothing to slow it .
I collided with it , smashing it down into the floor , my forward momentum driving it across the floor .   
The Wretch hit it once before the forcefield flickered off .   
I flew up to the ceiling , back flat against the painted surface , as    the dog scrabbled to get its limbs under it .   
The muscles hampered more than anything in the moment .
I used my aura , but it agitated the room more than it bothered the dog .
“ Do n’t shoot !
”
I called out .   
“
Do n’t waste your bullets !
”
And you ’ll hit me .
“
What the hell are we supposed to do ! ?
”
a young woman shrieked at me .   
One guy in the background was audibly sobbing in his panic .
Fuck me .
“
Do you have an empty cell ! ?
”   
This was supposed to be a jail .
I did n’t get a decisive answer , only a muddle of ten voices talking at once .   
The dog was back on its feet now , and the Wretch was active .
I ’d fought mutant dogs before .   
Those had been a bit bigger , armor plated , with sharper edges , hooks , and decorations .   
This was … denser .   
It was the only way I could put it .   
I flew at its legs , expanding the Wretch out to knock its legs out from under it , then punted it across the floor .
“
Which way are the cells ! ?
”
I barked the question like an order .
A hand pointed .
“
But they ’re full !
”
“
Get over there , move people to another cell , and get yourselves into that same cell if there is n’t an escape route !   
Leave me a door open !
”
Some people headed that direction .
“ You have thirty seconds !
”
I told them .
The dog did n’t even have all four legs under it when it hurled itself to one side .   
The wall partially caved in with the impact , and the dog fell to the ground , slick body sliding on laminated flooring .   
It was on its feet again before it finished sliding .   
I could see in the background that the patrol block members that had n’t headed off to the cells were now backing up , or trying to hide behind cover .   
They ’d been paralyzed by fear and now they were being punished for their fear by being stuck in the main room of the ground floor with me and a beast that I was barely keeping under control .
To my left , at the front door of the building , the drumming of fists against the door was causing the metal door to curve inward .   
It would n’t break , I was pretty sure- by the spiderwebbing of cracks around the frame , the pressure and the pounding would see the frame come out of the wall first .
To my right , the patrol students were down the hall , presumably at the cells , and from the sounds of it , they were n’t as organized as they could be .
I was being really fucking generous , giving them thirty seconds .
The beast made its strangled squeal at me .   
It lunged , and I did n’t retreat .   
Instead , I put my arm out for it to bite .
The Wretch expanded out from me , starting at the skin and unfolding into its true shape shortly after .   
The mutated dog did n’t catch me by the arm .   
My arm caught it by the inside of the mouth .
I used my flight , raising it up so it only had its back legs , and those legs were only barely touching the ground .   
Here and there it scratched the surface with claws and found some traction , jerking at me .   
I used my flight to correct .
Someone was aiming a gun at it while it was momentarily stuck in position .
“
Do n’t fucking shoot it , ” I growled the words .   
“
They ’re bulletproof like this .   
You ’ll just draw its attention to you .
”
I had very little experience having the Wretch active and a living combatant who would n’t be torn to shreds by it .   
I flipped myself around , arm and Wretch still in its jaws , holding its mouth open enough that it could n’t muster the strength to close its jaws and break my forcefield , and I wrapped my legs around the dog
’s neck .
It was about as tall at the shoulder as a pony , but it was muscular , and the loose skin that had torn around the expanding muscle made getting any leverage hard , but the placement of the Wretch did n’t obstruct my freedom of movement or my ability to get my legs into place .
As it fought me , scrabbling and periodically losing its footing , I began to drag it into the hallway where the students had gone .
“ Coming in !
”
I hollered the words .   
The dog responded to the holler with more struggling , which seemed to shake it more .
The jail cells were a dozen individual cages , each cage with a cot in the center and a cot against the wall , more bars and not walls separating one cell from the next .   
Most were so full that people were sitting on the ground , even in a time of crisis .   
Some had n’t risen to their feet , reacting only as I came into view .
“ We ’re still moving people !
”
“
There ’s a nearly empty cell at the back !
”
I retorted .
“
They ’re capes .
”
“
Get them out !   
Get the way clear now !
” They obeyed .   
The proximity of the snarling , struggling dog was a good motivator .   
People who had been moving between cells with armed people directing them were now backing into one cell or the other .   
I had a glimpse of the two capes .   
B - listers .   
Etna and Crested , moving into a cell with others .   
Both of them had shackles that encased their hands entirely .   
Crested ’s connected to his belt .
Doors were shut with bangs .
The length of the dog was an issue , because the door was too small for it , and as strong as I was , I did n’t have the leverage when it was this lively .   
I felt the Wretch ’s grip slip , saw how the head moved .   
I knew if the forcefield broke that I would n’t get a good chance to use it
again-
the situation would be too chaotic .
The Wretch was n’t helping , either .   
Hands and feet gripped and banged against bars and the floor .
No , if I was going to lose control , I ’d do it on my terms .   
I shucked off the Wretch , and pulled my arm free in the moment before the jaws shut .
Feet on the ground .   
I struck out , activating the Wretch in time to land hits , trying to pummel and push to work it into the doorway .
“ Behind !
”
Tristan .   
He came up behind me , gripping one of the dog
’s legs , and threw his weight against it .
Sveta went over our heads , into the cell .   
She had an attachment on her suit , an arm with long slender fingers and a face shield .   
It made her lopsided , and the landing was harder than it might otherwise be , but it did give her leverage , as the hand gripped bars , tendrils gripped the cot , and the rest of her grabbed onto the dog , pulling it in while Tristan and I pushed .
We got the dog into the cell .   
Sveta got out before the dog could recover , with me catching her and helping her to maintain balance as she landed .   
The door banged shut .
The dog threw itself against the bars .   
I did n’t see any bending or distortion in the bars .
“
Everyone okay ?
” I asked .
“
Are you asking your team or-
”
“ You , ” I said .   
“ Prisoners , Patrol .
”
“ Pretty fucking freaked out , ” someone else said .   
“
What is this ?   
That used to be one of the jail
’s dogs .
”
“ They came after a team of heroes with the same setup and plan yesterday , ” I answered .   
I turned around , looking at Etna and Crested , who were being given a wider berth by their new cellmates .   
“
Past three days , things have been going a bit downhill .
”
“ A bit , ” Tristan said .   
He rolled his shoulder , like it was sore .
“
You alright , Capricorn ?   
You ’re not healed yet .
”   
Rain was asking from the doorway that separated the lobby of the station from the hallway with the rows of cells .
“
Yeah , ” Tristan said , and it was n’t clear if he was saying he was alright or if he was agreeing he was n’t healed .   
“
We needed some muscle .
”
“ We need you in one piece , ” Sveta said .
Tristan pulled off his gauntlet , and shrugged a bit to create a gap he could reach his hand inside , between neck and armor .   
It came away rich with blood .
“ Shit , ” he said .   
He immediately switched out to Byron .
“ Could really have used his power , ” I said .
“ We ’ll get you attention ASAP .
” Byron nodded .
“
What ’s going on ?
” a man asked .   
He approached the door of one cell .   
He had a goatee made more pronounced by a jutting chin , narrow eyes , and styled hair .   
By his outfit , which was a Patrol combat uniform that had been stripped down enough for regular wear , I had to assume he was an instructor .
“
You ’re Harris ?
” I asked .
“
Yeah .
”
“ Were you here before or were you called in ?
”
“ Called in .   
We arrived and it was chaos .
”
“
The staff at this jail must have been exposed to the power effect somehow , ” I said .
“
The food , ” Rain said .   
“ On the desks , everyone ate food from the same place .
”
“
Good eye , ” Byron told him , head bowing a bit .   
He had to be anxious about his brother .   
And the constant pounding of fists on the front door .   
And the dog that was still struggling .   
Ineffectually , thankfully .   
“ They would have had to give food to the dogs .
”
“ They probably did , ” another boy said .   
He seemed young to me , which was odd when he was probably older than Rain and definitely older than Lookout .   
“
There are four K-9s here .   
One for contraband , two for regular police work , and one for search and rescue .   
One of the regulars is pregnant with a litter , she would n’t get food .
”
“ You pay attention to that stuff , huh ?
” Sveta asked .
“ I come here regularly on my shifts .
” I nodded .   
A clearer picture , now .   
We ’d come in knowing the basics , though , and the basics had n’t changed .   
The basics were bad .
I tried to compose my thoughts .   
“ Then they might have intercepted or impersonated the delivery person .   
They transformed the staff into those things .   
Bulletproof tough and strong for as long as the effect lasts .   
They must have felt unwell , called for an ambulance , I ’m guessing , and got as far as the ambulance before they started changing .   
No other reason for them to already be outdoors .
”
“
Is the ambulance staff
okay ?
” a boy asked .   
“
We saw them
but we could n’t get to them .
”
“ They were alive inside the rolled vehicle .   
Light injuries .   
I evacuated them , ” Sveta said .
“
Why ?
”
Instructor Harris asked , his eyebrows knit together .   
“
Why are they doing it like this ?
”
“ To show dominance , ” I answered .   
“
To achieve their goals , which is to hurt the local law enforcement , and to break in , but the reason they ’re doing it this way in particular is that they want to show their power .
”
On the topic of dominance , even with the main power out and the only power being provided by an emergency generator , I could see how the cells had been divided into prisoner and patrol .
Instructor Harris seemed to notice too .   
He pulled out his keys .   
No prisoners moved to take him hostage or fight for those same keys .   
They were very still , if wide - eyed with alarm .
“ You might want to stay , ”
I told him .   
“
This is a waiting game .   
While you ’re in those cells , you ’ve got metal bars between you and the attackers .   
If we can wait out the transformations , things should settle down .
”
“ Will the front doors hold ?
”
Instructor Harris asked .
I glanced at Rain .   
Rain shook his head .
“
No , ” I said .
Harris put key to lock .   
“
Senior students , I ’d really appreciate it if you were with me , but I ’m not going to make you .   
Step forward .
”
“
I ’ll help , whatever you need , ” a prisoner said .   
He was a guy with hair down to his shoulderblades and a tapered beard that touched collarbone .
“
Sorry , ” Harris said .   
“
I do n’t know you .
”
“ You get credit for courage , ” I said .   
“
Good man .
”
Byron entered the open front area of the station , stepped up onto a desk , and with his arms folded , began to create his motes of light .
“ How much property damage can we get away with ?
”
Rain asked .
“
Construction is cheap .   
At the Lyme center , I drew the line at damaging people
’s
cars-
it ’s too personal , upsets people , sets them against capes .   
The power at the center , I uprooted the wiring , but even a threat of a brief blackout is … not as personal ?
”
“
Speaking as someone who ’s dealt with having no power for long stretches at a time , it might be more personal than you ’re thinking .
”
“ I became less convinced of what I was saying before I finished saying it , ” I said .   
“
I do n’t know , Precipice .   
If you ’ve got to break stuff to save people , then that ’s fine .   
I think those things out there are dangerous , and I do n’t think people would hold it against us .
”
“
Do n’t underestimate people ’s ability to blame others , ” Byron said .
“
Yeah , ” I said .   
We ’re here right now , are n’t we ?   
“
You can put holes in the ceiling , Precipice .   
I think they ’ll accept it .
”
He looked around .   
The smaller length of arm that was attached to his elbow touched a nearby table .   
“
I was thinking floor .
”
“
Go for it , ”
I told him .
I picked up a desk , sliding it over to where the damage was worst .   
After a moment ’s consideration , I flipped it over , so the legs and struts were pointing up .   
It crashed as it landed there .
Sveta and others joined me .
“ Why upside - down ?
” someone asked .
“
They ’re strong but they are n’t balanced or coordinated , ” I said .   
“ Tripping is better than putting something heavy in their way .
”
“
What are these blue lights ?
” a girl in a patrol uniform asked .
“
A water gun , ” Byron said .
“
Are they safe to walk through ?
”
“ They ’re safe .
”
The pounding continued .   
I could see the spread of cracks .
This was going to be bad .
“
Do these guys have a firehose , containment foam , nets ?   
Anything like that ?
” I asked .
“
No , ” Instructor Harris said .   
He sounded pretty grim , and he looked anxious .   
More annoyingly , he was n’t really helping .
“
You sound pretty sure for someone who does n’t work here , ” Rain said .
“
It ’s the same building layout as the one we operate out of , ” Harris answered .   
“
Except instead of the cells we have a shower room .
” Made sense .   
Many of the buildings were prefabricated , arriving on trucks and put together like assemble - it - yourself furniture .
“
Besides , ” he said .   
“ Water pressure here is n’t all that .
”
“
I was n’t asking for the water .   
I was asking because it ’d be tough for them to tear , and I could tie them up .
”
“ I do n’t know what to tell you , ” he said .   
He was watching the cracks expand .   
Concrete was coming out of the widening cracks in dribbles and tufts .
“
Where were you a squaddie ?
”
I asked , as I used a burst of my strength to send a desk skidding across the floor .
“ I was n’t , ” he said .   
“
I was admin in a PRT office .   
Beartown .
”
A paper pusher ?   
The distinction between an office and a department was a pretty big one .   
The office would be the kind of place that serviced a town like the one Ashley had come from .   
The department was the kind of place that served Brockton Bay , New York , and any other cities that were large enough or in dire need .   
There had been sixty - five or so at the time the world had ended .
So not just a paper pusher , but a paper pusher in a workplace that had twenty employees at most .
“
How many capes ?
”
“ Two of us , two of them .
”
Correction : eight employees at most .   
Probably an office with three to five people in it .   
Fuck .
“
I ’m willing to follow orders if you want to lead ,
” I said .
“
Are you ?
” he asked .   
He sounded slightly surprised .
“
Yeah .   
But I really hope you want to
and you ’re able , ” I said .
“
No , ” he said .   
“ I do n’t and I ’m not .
”
“
Focus on your kids , then .   
Keep them in one piece .   
Some are freaking out , ” I said .
The pounding continued .   
The dribbles were now more like brief waterfalls , contiguous along the long horizontal crack above the door .   
It was ready to fall .
Sveta used her modified arm , slender fingers on a feminine hand moving furniture to stack chairs in the cups formed by the struts and legs of desks .   
The arm was one piece of a greater project .   
She was strong , really , and her ability to pull and constrict was being leveraged into mechanical movement .   
The only difficulty was the lack of balance and how she had to brace most of the rest of her body .
Still , she seemed more happy with having a human limb writ large than she ’d been with the tentacles .
Or content , if not quite happy .
I looked around .   
Side windows had been blocked with rock- Tristan ’s work , before he ’d joined me and helped at the cell .   
I could see the food wrappers and half - eaten dinners .   
The ones that were possibly laced .
I added more chairs to the mix , kicked over some garbage bins , and then stepped back .
The pounding was less sharp than before .   
The impacts were heavier .
They ’d sensed or seen the movement
and now they threw their bodies against the wall instead of punching or clawing at it .
“ How long since you got the call ?
”
I asked Harris .
“
Thirty-
”
The wall shifted , the scraping and crunching loud enough to drown out Harris’ reply .
The villains had attacked the Shepherds earlier in the day , and the transformation had lasted for longer than thirty minutes .   
They ’d estimated close to an hour , after talking to the people who first sighted the changed people .
“
If someone gets dosed somehow , we need to get them into a cell before they chage , ” I said .   
“ Harris ?
”
“ We ’ll try .   
They ’re already sardines .
”
“
Better a sardine than dog food , ” I answered him .
“
It took a while to change , ” Byron said .
“ I ’ve been reading up on tinker transformations and the kinds of drugs they make , ” I replied .   
Again , there was an impact that shifted the whole wall .   
“
They can change it up .   
Force a faster change , but weaker or less predictable .   
Or more side - effects for the victim .
”
“ Why are you reading up on tinker transformations ?
” Sveta asked .
“
A topic for another time , ” I told her .   
“
Right now we need to focus on this .   
It occurs to me , now that I ’m thinking about side effects , if this does wear off , we need to make sure they have medical care .
”
Another impact .   
I could see where the cracked segment of wall stood apart from the rest of the wall now .
“
Nobody shoots , ” I ordered .   
“ Save your bullets .
”
The wall came out-
I thought it would fall , but it remained suspended .   
Everyone in the room tensed .   
There was so much floor space where the desks had been .   
Our arena .   
If they got past that open space , then civilians were in danger .
“
I ’m
gonna-
” Rain said .
“
Do it .
”
“
Not the floor yet , ” Byron said .
Rain created his blades .   
He flung them , and they hit the door , criss - crossing it .
It was a hulk of a man that came tearing through , stumbling when he broke through with more ease than expected .   
He was taller than normal , with arms like tree trunks , fingers lost in the mess of muscle , blood streaked his body and the rags he wore .
His stumble carried him into the mess of desk and chair legs .   
They caught his legs and feet and as easy as it was for him to get into it , it was hard to extract- hard to do it when barreling forward .   
He fell .   
Others were following after , and they ran into the same barrier .
Byron did n’t use his power .
The dogs came through , over the bodies of their kin .   
A straggler , heavy around the middle with a grossly distorted abdomen , followed through .
The dogs were n’t as hampered .   
They stepped on the people and they leaped , one landing a few feet from the desk Byron stood on .
“
What are you waiting for ?
”
Rain asked .
The dog reared up , muscular club - limbs raised high , ready to crush Byron .
He used his power .   
A geyser of water that could have carried cars away , aimed at the hole .
Two remained , catching on the tangle of furniture by accident or dumb effort .   
Sveta and I each went after one .
Getting them back outside only bought us time .   
Byron was drawing out more lights , and now Rain was slashing at the floor , the slashes forming ‘ x’ shapes .
It did n’t take long for the attackers to bounce back .
“
They ’re bleeding a lot !
”
Rain shouted , as he backed up .   
“
I think the effect is softening !
”
A damn good thing he spotted that .   
If I ’d hit them when they were n’t bulletproof tough it could have been a disaster .
Fucking irresponsible to do this like this .
But it did n’t feel like anyone was being responsible right now .
They came for us , and the first three that came barreling through with feet pounding on the floor of the lobby hit Rain ’s trap .   
The ground shattered beneath their feet and they fell , chests and collarbones slamming into the edge of the hole .
I winced .   
I hoped they ’d be okay .   
Too much strength without durability could be disastrous .
Byron followed up .   
A torrent of water , to slow them down , push them back , and to turn finer debris into mud .
The air was frigid , with moisture heavy in it .
This was a losing battle .   
They came at us so hard that there really was no way to even block a hit without causing them harm , we could n’t even really redirect them .
“ Keep destroying their footing !
”
Rain did .   
My focus was on flying , on short bursts of strength to hit them and make them stagger into one another .   
If I could keep them in place long enough , they could tumble into traps .
Sveta was n’t fighting , but she was managing the ones who ’d fallen .   
If they started to climb out of the waist - deep holes , then she hauled on them or moved past them to push them back in .   
The water helped .
Ambient moisture in the air clung to my mask , the parts of my face the mask did n’t cover , and my hair , beading my costume .   
My breath fogged with the cold air that had flooded in .   
The others were n’t much better .
They did n’t stop , and the slow loss of their strength and durability was a really fucking slow one .
Rain was using his power again , and I was at the point where I could have snapped at him , cussing him out for catching me in the effect , except I would ’ve felt shitty .   
I knew he was trying , and he was finding his effectiveness now .   
I even felt bad that I was thinking about shouting at him , but I suspected that was the power .
“ I think we should have called for backup anyway , ” Byron said .
I panted for breath .   
It was painful , with the air being as cold as it was .   
I shook my head .
“ We could have tried .
”
“ They ’ve got their hands full .   
It ’s all stuff as bad as this , ” I said .
A dog that was feigning injury sprung to its feet , leaping .   
I flew to intercept and hurled it down into the thickest grouping of enemies .
I could see the fight go out of them .   
Where they ’d been incessant before , they paused , retreating .   
We were one hundred percent willing to let them , just for a chance to recover a bit ourselves .
They retreated further , then backed off , a third of them moving to one side , two thirds to another .
Past them , past the steaming air where the remaining warm air from indoors mingled with the winter air outside , I saw the culprits .
Bitter Pill .   
Medical mask only barely visible behind a scarf , white coat , and a short stick with a caduceus .   
She wore one of those packs that looked like a fanny pack , that was worn over one shoulder instead .   
Tinker stuff was attached to the strap .
Birdbrain .   
Bird mask , black coat , and a handgun in each hand , another gun at her back .   
She stood with back straight , beak pointing up-
no indication she was using her eyes to view her environment .
I saw her gun - hand move .   
As she moved it left and right , it moved as a hand normally would .   
Up and down , it was nigh - instantaneous , with automatic tracking .   
Headshots every time .   
The way her head moved around like she was daydreaming or drugged and
her hand moved with such precision was jarring .
Foggy Idea .
He ’d been in Hollow Point but he ’d ducked out of the worst of the fighting .   
He was a kid , with Einstein hair dyed gray , and a mask that covered too much of the scalp behind the hairline , eyes too far down .   
It gave him a creepy , impish look , like he was emulating a baby ’s proportions .   
His namesake fog seeped out from the collar and sleeves of his costume .
Bluestocking .   
Elegant , her trademark indigo stockings and opaque blue lenses in glasses stood out amid an otherwise gray ensemble .
A scent like really strong black licorice mixed with gasoline preceded their group .   
The mutated people and animals retreated further , heads down , bodies hunched over , subservient .
“ Pill !
”
I raised my voice to be heard .   
“
What the fuck do you think you ’re doing ! ?
”
“ I want my teammates .
”
Etna and Crested , back in the cells .
“
I did n’t think Etna was yours , ” I replied .
“ Close enough , ” Bitter Pill answered , her voice cool .   
“
Now fuck off and get out of our way .
”
“
What are our odds ?
” Rain murmured .   
He was situated where he could be heard by Sveta , Byron and I. “ Birdbrain is the big threat .   
The muscle is second to that .
”
“ I ’m flattered ,
” I heard Birdbrain ’s ethereal voice .
“
She ’s halfway to being an all - or - nothing threat .   
Like Swansong with her blasts , but with aim .
”
I saw Bluestocking turn her head , asking a question .   
Birdbrain answered , no doubt passing on what we were saying .
“
You ’re using that term wrong !
”
Bluestocking called out .   
“
All - or - nothing is n’t right ! ”
Bitter Pill said something , annoyed .   
Too far away to be heard .
“ If she aims she ’s guaranteed a hit if her gun ’s at the right point horizontally .   
Vertically , does n’t matter .   
All - or - nothings are PRT terminology for anyone who ’s strong enough that you ca n’t defend against their attack unless you defend against anything , ca n’t dodge unless you can dodge everything .   
She ’s halfway there and that makes her a good enough shot we ca n’t afford to get in an engagement .   
Headshot every time .
”
“
I ’m a game shooter ,
” Birdbrain said .   
“
Even these days .   
Killing does n’t interest me .
”
“ Game shooter ?
”
I heard Harris behind me .
“ Guns are verboten if you ’re playing by the rules of cape fights .   
Unless you use your power on a gun to augment it , pack tinker guns , or you have a power that helps you not kill what you ’re shooting .
”
Foil had been all three at one point .
“ The term applies , Blue .   
At least in part .   
She shoots , she kills , ”
I said , my voice pitched to carry .   
“ Or
…
”
“ I place the bullet to where it should take a month to heal , ” Birdbrain said .   
“
Do n’t mess with us .   
Give us what we want .
”
“ I would have thought the brains of Hollow Point would have kept their noses out of this war that ’s unfolding , ” I said .
“
All of the intel says the time is now , ” Bluestocking said .
“ Intel is one thing .   
Respectability ?   
Common sense ?
”
“
Are you trying to stall because you hope our steroid soldiers are going to return to normal ?
”
Bitter Pill asked .
“ Give us a second ?
” I asked .   
“ We have to confer .
” Bluestocking jumped in , asking , “ Leave us standing in the cold , too , why do n’t you ?
”
A bit irritable .
“
Can we win this ?
” Byron asked .
“ Birdbrain is a massive threat , Pill has tricks up her sleeve , Foggy can distract and stupefy with his gas , and Bluestocking is a thinker of some kind .
”
In the background , I saw Birdbrain nod to herself .
Was she aware she did that ?
“
The last couple of days have been back to back crisis management , ” Byron said .   
“
Yes , this is important .   
Keeping the bad guys locked up in jail , especially ones we locked up ?   
All for that .   
But what does it mean tonight , when there ’s another issue and we ’re all hurt or out of gas ?
”
I could see Rain nodding .   
Better to say that I could see Precipice nodding .   
His mask hid his expression , but his added hands allowed for more gestures , which hinted at the emotions in play .   
Fidgety , one hand raising , then dropping .
Sveta was n’t moving nearly as much .   
Even her tendrils were n’t that lively .   
She stared at the brains of Hollow Point , her expression hard .
They were exhausted .
“
We give them what they want ?
” I asked .
“
You sure ?
” Rain asked .
“
They want two capes , fine .   
But we can negotiate .
”
In the background , Birdbrain nodded again , said something .   
Reporting on what we were saying .
“
What do you think , Mr. Harris ?
” Byron asked .
Mr. Harris stared at the villains much as Sveta did .   
In a way , it was like standing at the foot of a mountain and seeing just how daunting the ascent was going to be .   
There was such a gap to be closed , and getting there was going to be so hard .
Worse , this ‘ mountain’ had no interest in making the process any easier .   
It was going to do whatever the fuck it wanted .
“
I wo n’t stop you , ” he said .   
“
If I get asked why I let it happen , I ’ll tell them it was the right thing to do .    
The way that gun moves unnerves me .
”
“ If we say no to this , we need to take a few hours off , ” Sveta said .   
“
Otherwise I feel like it ’s going to end up the same way next time .
” I nodded .   
I was n’t super happy about her mentioning that we were tired or taking a break to people who might pass that on to our enemies , but I was n’t going to get on her case about it .
“
Can we talk ! ?
”
I called out .
After they consulted , it was Bluestocking who approached , stepping over rubble .   
She had nice boots .   
Her approach made the creatures back off .
I floated closer .
What would happen if I decked her and knocked her out right now ?   
If I took a hostage , and played as ugly and as dirty as they were playing right now ?
Bitter Pill approached too , maybe because she wanted to say something .   
I looked back and met Harris ’s eyes .   
Best to connect to the real authorities where possible .
Bluestocking and me , with Bitter Pill and Harris as our seconds , I guessed .
I looked at Bluestocking , and I saw- something in the way she held herself , and what I could see of eyes behind mostly opaque lenses , and in her eyebrows .
A familiar attitude .   
I wondered if I was comparing her to anyone I knew , but when I reached for it , I could n’t place it .
It did n’t help that they stank .   
The smell I ’d noted before was emanating from them in wafts , worse when they moved .   
It was , presumably , what was keeping the mutants docile .
“ We ’ll give you the two capes you want from the jail .   
With stipulations .
”
“
Which are ?
”
Bitter Pill asked .   
She looked pissed , by the way she set her mouth and folded her arms .   
Or was it resting bitch face ?
Oh .   
There ’d been a woman at my rehab who ’d given me dirty looks .   
So that was the answer to my little mystery .
That tiny bit of closure was a note of success in a day that had been hard , bloody , and miserable in large part .
“ Nobody gets hurt .   
If you have the ability , you need to return these people to normal now , with no injuries .   
You ca n’t take them with you .
”
“
They ’ll be eighty - five percent healed up , unless you ’ve punctured a vital organ or something , ” Bitter Pill said .
“
Not good enough .   
You ca n’t go after civilians .
”
“
Can and did , ” Bitter Pill said .
Bluestocking did n’t agree , but argued the point instead , “ Cops .   
Cops are fair game .   
So are the anti - cape soldiers .
”
“
We ’re not anti - cape , ” Harris said .
“
And you ca n’t take them with you .   
They ’re not your pawns .
”
“ Could n’t if we wanted .   
They go dormant
, that ’s all , ” Bitter Pill said .   
“
No need to worry your little head over that one .
”
“
Fine .   
That ’s stipulation one , you fix them , ” I said .   
“ Stipulation two , is you need to drop some money on this place .   
Make amends , give them what they need to rebuild .
”
“ Fuck that , ” Bluestocking said .
“ Stipulation three ?   
Take a fucking break .   
Back off , do n’t pick fights , do n’t go after heroes , take three days and stop being complete dicks for that long .
”
“ We ’d lose ground , ” Bluestocking said .   
“ Numbers , social map , demos , territory , ratios …   
No .
”
“ You ’ll lose ground if some of you get broken bones , ” I replied .   
“
This is a way to do this without fighting .   
We benefit , you benefit , civilians can mend and repair .
”
“
You ’re asking for way too much , ” Bluestocking said .
“ Heal the people you hurt , make amends for what you broke , and back off for three days .   
If you want to negotiate down on any of those parts , you can give us some intel on the people who opened fire on us two days ago .
” Bluestocking sniffed with amusement .   
“ That passed under my nose before I thought to pay attention .   
I know some things , but
… you hand those two over , we ’ll give you the information .   
Nothing else .
”
“ Information , healing- ”
“ -And
that ’s it , ” she interrupted .
“
Not good enough , ” I said .
“ Fucking deal with it .
”
I turned slowly , looking up at Harris .   
He gave me a slight shrug and shake of the head .   
Resigned .
Fuck no .
I did n’t want to let them win like this .
“ Instructor Harris … stuff for Etna and Crested
is on the Captain ’s desk .   
Get them set up and bring them out ?
”
“
Yeah , ” he said , voice terse .
He jogged back .
“
What ’s it going to take to heal them ?
” I asked .
“ I have the stuff .   
Healing .   
It should get them to ninety , ninety - five percent .   
They ’ll be hungry .   
Good enough ?
”
Bitter Pill asked , a condescending note in her voice , her gaze too casual and distracted .
“
Good enough , ” I told her .
Bluestocking added , “ Small expenditure of resources .   
The fixing of this building when you did half the damage ?   
No
. ” “
How do you know how much damage we did ?
” I asked .
She gave me a look , half glare , half disdain .
I hated being ignored , patronized , and looked down on .   
I ’d triggered because it had been so oppressive .   
Now here she was , just pressing that button .
I consoled myself by telling myself that this was handled .   
Things were calm .   
We could still negotiate .
Maybe Bluestocking had some postcognitive powers .   
Past - reading , like the time camera had been able to do .
In the back , Birdbrain perked up .   
She raised her voice , alarmed .   
“ Blue !   
Bitter !
”
She was running now , catching up with our group .   
Bluestocking raised a hand , motioning for her to stop and stay back .   
She might have been thinking that this was already a two versus one discussion , and a third person would make it lopsided enough to stop being civil .
But then Birdbrain drew close enough that the alarm in her eyes was visible through the eyeholes of her bird mask .
“
What did you do ?
” Bluestocking asked .
Bitter Pill seemed to connect before Bluestocking did , because she pushed past me , hurrying toward the building .   
I motioned for the others to back off and let her through .
The others followed , with Foggy Idea trailing behind .   
Birdbrain held out her guns , threatening anyone who threatened to attack while the thinker team was surrounded .
I flew to keep up .   
I had to be ready to protect Harris
if-
He was already backing up , hands up , when the thinkers arrived at the door to the hallway .   
He ’d dragged Crested from the cell and shoved the food that had been left on the captain ’s desk into Crested ’s face .
“
Are you stupid ?
”
Bitter Pill asked .
“
Did you eat it ?
” Bluestocking asked .
“
He ate enough , ”
Bitter Pill said , sounding pissed .
“
Your call , ” I told her .   
“
You can travel with someone that ’s going to go monster and either wreck everything or refuse to budge
… or you can let them stay in this cell here .   
We ’ll wait for our reinforcements , see if they come …
”
“
Shut up , ” Bluestocking said .
“
Or you can accept my terms , and we ’ll keep this easy for you .
”
There was a long pause .
My team was standing beside me .   
I could see Bitter Pill holding a bottle so the cap was between her index and middle fingers , ready to drop it .
I wondered if Sveta would be able to catch it .
She had n’t let herself be surrounded without a trick up her sleeve .   
The question was whether she ’d throw all sense to the wind and go with that , or if she ’d take the other route .
It was Bluestocking who responded .   
“ Reduced terms .
”
“
Let ’s talk , ” I said .   
“ We give you passage with your prisoners , no fight , no hassle , we ’ll hold them and turn them over … you fix the wounded , you pay-
”
“ -Not the full price .   
Two thousand .
”
“ Pretty paltry .   
Twenty thousand minimum .
”
“
You ’re ridiculous .
”
“ They ’re your teammates .   
You risked all of this for them .   
Are you now saying they are n’t worth ten thousand each ?
”
“ We ’re not teammates , ” Etna said .
“ You ’ll fucking do a few jobs with us if we break you out , okay ? ”
Bluestocking snarled .
“
Okay , ” Etna replied .
“
Three day break from all activity , ” I said .
“ One day .   
Twenty thousand .   
We fix the injured .   
And you fucking pretend we do n’t exist while we wait for the steroid soldier drug to run its course .
” I did n’t reply , letting the others take that in .
“
Yeah , probably , ” Byron said .   
I saw Sveta and Rain nod .
“
Then fucking leave us alone , and if you try anything we ’ll bring hell down on your heads , ” Bluestocking said .   
“ Bitter has stuff .
”
“ I do .   
For a rainy day .
”
“
It ’s a fucking rainy day
when- ” We backed off , leaving them to bicker .
Harris looked more resigned than victorious when he emerged .   
When I put out my hand , he gripped it firm .
The hole in the wall meant that the snow and moisture were getting in .   
The water that Byron had created had frozen so the very top layer formed a paper - thin sheet .
The members of the patrol squads emerged .
“ We need help , ” I told the instructor .   
“
We need boots on the ground , not just heroes .   
It ’s bad right now .
”
“ I ’ll get my grads on board , ” he said .   
“
We ’ll see what we can do .
”
“ We might need seniors too .
”
“ School - age kids ?
”
“ Seventeen and eighteen year olds ?   
Older than some of us , ” I said , indicating my group .   
“
The city needs all the help it can get .
”
“ I ’ll talk to parents .   
I ca n’t force anything .
”
“ And other instructors .   
Any friends or superiors you have .
”
I saw him nod .   
He put a hand on my shoulder as he walked by , going over to talk to the most unhappy and stressed of his patrol block .
I grabbed a desk that had been tossed across the room and righted it , before sitting on it .   
Sveta plunked herself down beside me , her giant arm around behind my back and resting on the corner of the desk to my left .
I pulled out my phone , and immediately she pushed it down and away .
“
No more , ” she said .
I fought her , play - wrestling just a bit , and finally got the phone unlocked .   
I closed the chat
I ’d had open , asking for intel on this specific situation so we knew what we were getting into , and brought up the map .
The city , lit up by icons .   
Each icon had a brief bit of text , describing the situation and the report .
Incidents all over .   
Nine ongoing situations that did n’t have a team working on them , where the things were was bad enough the police did n’t have them under control , or where capes were involved , or both .
The city was on fire , metaphorically speaking , and we did n’t have what it took to put it out .   
When Kenzie had put the application together , she had n’t seemed to expect that things would get this bad , because a lot of the text was unreadable or offscreen .   
Too much at once .
This time , when Sveta pushed my hand and my phone down , I let her .
“ We need a break , ” she said .   
“
You need one .
”
“ I wanted to procrastinate , ” I said .   
“
I told myself that we ’d wait until Swansong and Lookout are out of the hospital .   
Then Lookout ended up having to stay the extra day .
”
“
She ’s out tonight .
”
“ I know .   
But … I had something to bring up and talk to the group about , and I needed time to digest it .
”
“ The files from Jeanne Wynn .   
You went to see Dragon , you got the files , and you found out something .
”
